tend to scoff at the very idea that men know better about our lives than they do and say so you ever notice how most feminist and some women immediately expect men to devalue our own lives to elevate theirs and call this arrangement equality ever notice how feminist dont like it when men add to gender discourse when the addition doesnt limit and restrict discussion ideas and perspectives to feminist only terminology their social constructs and their prejudiced methodology think of this what happens when feminist and other women allied with them say there needs to be a discussion on domestic violence then immediately direct all discussion to confirming a preconceptualized ideas of what domestic violence is and treats any perspective that doesnt agree or raise legitimate questions about dv with contempt in other words discussion is really tacit agreement with an already determined and defined perception that men are the exclusive perpetrators of dv and any participation by women in dv is rationalized away by false assertions that women perpetrate less dv or support it consider the reaction to violence with two separate incidents ray rice hitting his then girlfriend in an elevator beyonces sister repeatedly hitting jay z in an elevator one response was utter condemnation and the calls to economically ruin one persons entire life as well as destroy his livelihood the other praise support encouragement reward now ask yourself what a real discussion on dv would be like if the same social retribution was visited upon beyonce and her sister as it was upon ray rice and management in the nfl there can never be a real discussion on dv and other gender issues because women would finally be faced with certain uncomfortable truths about their gender of which full culpability and responsibility would be part of the discourse also men would be permitted to do something that does not presently occur defend our gender and put forth a perspective closer to our lived experienceswhich would completely debunk 99 of the determinants espoused by feminist to characterize men and mens feelings beliefs and expressions a real discussion a fair discussion would reveal one invariable truth about feminists they know nothing about men and what they think they know is aligned with a cartoon character of men an oversimplified caricature of men they use as the standard to stand in for men in general so while men are exposed day by day hour by hour to the womans perspective in media articles and beat over the head moment by moment with womens views ideas feelings wants whims and desires so much is dedicated to womens voices the reality is most women know very little about men beyond the caricature and cartoon presented in the main by the media and literature oh they know some things about men but only to the extent of what men are permitted to express within a society that increasingly punishes men for any expression that may be interpreted as critical of women regardless of context mgtow is in a sense the only logical rational option left for men who no longer believe their value should lay in the hands of women who require irrational selfsacrifice and subordinating our own worth to elevate the selfworth of women notice how when women tell other women to keep their money exploit mens emotions and manipulate mens to take advantage of us and not marry and not have relationships with men and how that makes them strong and independent and how they are role models for not needing to rely or need a man you dont hear a peep from other women telling them they are wrong about men and that they shouldnt manipulate mens emotions yet the moment a group of men decide to opt out of relationships with women to better their lives women automatically call them weak childish immature bitter intimidated by strong women selfish infantile a loser etc', 'all you need to know whatever your gender is that marriage is just another legally binding contract hence you must think twice and be very wary of signing the relevant document all the romantic mush it is dressed up in to hide its true nature ie a hard legally binding contract that favours women needs to be stripped away before you sign it think logically rationally about it you can get all the romantic sexual stuff even kids without marrying herhim no need to buy a cow just to get a pint of milk and there is a slightly more offensive feminist version of this that applies to buying a man which is best not repeated here honestly how can you possibly expect 2 people even in a perfect marriage to remain perfectly compatible and unchanged several years into the marriage people develop ie change over time and when that happens they may no longer be compatible nobody is to blame they just developed in different directions but the female still gets to sue for divorce and take all a mans wealth his kids home even destroy his reputation to ensure no other woman will ever want him i think marriage and commitment even a wedding etc nice traditions but in need of updating eg marriage contracts should only be for 5 year periods with option to quit or renew the contract prenups should be obligatory not merely optional and at the start of every serious engagement to be married before any jewellery goes on any fingers there needs to be official proof eg witnessed in a lawyers office signed documents etc to agree on how the relationship is to be ended if the impending marriage fails and cannot last the 5 year contract period eg who gets the kids the family home shared assets etc what each partner can or cannot do eg destroy the others reputation through malicious rumour etc to the press if they are people whose livelihood relies on being in the public eye very boring and unromantic but once that part is settled the couple can focus on all the usual romantic and sexual stuff baby production home maki g etc marriage involves traditional arranged marriages typically last so well precisely because they do a version of this ie strip all the romantic stuff away and treat it as a plain serious contract most of these societies tell young couples to forget about love and romance because it is irrelevant before the actual co tract sign ceremony just worry about getting the important stuff right eg property etc issues there are many years to be romantic after the contract is signed not before though makes perfect practical sense couples dare not break rules eg to fool around with other partners because the consequences for either gender are often very severe eg you could end up killed by your spouses family in an honour revenge killing so it serves to keep society in order harsh as it may be australian marriage laws traditions etc are so slack they render the entire institution not only meaningless and irrelevant but actually dangerous especially as feminists exploit marriage as a get rich quick scheme yet people feel a need to commit to one they love so it will never vanish which is why the marriage and all family law rules need to be revised and made more relevant to the reality of current society and fairer to men who are currently being so ruined and exploited by unscrupuless women through the family law system unless this happens the rate of violence against women is unlikely to reduce only get worse as it keeps generating increased stress and pressure on men whose typical hormonal response is the male aggression one they cannot always control if pushed too far by women eg in a legal custody or similar divorce battle the rate of female murders by men stands at one a week and rising women can do something about this tragic statistic get rid of the feminists and help save the lives of female future victims of such violence by doing so men seldom just kill for the fun of it all unless they are the rare psychopathic type of man they will have something motivating such extreme violence against women it is simply a hatred of women that develop through experience with them in many areas of life over time men are not born as woman haters have you ever seen a baby boy who hates or does not love his mother they are all born loving women but the way women treat them changes their attitude and makes them hate women enough to find the necessary energy strength i genuity etc needed to entrap and kill a woman which is quite a major exhausting job if you consider what is involved in trappi g her keeping her silenced carting her around chopping up her body or whatever the guys do not to mention the risks they take to murder a woman not that easy they would have to really hate women so much to be able to carry out such violent fears and they hate women because women as a gender have betrayed their faith and trust once the guys reach this extreme point of no return they will random kill any woman they dont are who any easy trapped victim will do because they are not seeki g reve ge on just one woman they are using their hapless random victim as a symbol of their revenge on the entire female gender that wronged them particularly feminists so if you are one you are in a sense partly guilty for the murder of other unfortunate often innocent but exposed vulnerable females if you really cared about other women not just your own selfish feminist selves you would put your money where your mouth is and change the way you treat men eg stop exploiting and degrading them as men to the point where they feel so desperate they kill women because they have no reason left to live for that means you give up your careers etc so they can have a job you dont grab all the political and other high status roles etc and you just learn to shut up and do as youre told whinge less make do with less and be grateful for it hardly rocket science for all your smart uni educated feminists to be able to grasp of course that presupposes you have a brain at all and didnt just get into uni and get a degree by buying it with money and influence ie corruption which is another discussion for another day', 'tvbridge marriage is the union of a man and a woman by god the two become one both have a responsibility to work on the marriage daily im not from the usa so things might be different there but i believe in biblical marriage ive only been married for 15 years so im still in the honeymoon stage but in my circle of friends and family all the older people have been happily married for 30 years my husbands great grandparents both made it till their 80th anniversary and had i got married younger thats what i would aspire to do i dont understand the negativity around marriage it is one of the most fulfilling experiences in life and the best environment to raise children people just need to understand that love is a decision not a feeling and both partners have to put 100 effort into it but its more rewarding than you can imagine my husband is the most wonderful person on the planet maybe not to everyone but to me i would do anything for him and he would do anything for me i just cant understand your view point it seems so twisted and ugly no wonder people are getting

all the romantic mush it is dressed up in to hide its true nature ie a hard legally binding contract that favours women needs to be stripped away before you sign it think logically rationally about it you can get all the romantic sexual stuff even kids without marrying herhim no need to buy a cow just to get a pint of milk and there is a slightly more offensive feminist version of this that applies to buying a man which is best not repeated here honestly how can you possibly expect 2 people even in a perfect marriage to remain perfectly compatible and unchanged several years into the marriage people develop ie change over time and when that happens they may no longer be compatible nobody is to blame they just developed in different directions but the female still gets to sue for divorce and take all a mans wealth his kids home even destroy his reputation to ensure no other woman will ever want him i think marriage and commitment even a wedding etc nice traditions but in need of updating eg marriage contracts should only be for 5 year periods with option to quit or renew the contract prenups should be obligatory not merely optional and at the start of every serious engagement to be married before any jewellery goes on any fingers there needs to be official proof eg witnessed in a lawyers office signed documents etc to agree on how the relationship is to be ended if the impending marriage fails and cannot last the 5 year contract period eg who gets the kids the family home shared assets etc what each partner can or cannot do eg destroy the others reputation through malicious rumour etc to the press if they are people whose livelihood relies on being in the public eye very boring and unromantic but once that part is settled the couple can focus on all the usual romantic and sexual stuff baby production home maki g etc marriage involves traditional arranged marriages typically last so well precisely because they do a version of this ie strip all the romantic stuff away and treat it as a plain serious contract most of these societies tell young couples to forget about love and romance because it is irrelevant before the actual co tract sign ceremony just worry about getting the important stuff right eg property etc issues there are many years to be romantic after the contract is signed not before though makes perfect practical sense couples dare not break rules eg to fool around with other partners because the consequences for either gender are often very severe eg you could end up killed by your spouses family in an honour revenge killing so it serves to keep society in order harsh as it may be australian marriage laws traditions etc are so slack they render the entire institution not only meaningless and irrelevant but actually dangerous especially as feminists exploit marriage as a get rich quick scheme yet people feel a need to commit to one they love so it will never vanish which is why the marriage and all family law rules need to be revised and made more relevant to the reality of current society and fairer to men who are currently being so ruined and exploited by unscrupuless women through the family law system unless this happens the rate of violence against women is unlikely to reduce only get worse as it keeps generating increased stress and pressure on men whose typical hormonal response is the male aggression one they cannot always control if pushed too far by women eg in a legal custody or similar divorce battle the rate of female murders by men stands at one a week and rising women can do something about this tragic statistic get rid of the feminists and help save the lives of female future victims of such violence by doing so men seldom just kill for the fun of it all unless they are the rare psychopathic type of man they will have something motivating such extreme violence against women it is simply a hatred of women that develop through experience with them in many areas of life over time men are not born as woman haters have you ever seen a baby boy who hates or does not love his mother they are all born loving women but the way women treat them changes their attitude and makes them hate women enough to find the necessary energy strength i genuity etc needed to entrap and kill a woman which is quite a major exhausting job if you consider what is involved in trappi g her keeping her silenced carting her around chopping up her body or whatever the guys do not to mention the risks they take to murder a woman not that easy they would have to really hate women so much to be able to carry out such violent fears and they hate women because women as a gender have betrayed their faith and trust once the guys reach this extreme point of no return they will random kill any woman they dont are who any easy trapped victim will do because they are not seeki g reve ge on just one woman they are using their hapless random victim as a symbol of their revenge on the entire female gender that wronged them particularly feminists so if you are one you are in a sense partly guilty for the murder of other unfortunate often innocent but exposed vulnerable females if you really cared about other women not just your own selfish feminist selves you would put your money where your mouth is and change the way you treat men eg stop exploiting and degrading them as men to the point where they feel so desperate they kill women because they have no reason left to live for that means you give up your careers etc so they can have a job you dont grab all the political and other high status roles etc and you just learn to shut up and do as youre told whinge less make do with less and be grateful for it hardly rocket science for all your smart uni educated feminists to be able to grasp of course that presupposes you have a brain at all and didnt just get into uni and get a degree by buying it with money and influence ie corruption which is another discussion for

Another comment highlights the risk of domestic violence towards women, specifically from male partners, and advocates for a shifting societal perspective on the issue similar to that of racism. A third comment references feminism, suggesting future parity in treatment and consideration. Another user emphasizes perceived differences between women now and in the past, suggesting that being married would lead to unhappiness.

tend to scoff at the very idea that men know better about our lives than they do and say so you ever notice how most feminist and some women immediately expect men to devalue our own lives to elevate theirs and call this arrangement equality ever notice how feminist dont like it when men add to gender discourse when the addition doesnt limit and restrict discussion ideas and perspectives to feminist only terminology their social constructs and their prejudiced methodology think of this what happens when feminist and other women allied with them say there needs to be a discussion on domestic violence then immediately direct all discussion to confirming a preconceptualized ideas of what domestic violence is and treats any perspective that doesnt agree or raise legitimate questions about dv with contempt in other words discussion is really tacit agreement with an already determined and defined perception that men are the exclusive perpetrators of dv and any participation by women in dv is rationalized away by false assertions that women perpetrate less dv or support it consider the reaction to violence with two separate incidents ray rice hitting his then girlfriend in an elevator beyonces sister repeatedly hitting jay z in an elevator one response was utter condemnation and the calls to economically ruin one persons entire life as well as destroy his livelihood the other praise support encouragement reward now ask yourself what a real discussion on dv would be like if the same social retribution was visited upon beyonce and her sister as it was upon ray rice and management in the nfl there can never be a real discussion on dv and other gender issues because women would finally be faced with certain uncomfortable truths about their gender of which full culpability and responsibility would be part of the discourse also men would be permitted to do something that does not presently occur defend our gender and put forth a perspective closer to our lived experienceswhich would completely debunk 99 of the determinants espoused by feminist to characterize men and mens feelings beliefs and expressions a real discussion a fair discussion would reveal one invariable truth about feminists they know nothing about men and what they think they know is aligned with a cartoon character of men an oversimplified caricature of men they use as the standard to stand in for men in general so while men are exposed day by day hour by hour to the womans perspective in media articles and beat over the head moment by moment with womens views ideas feelings wants whims and desires so much is dedicated to womens voices the reality is most women know very little about men beyond the caricature and cartoon presented in the main by the media and literature oh they know some things about men but only to the extent of what men are permitted to express within a society that increasingly punishes men for any expression that may be interpreted as critical of women regardless of context mgtow is in a sense the only logical rational option left for men who no longer believe their value should lay in the hands of women who require irrational selfsacrifice and subordinating our own worth to elevate the selfworth of women notice how when women tell other women to keep their money exploit mens emotions and manipulate mens to take advantage of us and not marry and not have relationships with men and how that makes them strong and independent and how they are role models for not needing to rely or need a man you dont hear a peep from other women telling them they are wrong about men and that they shouldnt manipulate mens emotions yet the moment a group of men decide to opt out of relationships with women to better their lives women automatically call them weak childish immature bitter intimidated by strong women selfish infantile a loser etc', 'all you need to know whatever your gender is that marriage is just another legally binding contract hence you must think twice and be very wary of signing the relevant document all the romantic mush it is dressed up in to hide its true nature ie a hard legally binding contract that favours women needs to be stripped away before you sign it think logically rationally about it you can get all the romantic sexual stuff even kids without marrying herhim no need to buy a cow just to get a pint of milk and there is a slightly more offensive feminist version of this that applies to buying a man which is best not repeated here honestly how can you possibly expect 2 people even in a perfect marriage to remain perfectly compatible and unchanged several years into the marriage people develop ie change over time and when that happens they may no longer be compatible nobody is to blame they just developed in different directions but the female still gets to sue for divorce and take all a mans wealth his kids home even destroy his reputation to ensure no other woman will ever want him i think marriage and commitment even a wedding etc nice traditions but in need of updating eg marriage contracts should only be for 5 year periods with option to quit or renew the contract prenups should be obligatory not merely optional and at the start of every serious engagement to be married before any jewellery goes on any fingers there needs to be official proof eg witnessed in a lawyers office signed documents etc to agree on how the relationship is to be ended if the impending marriage fails and cannot last the 5 year contract period eg who gets the kids the family home shared assets etc what each partner can or cannot do eg destroy the others reputation through malicious rumour etc to the press if they are people whose livelihood relies on being in the public eye very boring and unromantic but once that part is settled the couple can focus on all the usual romantic and sexual stuff baby production home maki g etc marriage involves traditional arranged marriages typically last so well precisely because they do a version of this ie strip all the romantic stuff away and treat it as a plain serious contract most of these societies tell young couples to forget about love and romance because it is irrelevant before the actual co tract sign ceremony just worry about getting the important stuff right eg property etc issues there are many years to be romantic after the contract is signed not before though makes perfect practical sense couples dare not break rules eg to fool around with other partners because the consequences for either gender are often very severe eg you could end up killed by your spouses family in an honour revenge killing so it serves to keep society in order harsh as it may be australian marriage laws traditions etc are so slack they render the entire institution not only meaningless and irrelevant but actually dangerous especially as feminists exploit marriage as a get rich quick scheme yet people feel a need to commit to one they love so it will never vanish which is why the marriage and all family law rules need to be revised and made more relevant to the reality of current society and fairer to men who are currently being so ruined and exploited by unscrupuless women through the family law system unless this happens the rate of violence against women is unlikely to reduce only get worse as it keeps generating increased stress and pressure on men whose typical hormonal response is the male aggression one they cannot always control if pushed too far by women eg in a legal custody or similar divorce battle the rate of female murders by men stands at one a week and rising women can do something about this tragic statistic get rid of the feminists and help save the lives of female future victims of such violence by doing so men seldom just kill for the fun of it all unless they are the rare psychopathic type of man they will have something motivating such extreme violence against women it is simply a hatred of women that develop through experience with them in many areas of life over time men are not born as woman haters have you ever seen a baby boy who hates or does not love his mother they are all born loving women but the way women treat them changes their attitude and makes them hate women enough to find the necessary energy strength i genuity etc needed to entrap and kill a woman which is quite a major exhausting job if you consider what is involved in trappi g her keeping her silenced carting her around chopping up her body or whatever the guys do not to mention the risks they take to murder a woman not that easy they would have to really hate women so much to be able to carry out such violent fears and they hate women because women as a gender have betrayed their faith and trust once the guys reach this extreme point of no return they will random kill any woman they dont are who any easy trapped victim will do because they are not seeki g reve ge on just one woman they are using their hapless random victim as a symbol of their revenge on the entire female gender that wronged them particularly feminists so if you are one you are in a sense partly guilty for the murder of other unfortunate often innocent but exposed vulnerable females if you really cared about other women not just your own selfish feminist selves you would put your money where your mouth is and change the way you treat men eg stop exploiting and degrading them as men to the point where they feel so desperate they kill women because they have no reason left to live for that means you give up your careers etc so they can have a job you dont grab all the political and other high status roles etc and you just learn to shut up and do as youre told whinge less make do with less and be grateful for it hardly rocket science for all your smart uni educated feminists to be able to grasp of course that presupposes you have a brain at all and didnt just get into uni and get a degree by buying it with money and influence ie corruption which is another discussion for another day', 'tvbridge marriage is the union of a man and a woman by god the two become one both have a responsibility to work on the marriage daily im not from the usa so things might be different there but i believe in biblical marriage ive only been married for 15 years so im still in the honeymoon stage but in my circle of friends and family all the older people have been happily married for 30 years my husbands great grandparents both made it till their 80th anniversary and had i got married younger thats what i would aspire to do i dont understand the negativity around marriage it is one of the most fulfilling experiences in life and the best environment to raise children people just need to understand that love is a decision not a feeling and both partners have to put 100 effort into it but its more rewarding than you can imagine my husband is the most wonderful person on the planet maybe not to everyone but to me i would do anything for him and he would do anything for me i just cant understand your view point it seems so twisted and ugly no wonder people are getting divorced if thats how they see marriage']",

The user also questions the authenticity of feminist women, sculpting a narrative that these women demand resources while claiming independence.\n\nOn a more general note, the user initially advocates against seeking relationship advice from women and emphasizes the uniqueness and diversity of individuals when it comes to personal perceptions and preferences. The user also questions the wisdom of promoting against marriage while endorsing it, showing a certain degree of confusion and criticism towards the broader societal attitudes and advice towards marriage.\n\nLastly, the user references a quote from Martin Luther King Jr., suggesting that married men may choose to die before their wives, implying a sense of freedom or relief, although the context of this statement is somewhat unclear."

Overall, the comments indicate a desire for an earnest, respectful examination of the challenges and importance of marriage."

Some users found it humorous that the speaker related to Jenny McCarthy. The main sentiment in the comments, however, revolves around dissatisfaction with the content of the talk. User's felt that the talk was too long, and the main point was oversimplified: if a woman gets married, she can gain numerous benefits, but there is nothing of value in getting married for a man. Some users went further to compare marriage to a hand grenade, suggesting that it's a risky endeavor for men. Overall, the audience felt the talk was too brief and lacked a nuanced discussion on the topic of marriage."

This situation sparked a discussion about the unpredictability of long-term relationships and the stereotypes associated with body types.\n\nAnother user challenges the idea that there's a specific formula for successful marriages, pointing out examples of happy couples where one partner is thinner than the other. A third user reinforces the stereotype of one partner being overweight, attributing it to a lack of care for one's body, specifically referencing wives.\n\nLastly, one user humorously mentions a personal agreement with their spouse about maintaining a certain level of fitness, implying that it's a source of motivation. Overall, the conversation reveals a complex web of opinions and biases surrounding body image and its impact on relationships."
