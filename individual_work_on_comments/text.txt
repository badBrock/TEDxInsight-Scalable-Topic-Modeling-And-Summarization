so i did thats paris thats rio in each place, we built exhibitions with a story, and the story traveled you understand the full scope of the project thats london new york and today, they are with you in long beach all right, recently i started a public art project where i dont use my artwork anymore i use man ray, helen levitt, giacomelli, other peoples artwork it doesnt matter today if its your photo or not the importance is what you do with the images, the statement it makes where its pasted so for example, i pasted the photo of the minaret in switzerland a few weeks after they voted the law forbidding minarets in the country this image of three men wearing gas masks was taken in chernobyl originally, and i pasted it in southern italy, where the mafia sometimes bury the garbage under the ground in some ways, art can change the world art is not supposed to change the world, to change practical things, but to change perceptions art can change the way we see the world art can create an analogy actually the fact that art cannot change things makes it a neutral place for exchanges and discussions, and then enables you to change the world when i do my work, i have two kinds of reactions people say, oh, why dont you go in iraq or afghanistan they would be really useful or, how can we help i presume that you belong to the second category, and thats good, because for that project, im going to ask you to take the photos and paste them so now my wish is i wish for you to stand up for what you care about by participating in a global art project, and together well turn the world inside out and this starts right now yes, everyone in the room everyone watching i wanted that wish to actually start now so a subject youre passionate about, a person who you want to tell their story or even your own photos tell me what you stand for take the photos, the portraits, upload it ill give you all the details and ill send you back your poster join by groups and reveal things to the world the full data is on the website insideoutproject net that is launching today what we see changes who we are when we act together, the whole thing is much more than the sum of the parts so i hope that, together, well create something that the world will remember and this starts right now and depends on you thank you thank you so i asked the people what happened oh, that guy just moved when the roofs were covered, a woman said as a joke, now god can see me when you look at kibera now, they look back okay, india before i start that, just so you know, each time we go to a place, we dont have authorization, so we set up like commandos were a group of friends who arrive there, and we try to paste on the walls but there are places where you just cant paste on a wall in india it was just impossible to paste i heard culturally and because of the law, they would just arrest us at the first pasting so we decided to paste white, white on the walls so imagine white guys pasting white papers so people would come to us and ask us, hey, what are you up to oh, you know, were just doing art art of course, they were confused but you know how india has a lot of dust in the streets, and the more dust you would have going up in the air, on the white paper you can almost see, but there is this sticky part like when you reverse a sticker and then i pasted huge posters everywhere in the bourgeois area of paris with the name, age, even building number of these guys a year later, the exhibition was displayed in front of the city hall of paris and we go from thug images, whove been stolen and distorted by the media, whos now proudly taking over his own image thats where i realized the power of paper and glue so could art change the world a year later, i was listening to all the noise about the middle east conflict i mean, at that time, trust me, they were only referring to the israeli and palestinian conflict so with my friend marco, we decided to go there and see who are the real palestinians and who are the real israelis are they so different when we got there, we just went in the street, started talking with people everywhere, and we realized that things were a bit different from the rhetoric we heard in the media so we decided to take portraits of palestinians and israelis doing the same jobs taxidriver, lawyer, cooks asked them to make a face as a sign of commitment not a smile that really doesnt tell about who you are and what you feel they all accepted to be pasted next to the other i decided to paste in eight israeli and palestinian cities and on both sides of the wall we launched the biggest illegal art exhibition ever we called the project face 2 face the experts said, no way the people will not accept the army will shoot you, and hamas will kidnap you we said, okay, lets try and push as far as we can i love the way that people will ask me, how big will my photo be it will be as big as your house when we did the wall, we did the palestinian side i wanted them to feel that this art belongs to them then the next day, i held a meeting on the main square and some women came they were all linked to the three kids that got killed there was the mother, the grandmother, the best friend they all wanted to shout the story after that day, everyone in the favela gave me the green light i took more photos, and we started the project the drug lords were kind of worried about us filming in the place, so i told them, you know what im not interested in filming the violence and the weapons you see that enough in the media what i want to show is the incredible life and energy ive been seeing it around me the last few days so thats a really symbolic pasting, because thats the first one we did that you couldnt see from the city and thats where the three kids got arrested, and thats the grandmother of one of them and on that stairs, thats where the traffickers always stand and theres a lot of exchange of fire everyone there understood the project and i framed it with color so you would not confuse it with advertising i mean, the citys the best gallery i could imagine i would never have to make a book and then present it to a gallery and let them decide if my work was nice enough to show it to people i would control it directly with the public in the streets so thats paris i would change depending on the places i would go the title of the exhibition thats on the champselysees i was quite proud of that one because i was just 18
