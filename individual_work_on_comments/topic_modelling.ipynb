         "Amazing_ This is true. Sometimes things happen that arent positive but out of every negative thing that happens there is a seed of opportunity for growth and change. I am happy these people were able to put their differences aside and were able to do what's best for the child. I am going through something similar however i don't want to be enemies with the mother of my children. I will always love her and respect her for everything she gave me._ Powerful & Amazing_ I can‚Äôt take a guy with dreads and a Detroit hat on on a ted talk seriously at all sorry üëéüëéüëé_ How They Both Move Close To Each-other As They Talk ü•∫_ Now these are 2 beautiful grown black adults...not Cardi B and Offset lol_ Thank you._ I think it's so wonderful how they are speaking to an audience but really to each other. So it's genuine. And it makes their message so relatable_ Parents need to watch this._ Two min in and I‚Äôm wishing all women would think this way. 50 50 parenting support... I‚Äôll stop there or I‚Äôll rant...üòñ_ Beautiful_ üòÖthat‚Äôs a gorgeous woman. We‚Äôd have to just work that out lort! Lol_ „Ö†_ Who else fell in love with this family's hair_ 'good job baby'_ That was very inspiring and agreed with a lot they said. But didnt agree that you just let a child do exactly what they want when they want. The supermarket being a strong point, I just didn't agree with this statement. Is it ok to let your child still eat with their hands like an animal so they couldn't use a fork when their older. Theres elements where you cant just let a child do what they want when they want. The supermarket comment I found very strange. Your educating you're child how to behave in society et cetera. Just struggled with that statement. If that's her view on a supermarket then apply that to everything else in life. Just doesn't work that way._ This is truly beautiful and a lot of take homes for someone raising a Queen just embarking on this co-parenting journey. I can, and will do better. Thank you x_ My son‚Äôs father and I had an on again off again abusive relationship. It was difficult, to say the least, when we split up after 6.5 years. In a lot of ways I still have love for him, but we were always better friends than we were in a relationship. It does make our current relationships hard at times. But, as we tell our son, the one thing we all agree on is that we love our little boy. Our son has four parents & doesn‚Äôt have any memory of what it was like before. For him, it‚Äôs always been that way & always will be. We get looks & comments all the time from people who don‚Äôt understand how we co-parent. We even call each other mom & dad in public. A child can never have too many people who love him. During my pregnancy that‚Äôs what I wished for; ‚ÄúI want him to have more love, more friends & family, than he knows what to do with.‚Äù This wasn‚Äôt the future we had imagined while waiting for our baby to arrive, but for as long as we keep love in our hearts, so shall it be._ You make so much as a parent only by not talking bad about the other parent with your kid. My parents can have opinions about each other and that affects my perception very much, but luckily they never trashed each other, because that must feel like you can't count on your parents or as if you had no one to trust._ Why do they...both talk like this...where they pause...at unnatural spots?_ My ex isn‚Äôt about equality... I digress... üò´_ i totally agree with your comment. If they let the kid be free spirit at anything, why do they pick clothes for him for school etc. ? you can't just let kid running in mall, first of all child can be abducted by predator, second it can cause harm to someone in the shop or himself. I can't remember the movie or tv series, but there was this kid that parents let him do whatever he wants to do because he's a free spirit and it turned out to be a little spoiled brat that no one liked. And this mantra they gave at the end? like whaaat? You know a lie repeated 100 times becomes a true? If he repeats himself or parents tell him that he's awesome, smart, genius, uberhuman, he's gonna start to believe it and think that he already is the greatest so he doesn't need to achieve anything more in life.... sad, but i hope the boy will achieve great things in life, not repeating his parents mistakes and having a straight thinking._ Why are we quiet in supermarkets? It is not a library where people need silence to focus. So, why do we have to be quiet in supermarkets? Because everyone does it, so we should all do it? Have you been to an Asian market? It is teeming with hustle and bustle and chaos. Fully grown adults are screaming, haggling, laughing, running, bumping into each other. Is this behavior strange? Is this behavior wrong? So, why should we teach a child that it is wrong to express themselves? There is something to be learned about respect, this is true. But maybe the child will learn to respect people in other ways in their life, and not from a scolding in a supermarket._ @scalpel¬† I dont disagree but with limits. A child bounding about in a supermarket as she allows could do serious harm to a little toddler or an elderly person. Let alone heavy products in the aisles that could fall and crush them. She almost had me but then it almost felt like lazy parenting._ They are giving a speech. You need to pause at certain times to give a speech._ @Ty-iz9wd¬† \nNot...the way....they do it._ This is exactly what I told my ex I wanted if we ever split. He was never mature enough to handle something like this. Our daughter is now 24 and I always wonder how different her life would have been had we coparented like this_ Low key teared up when they did the affirmations. Black excellence personified_ I‚Äôm not crying. You‚Äôre crying. The ending is beautiful!_ I admire both of you. You‚Äôre a good example for being a good parents. Lovely watching and listening your video from the top of Italian mountain._ Awesome !_ I repeated so many times, your wrong way, your own grapes, your own food.\nI choose my apprentices in my own way which has nothing to do with you blacks apparently since you can't be reasonable by \"book\" wrote by myself. There is no \"co\" can be done. Can't it be more obvious?_ Wow!!!!!_ Thus the present generation has been produced\nIs anyone surprised_ That was so beautiful! Thank you TED!_ \"We honor each other's role in Sekyu's life\" \n\nI love that statement. Respect comes before love, always. Blessings to this family._ This is incredibly helpful for people who suffer from co-parenting_ That's the magic power of our kids that can change ourselves .. only in front of this power you can endure anything and give up all your needs ..!_ These parents set an amazing example of not just co-parenting, but on being a good parent in generalüíñüòäamazing talk_ The world does not dispise black joy.._ Respect and sympathy are the keys for building a better relationship._ Wow, delete my comment, you disappoint me as well.\nFirst, don't waste your time, of course, others. Your magic only works on \"the animal level\", which is like humans could be grown like Tarzan as well.\nMoreover, when it comes to adversaries or allies, blacks asked national reparation for slavery while ignoring their ancient ancestors were alpha males who dominated the entire land of Africa, which was the reason why others walked out of Africa by risking their lives and built their homes on other continents and became other \"races\".\nSecond, I never said your magic works. How could I/anybody make anything based on a wrong/false thing? See, you have no clear thought of what you are doing and what others' saying. Not to mention that nobody has the responsibility to meet your expectation. Let alone, your expectation was only a one-sided imagination that only exists in your dream.\nThird, easy come easy go, your laziness, fluke mind and to speculate advantage by trickery can only waste your time. Stealing others' results doesn't mean you really gain what you stole, let alone what you stole has nothing to do with the thing you wanted.\nForth, you have no clear thought about what you are doing which isn't a problem can be fixed by one or two magics. The hard way is the only way. Roman was not built in one day._ It's so good to see that there are others with the same mindset. \nThis is the message I preach to the father of my sons but he does not have the ability as yet to look beyond that which he knows and the unfamiliarity of my concept to his person causes me to wonder if he is resilient to see things differently.  \nMy heart is firmed in the belief that making changes, makes the difference.  üëèüèøüëèüèøüëèüèø_ Beautiful!_ Love this ._ They should have avoided divorce._ Can't it be more obvious than your incoherent post? Yes._ Disagree._ üéºAbsolutely BEAUTIFULüíïüôèüèΩ_ Nice_ Now, this is a worthwhile TED Talk. I can appreciate their honesty, openness in public and desire to love their child more than they evidently could one another (although it sounds like they truly share a common love). Personally, I think It a shame that for whatever reason (none of our business what it is) they cannot be a \"typical\" family. However, they stand as a positive example for parents in the 21st century that share the marriage and parenting experience of Ebony Roberts and Shaka Senghor. May God bless and guide them and their son all together._ TED Talks are not as good as they used to be ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è_ TED wouldn't it be lovely if we got to see the boy as a teen, young adult and as a father as well?_ Black love on display, Amazing for the world to see. These parents are a role model for the world. Together in spirit for the child they created, even tho not together as lovers. I can't say enough about how this moved me. Thank you for allowing us on the magic!_ I left the house üè† with out my charger cord or adult pampers some body üôÉ please help if this phone doesn't stay charged üòë_ Thank you for being brave enough to be authentic. Your example as two individuals United is beautiful. He is a very fortunate little boy.\nBe Safe. üò∑ \nPeace. üé∂_ Amazing! Thankful to the wonderful parents for sharing their story. I hope and pray people in these situations benefit from this Ted Talk. This young king will benefit greatly because his patents have chosen to put him first!_ You sound so sweet, awesome.. üòú\nJust give them the aspirations in full swing.... üòç\nLove is passion\nLove is kind\nLove always protects........ \nLove always saves........_ Yeah very crucial video for today's generation of parents..very informative...thumps up..\n#Enlightened Beings_ Accepted_ Address the abuse . U address the problem_ Yes u do ....it's time to see jessie_ You are beautiful. What a beautiful üíì writer_ A child cannot have too many people who love them. The best environment a child can have is parents who respect each other. And not to forget that a child learns more from what the parents are than what they teach üññ_ Yes preach it_ Surely 'co-parenting' means parenting._ Excellent message and talk. Comes across very genuine. Thank you._ Beast Mode is just there so he won‚Äôt get fined._ Idk this talk is dilute, watery weak, with clear reading-off-script errors. The race politics thrown in like \"a world against black joy\" is also Ludacris. TED needs higher quality material instead of these soapy opera-ey filler talks._ from the talk: \"raising a black boy in a society that despises black joy....... blacks only seen has profitable or disposable\"\n\nI can't believe TED allowed a talk with such blatant spin on the modern world.\n\nOccasionally you get a good scientific one but lately it's been neo liberal postmodern diatribes by yuppies or racist minorities_ @ChurchOfThought¬† indeed, that is the part I didn't like. If they'd left that out it would've been great._ So he will learn murder is cool?_ ODW: I understand what you mean. I agree... the best we can do as parents is guide our children to have the greatest understanding of what is right in their own hearts. To nurture that innocent heart at the center of the child‚Äôs being... to give them the clearest understanding of the world we ourselves created as a community of people among people... to remain strong-spirited in the crowd of naysayers. Children are innocent and will go astray without a well defined path for them to choose as they form and reach for their goals._ I could see him itchin for skittles the whole speech_ Yall powerful i appreciate yall_ Had to be black people?_ I wonder if either of them moved on relationship wise or even remarried and how that affected things... I'd like to hear more._ Be mother without control!???? I want to see her when the boy be a teen_ It's so cute how they all have dreds yall.üò≠_ Why couldn‚Äôt I have had these two for my parents. Absolutely amazing_ üíñüíñüíñ_ I would have loved to co-parent with my ex-wife unfortunately the b** did me dirty in the divorce, and somehow got it to where I couldn't have my daughter for visitation until she could talk when she was 4 years old so she could say what was wrong with her.  Like me, my mother, and my grandmother had no clue on how to raise a child. After that relationship was broken it never mended. My daughter will be 23 this year and I haven't actually talked to her since she was 15. Her mother convinced her I only wanted her when it was convenient and she hasn't matured enough to realize how much bullshit her mother fed her. however she had no problem calling me in February and asking for $4,000 so she could move to Connecticut, with her younger sister._ https://youtu.be/mCYFxt_9aco_ PRICELESS. As this example takes hold in the hearts and minds of the many, the World will be changed. Thank you!_ This is so powerful!_ What wisdom they have shared! \n\nThank you!_ ‚ù§_ Wach my videos,they will put a smile_ Yeet_ Goosebumps throughout this whole speech üò≠üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è_ Luckily her mom didn't die -)\n\n\nlike if you feel bad for Shaka as a kid ;)_ Hi_ Thanks for liking my commentüòä\nHave a wonderful day!!_ Detroit. 10 minutes away from 14 and mound_ YES._ Gwendolyn Williams¬† \nIt is refreshing to see a black family with a mother and a father, despite them not being married. In my life and the lives of those that I know, such a trait is a *rarity*._ Ana Sylvia Hoppenbrouwers¬† ???_ I've just made my comment with kinda summaries that angle._ Yes super cute how the murderer's son dressed just like his dad._ Dreds are unhygienic. Cute but nasty üò∑_ Gwendolyn Williams¬† I haven't committed any crimes. I don't really understand your sentence, could you please use correct grammar?_ @The_Stocc¬† Lol you think you are going to win an argument on YouTube through pedantry. NOW that's cute! üò∫_ @ChurchOfThought¬†No, I genuinely don't understand it. I don't want to assume what it means._ Church Of Thought thats a common misconception (or maybe yours or those your around are like that) cuz most ppl with locs take care of them ü§∑üèΩ_ The guy needs a haircut ASAP._ Love them who you have ,all that matters is love._ Because they're doing this for clout. 100% guarantee they don't actually do the positive things they claim._ Anoop Dubey has to work on a_ This is so powerful .._ Felt like watching a Dr. Phil episode..._ 3 likes 0 views? ü§î_ Early_ Just amazing!_ First_ One of the Best speech I've ever heard! üá∫üáøüá∫üáøüá∫üáøüá∫üáø_ Wow sir_ Hi first_ It's the way they're counted and validated by the system... happens often on low view counts_ Youtube has been around for decades and folk like you still think you've found something profound because you CBF doing homework about how the two stats are incremented?_ The best_ She's bomb.

         "Bravo!_ A successful mindset isn't something that you simply attempt to follow for each day, it requires a continuing series of thoughts, that are selfless. When it involves success, regardless of what your definition of success can be, having positive thoughts may be a must.\r\n\r\nA positive line of thought is one amongst the key factors that differentiate a successful person from the one who isn't ready to achieve their definition of success. it's said that thoughts precede actions. So, if you're surrounded by negative thoughts, your actions will have slightly of negativity to them. And with negativity, you'll never succeed._ Happily we are more and more spread all over the world, sharing such a proactive attitude ! Maybe two more elements : we could also find another encouraging example in the XVIe century. The humanity then was also confronted some really terrific threats. Result ? One of the most brillant period of the humanity known by the histoy as Rebirth ! Second element, and another main challenge : the drastic and actually not correctly managed mutation of the communication channels and speedness that  for the being escapes the essential qualitative filter of a democratic (i.e. pluralist) press. We have also to reinvent an efficient democratic press able to spread through the social network hope and positif attitude ! Cause without hope and positive mind, how could we expect a right entrepreneurship for initiating a second Rebirth... i.e. referring to the  immemorial myth of the Phoenix !_ Boycott animal agriculture, the leading cause of environmental destruction! Let's replace the egotistical anthropocentric worldview for ecocentric worldview where nature and everyone in it has a value of their own and not just as a resource to exploit! ‚ù§Ô∏èüçÉ_ Wonderful talk, powerful message BUT 3:40 is wrong from so many fronts and it's sad to hear it from someone working for the UN when the inequalities are not reduced but exacerbated: \"Will Russia wreck the negotiations, will China take the responsibilities for their emissions, will the US help the 'poorer' countries deal with their burden of climate change.\" Portraying Russia as evil, China as the one responsible for the emissions, and the US as the saver of the world is so cilche and so HARMFUL. Will the US take responsibility for its factories in China? Will it take responsibility for its own emissions before criticizing others (it's the second emitter of CO2 in the world)? I love the US and I believe in the potential of the UN but, please, stop dividing the world on 'good' and 'bad' and stop putting all the responsibilities on others. Let's be a bit more critical of ourselves and inclusive of others. And not the opposite. Afterall, that's where you truly approach the issue with love - by empowering and being ready to learn the opinion of others, and that's where the real change begins._ Hahah yes, China and Russia are the bad guys for their CO2 emissions, but the main question when it comes to the US is whether it can help the poorer countries with their emissions.\nNice choice of words, you biased figs.\n\nAny TED talk that starts with a story about UN is a TED talk you should avoid._ US and the western word should take more responsibility on climate change, even your production are done in overseas, you are the consumers.

United Nation is a Joke !! this is an other fact !! If you need proofs i will give you_ It‚Äôs weird seeing a face attached to his voice after listening to him on Outrage & Optimism podcast._ I love the \"stubborn optimism\" idea.

Gramsci talked about \"Pessimism of the mind and Optimism of the will.\" A friend of mine has this quote from Vaclav Havel on all her emails \"Hope is an orientation of the spirit an orientation of the heart. Hope, is an ability to work for something because it is good, not just because it stands a chance to succeed.\" Jonathan Lear has a great book on this called Radical Hope._ I LOOOOOVE TED_ Energizing and motivational talk\n\nThank you_ Thank you for convincing me to get up.

Terrible as a video. Too many Blairish hand gestures. Too many!_ We can no longer afford the luxury of feeling powerless üëèüí™üåé_ This will be back in history books_ Or the channel deletes them._ Exactly_ Yeah, we germans tried the determined, stubborn optimism, about 80 years ago. Everybody wanted to restore germany after the great war and worked to heal themselfes and the world just with iron will and diszipline. Long story, but it didn't turn out very well, just like this speech._ I'm actually liking this TED format! Beautiful talk!üëå_ Great how to video, definately giving me ideas for videos on my channel ! \n\nThank you for motivation :D_ Great talk but I wish he'd move his hands more üëÄ_ #xr_ Fabulous_ Loved your talk.. can't explain how much I needed to hear that._ Someone edit a barbell or gavel in his hands._ The UN is the future as globalization continues rapidly, but there will be a time in the future when \"the people\" will turn on the UN as a \"One World Government,\" and oppose them. The conspiracy theorists who oppose any rule of power and law will always try and undermine any good being done with a sceptical eye. Simply put, the idea of a small room of people dictating all of the world's big choices, will become the establishment to dismantle._ so...at the end, The Beatles were right...._ The best one I heard from his talk was \"it's scary now but let's approach it with love.\"_ Very weird hand movement. His words do not connect to the hand movement.\n = He is not telling honestly, because his body movement is telling otherwise._ i originally thought this was gonna be a ted talk on ‚Äúthe law of attraction‚Äù lol_ \"Is it really true that humans will only take sustained and dedicated action on an issue of paramount importance, when they feel they have a high degree of control?\" No, this is not true! Humans will only take sustained and dedicated action on an issue of paramount importance if and only if they feel the pain - given that taking action involves a reduction or delay of immediate gratification. Our brains are based on locally optimal optimization not global one, although the later is theoretically possible, it must usually be enforced by pain and extreme fear._ Nothing is going to change unless we all admit to ourselves, the real problem is capitalism._ I thought this talk was brilliant_ The problem is that organizations like UN WHO are totally corrupt, economically and politically. Bad actors like CCP controlled China are clearly not on the par for humanity other than coercion and bribery._ I understood your works‚ù§_ —Ç–≤–æ—é –∂ –¥–∏–≤–∏–∑–∏—é, –∞ –º–Ω–µ —á–µ –¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å_ Thank you for your concern,As a Bangladeshi climate crisis is now every day issue and touching every one in minimum or maximum  way like unwanted heavy rain in Dhaka, heat, sudden flood in river side or heavy storm in coastal area..........._ GRITTIER, DETERMINED, REALISTIC, STUBBORN OPTIMISM üî•\n\n\"we now need to move beyond this narrative of powerlessness.\" üëè\n\n\"we can no longer afford the luxury of being powerless.\" üëè_ I wish I wouldn't have read this comment before watching the video.

Unfortunately, he's gone over-the-top and is forcing himself to wave his arms around hoping to emphasise what he's saying. üññ_ @quAdxify: Thank you for providing this example of the mindset we are offered to shift away from. Not untrue, but only significant if you believe mind-change (and the attendant changes to the underlying neural network) are not possible. I, for one, have experience that such change is possible._ None of that is due to climate change._ The best so far_ 3 Ways To Future-Proof Your Career : \nInvest in yourself.\n\nContinuously learning and developing keeps you both at the top of your game now and in the right mindset to adapt to change in the future. By making learning part of your routine, it will become a habit and your brain will become used to consistently taking in new information. This way, when a big change happens, you‚Äôll be ready to learn what you need to do to stay ahead of the curve.\n\nTake the time to learn new skills that will help now as well as in the future. Stay on top of new innovations in your industry. Keep a pulse on what‚Äôs going on internally at your company. Think about where you‚Äôd like to be in the next five years in terms of job title, position, and company you‚Äôre working for. From there, figure out the most important skills related to those jobs or positions, and make that your priority for learning. Being aware of what can come next and staying open to options will set you up for future success.\n\nYou don‚Äôt have to go back to school to learn. In fact, learning as you‚Äôre working is usually a far more effective method. You‚Äôll be able to stay current in your industry and learn specifically what you need, rather than following a rigid set curriculum. If your company offers education as part of your development, take full advantage of it.  If you plan to make a drastic career change, that‚Äôs when formal schooling could be beneficial.\n\nCreate the job you want to do.\n\nJob titles and roles are changing, and you have the power to use this to your advantage. If you‚Äôre not feeling satisfied or fulfilled in your current role but there isn‚Äôt another role available, create one. This is a particularly useful way of gaining more knowledge and developing your skillset without having to leave your company.\n\nWhen you‚Äôre pitching an idea for a new position, make sure to be detailed in your explanation. Explain the responsibilities of the new position, how it relates to your current role, why it would be beneficial to the company, and of course why you‚Äôre the right person for the job. Be prepared to answer any questions that you‚Äôre asked, and always frame answers by highlighting the value it adds to the company.\n\nNot all companies will be amenable to this, but it‚Äôs always worth having a conversation with your manager to see if it‚Äôs a possibility. If nothing else, it shows them that you‚Äôre serious about development, and can put you on their radar for the next opportunity that opens up. You can also use this as an opportunity to transition into a conversation about ways to take on more responsibility, or even set yourself up for a promotion.\n\nPut down your phone.\n\nThere‚Äôs a whole world outside of your phone. Too often, we use our phones as a defense mechanism. In an uncomfortable situation? Pull out your phone. Don‚Äôt want to talk to someone? Pull out your phone. It‚Äôs easy to hide behind a screen, but it‚Äôs far more effective to put it down every once and a while. It‚Äôs even changed the way we communicate. We spend so much time on our phones for work that we get too accustomed to texting and typing rather than having conversations with people in person.\n\n\nRather than spending all of your time focused on digital ways of connecting with people, mix things up a bit. Make it a goal to have a five minute conversation with someone each day. Go to a networking event after work or happy hour with your colleagues. Networking events are a great way to help you step out of your comfort zone and practice face to face communication. You‚Äôre able to meet new people and learn about what they‚Äôre doing. It might even spark an idea for you to explore.\n\nThere‚Äôs no way of telling exactly what the future of work will look like, so it‚Äôs important to keep a pulse on your industry. By preparing yourself now, both by learning and putting yourself into the right mindset, you‚Äôll be able to take the changes in stride and be ready for anything that comes your way._ Uhh sir, this is a Wendy‚Äôs._ Lockdown was the most useless and idiotic move ever causing more damage than good.

Actually he should write poetry    But to me the UN is a corrupt organization run by the US.  And until it gets out of the grip of the US it's not going to do any good.  It's not a fair representation of the world.  Sorry that's how I feel about it and I'm an American.  Okay now you lost me once I saw that picture of Mahatma Gandhi.  When are people going to learn to think for themselves that man was a child rapist and a molester he does not deserve to be on anybody's high list of greatest people on earth.

LOL Right now I'm enjoying this more as I hear words spouted I've basically heard for 50 years. I think I'll copy this as my main comment.

But have you tried looking at any of Hans Rosling's work? It might keep you from getting depressed._ It seems that way only because we haven't actually reached the Apex of humanity.

We are still unawake to the need to work with universal law instead of for our selfish gain. \n\nI believe this is also the message being conveyed in this video. It does seem like we've overpopulated the planet, but that's only because we haven't learned yet to work with nature and harnessing it through technology._ Andrew Kline Idk I found him engaging and insightful- I think he did a good job keeping the audience‚Äôs attention (in my opinion), because of the purposeful way he spoke and how he emphasized the importance of particular issues and ideas with his body. \n\nThe topic was about shifting one‚Äôs mindset, and he didn‚Äôt say what steps you‚Äôd have to take to get there, but he actively shifted mine into a more optimistic point of view like, ‚Äúno matter if we win or lose the battle I‚Äôll try my best and do my part because I believe in what humanity COULD be- and I believe in good.‚Äù I liked the fact that he was in the woods too, it made the setting more peaceful and enjoyable to look at._ I feel like ted talks should include their personal ideology.

Your attention wanders when things don't make sense, am I right? And many things you have been led to believe don't make sense because they are lies. The social disconnection you feel isn't a reflection of you. It's a symptom of being awake in a sleeping world.

I love your oxygen mask analogy, I can totally relate!_ Since taking office, President Biden has distanced himself from the previous administration by¬†highlighting racial equity, including in his approach to appointing agency officials and a new Supreme Court justice.\n\nWhile representation is a critical component of racial equity, deep systems change is necessary to achieve meaningful transformation. Biden‚Äôs approach has notably failed to address the systemic racism inherent in our immigration system, which his administration has weaponized to expel Black people seeking safety in the U.S.\n\nAmerica‚Äôs immigration system was designed, from its inception, to keep Black immigrants out. Today‚Äôs immigration system‚Äîstarting with the asylum process and detention centers and ending in immigration courtrooms‚Äîcontinues to make use of historical mechanisms for denying Black people entry to this country.\n\nOver¬†147¬†countries, including the U.S., recognize the right to asylum, which guarantees protection to those fleeing persecution on account of their race, religion, nationality, or other protected grounds. But to obtain asylum, a person must first reach a U.S. border‚Äîa notorious site of racialized inclusion and exclusion.\n\nThis foundational requirement‚Äîthat a person physically knock on America‚Äôs door‚Äîwas the first ‚Äúline of defense‚Äù the U.S. used to keep Black migrants out. In the 1980s, the U.S. deployed the Coast Guard to block 23,000 Haitians fleeing Jean-Claude Duvalier‚Äôs repressive regime from reaching our borders. Of those¬†23,000¬†people, eight were granted asylum.\n\nIn the 1990s, the U.S. again intercepted Haitian refugees. Of those 37,000 people, just 300‚Äîless than 1%‚Äîwere granted asylum. After campaign promises of more compassionate immigration policies, President Biden forcibly expelled at least¬†10,000 Haitians¬†from our¬†Southern border¬†without due process; none were permitted to seek asylum.\n\nToday, the U.S. continues to create and support policies intended to deter and push back Black migrants, preventing them from touching U.S. soil through a system of racialized border exclusion. The Biden administration continues to employ a¬†deeply flawed and racist metering system, a legacy of the Trump administration that creates greater obstacles for Black migrants, requiring them to submit more documentation than others to be added to the list for entry.\n\nBlack migrants suffer from disparate credibility findings during credible-fear and reasonable-fear proceedings, and blanket denials for humanitarian parole and Title 42 exemptions. The problem is so entrenched that a hundred Democratic legislators from both Congressional houses have submitted a¬†letter¬†to President Biden voicing concerns about the administration‚Äôs treatment of Black migrants.\n\nImmigration Detention Policies Are Oppressive\n\nImmigration detention policies further oppress Black migrants. In the 1980s, our system of mass detention was created to keep Central Americans and Haitians out, giving rise to the criminalization of asylum and the modern system of immigration detention.\n\nIn the 1990s, the U.S. government held intercepted Haitian refugees in cages for a year at an ‚ÄúHIV prison camp‚Äù at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Now, Immigration and Customs Enforcement detains approximately¬†20,000¬†immigrants each day in a vast network of federal detention centers, private prisons, state prisons, and jails.\n\nBecause police disproportionately arrest Black individuals, juries disproportionately convict them, and judges levy disproportionate sentences against them, Black immigrants are¬†disproportionately¬†funneled into immigrant detention. Not only are they detained for longer periods of time, they are¬†six times¬†more likely to be subjected to solitary confinement.\n\nAnd once Black immigrants enter immigration courtrooms, they face judges with crushing caseloads¬†and¬†about four hours¬†to make a life-or-death decision‚Äîthe precise conditions in which racial bias thrives. Implicit bias and institutional shortcomings inevitably impact how an immigration judge perceives an applicant‚Äôs credibility.\n\nBecause of bias and institutional racism, Black people historically have been perceived as dishonest and untrustworthy. So it is no surprise that immigration judges are more likely to find Black immigrants less credible than those of other races.\n\nFailed Policies Need Correction\n\nThere is much that this administration must do to correct the long history of failed immigration policy. First, Biden must push Congress to eliminate the harsh criminal bars to asylum‚Äîbars created in the late 1990s, which have steadily expanded since then. He must advocate for an end to detention of immigrants‚Äîespecially mandatory detention‚Äîwhich can result in the imprisonment of immigrants for years after they have served their criminal sentences.\n\nAnd to combat discrimination in immigration courts, he can require that immigration judges participate in increased anti-bias training; he can hire with greater racial diversity; and he can create work conditions conducive to thoughtful, merits-based decision-making‚Äînot ‚Äúrocket dockets‚Äù or expedited legal proceedings.\n\nRacist policies that restrict the movement of Black people and other people of color and subject asylum-seekers to mistreatment and detention while their legal claims are processed, disproportionately harm Black migrants. It is time to recognize these injustices and enact policies to prevent them.\n\nThis article does not necessarily reflect the opinion of The Bureau of National Affairs, Inc., the publisher of Bloomberg Law and Bloomberg Tax, or its owners.\n\nWrite for Us: Author Guidelines\n\nAuthor Information\n\nTsion Gurmu¬†is the legal manager of the Black Alliance for Just Immigration, the first national immigrant rights organization for people of African descent.

Anyway, I think the whole \"my family came here legally so yours should too\" misses the apples and oranges nature of the equation.

I am happy these people were able to put their differences aside and were able to do what's best for the child. I am going through something similar however i don't want to be enemies with the mother of my children.

So it's genuine. And it makes their message so relatable_ Parents need to watch this._ Two min in and I‚Äôm wishing all women would think this way. 50 50 parenting support... I‚Äôll stop there or I‚Äôll rant...üòñ_ Beautiful_ üòÖthat‚Äôs a gorgeous woman. We‚Äôd have to just work that out lort! Lol_ „Ö†_ Who else fell in love with this family's hair_ 'good job baby'_ That was very inspiring and agreed with a lot they said. But didnt agree that you just let a child do exactly what they want when they want. The supermarket being a strong point, I just didn't agree with this statement. Is it ok to let your child still eat with their hands like an animal so they couldn't use a fork when their older. Theres elements where you cant just let a child do what they want when they want. The supermarket comment I found very strange. Your educating you're child how to behave in society et cetera. Just struggled with that statement. If that's her view on a supermarket then apply that to everything else in life. Just doesn't work that way._ This is truly beautiful and a lot of take homes for someone raising a Queen just embarking on this co-parenting journey. I can, and will do better. Thank you x_ My son‚Äôs father and I had an on again off again abusive relationship. It was difficult, to say the least, when we split up after 6.5 years. In a lot of ways I still have love for him, but we were always better friends than we were in a relationship. It does make our current relationships hard at times. But, as we tell our son, the one thing we all agree on is that we love our little boy. Our son has four parents & doesn‚Äôt have any memory of what it was like before. For him, it‚Äôs always been that way & always will be. We get looks & comments all the time from people who don‚Äôt understand how we co-parent. We even call each other mom & dad in public. A child can never have too many people who love him. During my pregnancy that‚Äôs what I wished for; ‚ÄúI want him to have more love, more friends & family, than he knows what to do with.‚Äù This wasn‚Äôt the future we had imagined while waiting for our baby to arrive, but for as long as we keep love in our hearts, so shall it be._ You make so much as a parent only by not talking bad about the other parent with your kid. My parents can have opinions about each other and that affects my perception very much, but luckily they never trashed each other, because that must feel like you can't count on your parents or as if you had no one to trust._ Why do they...both talk like this...where they pause...at unnatural spots?_ My ex isn‚Äôt about equality... I digress... üò´_ i totally agree with your comment. If they let the kid be free spirit at anything, why do they pick clothes for him for school etc. ? you can't just let kid running in mall, first of all child can be abducted by predator, second it can cause harm to someone in the shop or himself. I can't remember the movie or tv series, but there was this kid that parents let him do whatever he wants to do because he's a free spirit and it turned out to be a little spoiled brat that no one liked. And this mantra they gave at the end? like whaaat? You know a lie repeated 100 times becomes a true? If he repeats himself or parents tell him that he's awesome, smart, genius, uberhuman, he's gonna start to believe it and think that he already is the greatest so he doesn't need to achieve anything more in life.... sad, but i hope the boy will achieve great things in life, not repeating his parents mistakes and having a straight thinking._ Why are we quiet in supermarkets? It is not a library where people need silence to focus. So, why do we have to be quiet in supermarkets? Because everyone does it, so we should all do it? Have you been to an Asian market? It is teeming with hustle and bustle and chaos. Fully grown adults are screaming, haggling, laughing, running, bumping into each other. Is this behavior strange? Is this behavior wrong? So, why should we teach a child that it is wrong to express themselves? There is something to be learned about respect, this is true. But maybe the child will learn to respect people in other ways in their life, and not from a scolding in a supermarket._ @scalpel¬† I dont disagree but with limits. A child bounding about in a supermarket as she allows could do serious harm to a little toddler or an elderly person. Let alone heavy products in the aisles that could fall and crush them. She almost had me but then it almost felt like lazy parenting._ They are giving a speech. You need to pause at certain times to give a speech._ @Ty-iz9wd¬† \nNot...the way....they do it._ This is exactly what I told my ex I wanted if we ever split. He was never mature enough to handle something like this. Our daughter is now 24 and I always wonder how different her life would have been had we coparented like this_ Low key teared up when they did the affirmations. Black excellence personified_ I‚Äôm not crying. You‚Äôre crying. The ending is beautiful!_ I admire both of you. You‚Äôre a good example for being a good parents. Lovely watching and listening your video from the top of Italian mountain._ Awesome !_ I repeated so many times, your wrong way, your own grapes, your own food.\nI choose my apprentices in my own way which has nothing to do with you blacks apparently since you can't be reasonable by \"book\" wrote by myself. There is no \"co\" can be done. Can't it be more obvious?_ Wow!!!!!_ Thus the present generation has been produced\nIs anyone surprised_ That was so beautiful! Thank you TED!_ \"We honor each other's role in Sekyu's life\" \n\nI love that statement. Respect comes before love, always. Blessings to this family._ This is incredibly helpful for people who suffer from co-parenting_ That's the magic power of our kids that can change ourselves .. only in front of this power you can endure anything and give up all your needs ..!_ These parents set an amazing example of not just co-parenting, but on being a good parent in generalüíñüòäamazing talk_ The world does not dispise black joy.._ Respect and sympathy are the keys for building a better relationship._ Wow, delete my comment, you disappoint me as well.\nFirst, don't waste your time, of course, others. Your magic only works on \"the animal level\", which is like humans could be grown like Tarzan as well.\nMoreover, when it comes to adversaries or allies, blacks asked national reparation for slavery while ignoring their ancient ancestors were alpha males who dominated the entire land of Africa, which was the reason why others walked out of Africa by risking their lives and built their homes on other continents and became other \"races\".\nSecond, I never said your magic works. How could I/anybody make anything based on a wrong/false thing? See, you have no clear thought of what you are doing and what others' saying. Not to mention that nobody has the responsibility to meet your expectation. Let alone, your expectation was only a one-sided imagination that only exists in your dream.\nThird, easy come easy go, your laziness, fluke mind and to speculate advantage by trickery can only waste your time. Stealing others' results doesn't mean you really gain what you stole, let alone what you stole has nothing to do with the thing you wanted.\nForth, you have no clear thought about what you are doing which isn't a problem can be fixed by one or two magics. The hard way is the only way. Roman was not built in one day._ It's so good to see that there are others with the same mindset. \nThis is the message I preach to the father of my sons but he does not have the ability as yet to look beyond that which he knows and the unfamiliarity of my concept to his person causes me to wonder if he is resilient to see things differently.  \nMy heart is firmed in the belief that making changes, makes the difference.  üëèüèøüëèüèøüëèüèø_ Beautiful!_ Love this ._ They should have avoided divorce._ Can't it be more obvious than your incoherent post? Yes._ Disagree._ üéºAbsolutely BEAUTIFULüíïüôèüèΩ_ Nice_ Now, this is a worthwhile TED Talk. I can appreciate their honesty, openness in public and desire to love their child more than they evidently could one another (although it sounds like they truly share a common love). Personally, I think It a shame that for whatever reason (none of our business what it is) they cannot be a \"typical\" family. However, they stand as a positive example for parents in the 21st century that share the marriage and parenting experience of Ebony Roberts and Shaka Senghor. May God bless and guide them and their son all together._ TED Talks are not as good as they used to be ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è_ TED wouldn't it be lovely if we got to see the boy as a teen, young adult and as a father as well?_ Black love on display, Amazing for the world to see. These parents are a role model for the world. Together in spirit for the child they created, even tho not together as lovers. I can't say enough about how this moved me. Thank you for allowing us on the magic!_ I left the house üè† with out my charger cord or adult pampers some body üôÉ please help if this phone doesn't stay charged üòë_ Thank you for being brave enough to be authentic. Your example as two individuals United is beautiful. He is a very fortunate little boy.\nBe Safe. üò∑ \nPeace. üé∂_ Amazing! Thankful to the wonderful parents for sharing their story. I hope and pray people in these situations benefit from this Ted Talk. This young king will benefit greatly because his patents have chosen to put him first!_ You sound so sweet, awesome.. üòú\nJust give them the aspirations in full swing.... üòç\nLove is passion\nLove is kind\nLove always protects........ \nLove always saves........_ Yeah very crucial video for today's generation of parents..very informative...thumps up..\n#Enlightened Beings_ Accepted_ Address the abuse . U address the problem_ Yes u do ....it's time to see jessie_ You are beautiful. What a beautiful üíì writer_ A child cannot have too many people who love them. The best environment a child can have is parents who respect each other. And not to forget that a child learns more from what the parents are than what they teach üññ_ Yes preach it_ Surely 'co-parenting' means parenting._ Excellent message and talk. Comes across very genuine. Thank you._ Beast Mode is just there so he won‚Äôt get fined._ Idk this talk is dilute, watery weak, with clear reading-off-script errors. The race politics thrown in like \"a world against black joy\" is also Ludacris. TED needs higher quality material instead of these soapy opera-ey filler talks._ from the talk: \"raising a black boy in a society that despises black joy....... blacks only seen has profitable or disposable\"\n\nI can't believe TED allowed a talk with such blatant spin on the modern world.\n\nOccasionally you get a good scientific one but lately it's been neo liberal postmodern diatribes by yuppies or racist minorities_ @ChurchOfThought¬† indeed, that is the part I didn't like. If they'd left that out it would've been great._ So he will learn murder is cool?_ ODW: I understand what you mean. I agree... the best we can do as parents is guide our children to have the greatest understanding of what is right in their own hearts. To nurture that innocent heart at the center of the child‚Äôs being... to give them the clearest understanding of the world we ourselves created as a community of people among people... to remain strong-spirited in the crowd of naysayers. Children are innocent and will go astray without a well defined path for them to choose as they form and reach for their goals._ I could see him itchin for skittles the whole speech_ Yall powerful i appreciate yall_ Had to be black people?_ I wonder if either of them moved on relationship wise or even remarried and how that affected things... I'd like to hear more._ Be mother without control!???? I want to see her when the boy be a teen_ It's so cute how they all have dreds yall.üò≠_ Why couldn‚Äôt I have had these two for my parents. Absolutely amazing_ üíñüíñüíñ_ I would have loved to co-parent with my ex-wife unfortunately the b** did me dirty in the divorce, and somehow got it to where I couldn't have my daughter for visitation until she could talk when she was 4 years old so she could say what was wrong with her.  Like me, my mother, and my grandmother had no clue on how to raise a child. After that relationship was broken it never mended. My daughter will be 23 this year and I haven't actually talked to her since she was 15. Her mother convinced her I only wanted her when it was convenient and she hasn't matured enough to realize how much bullshit her mother fed her. however she had no problem calling me in February and asking for $4,000 so she could move to Connecticut, with her younger sister._ https://youtu.be/mCYFxt_9aco_ PRICELESS. As this example takes hold in the hearts and minds of the many, the World will be changed. Thank you!_ This is so powerful!_ What wisdom they have shared! \n\nThank you!_ ‚ù§_ Wach my videos,they will put a smile_ Yeet_ Goosebumps throughout this whole speech üò≠üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è_ Luckily her mom didn't die -)\n\n\nlike if you feel bad for Shaka as a kid ;)_ Hi_ Thanks for liking my commentüòä\nHave a wonderful day!!_ Detroit. 10 minutes away from 14 and mound_ YES._ Gwendolyn Williams¬† \nIt is refreshing to see a black family with a mother and a father, despite them not being married. In my life and the lives of those that I know, such a trait is a *rarity*._ Ana Sylvia Hoppenbrouwers¬† ???_ I've just made my comment with kinda summaries that angle._ Yes super cute how the murderer's son dressed just like his dad._ Dreds are unhygienic. Cute but nasty üò∑_ Gwendolyn Williams¬† I haven't committed any crimes. I don't really understand your sentence, could you please use correct grammar?_ @The_Stocc¬† Lol you think you are going to win an argument on YouTube through pedantry. NOW that's cute! üò∫_ @ChurchOfThought¬†No, I genuinely don't understand it. I don't want to assume what it means._ Church Of Thought thats a common misconception (or maybe yours or those your around are like that) cuz most ppl with locs take care of them ü§∑üèΩ_ The guy needs a haircut ASAP._ Love them who you have ,all that matters is love._ Because they're doing this for clout. 100% guarantee they don't actually do the positive things they claim._ Anoop Dubey has to work on a_ This is so powerful .._ Felt like watching a Dr. Phil episode..._ 3 likes 0 views? ü§î_ Early_ Just amazing!_ First_ One of the Best speech I've ever heard! üá∫üáøüá∫üáøüá∫üáøüá∫üáø_ Wow sir_ Hi first_ It's the way they're counted and validated by the system... happens often on low view counts_ Youtube has been around for decades and folk like you still think you've found something profound because you CBF doing homework about how the two stats are incremented?_ The best_ She's bomb.

So, why should we teach a child that it is wrong to express themselves? There is something to be learned about respect, this is true.

The supermarket being a strong point, I just didn't agree with this statement. Is it ok to let your child still eat with their hands like an animal so they couldn't use a fork when their older. Theres elements where you cant just let a child do what they want when they want. The supermarket comment I found very strange. Your educating you're child how to behave in society et cetera. Just struggled with that statement. If that's her view on a supermarket then apply that to everything else in life. Just doesn't work that way."

In a lot of ways I still have love for him, but we were always better friends than we were in a relationship. It does make our current relationships hard at times. But, as we tell our son, the one thing we all agree on is that we love our little boy. Our son has four parents & doesn‚Äôt have any memory of what it was like before. For him, it‚Äôs always been that way & always will be. We get looks & comments all the time from people who don‚Äôt understand how we co-parent. We even call each other mom & dad in public. A child can never have too many people who love him. During my pregnancy that‚Äôs what I wished for; ‚ÄúI want him to have more love, more friends & family, than he knows what to do with.‚Äù This wasn‚Äôt the future we had imagined while waiting for our baby to arrive, but for as long as we keep love in our hearts, so shall it be."

If they let the kid be free spirit at anything, why do they pick clothes for him for school etc. ? you can't just let kid running in mall, first of all child can be abducted by predator, second it can cause harm to someone in the shop or himself. I can't remember the movie or tv series, but there was this kid that parents let him do whatever he wants to do because he's a free spirit and it turned out to be a little spoiled brat that no one liked. And this mantra they gave at the end? like whaaat? You know a lie repeated 100 times becomes a true? If he repeats himself or parents tell him that he's awesome, smart, genius, uberhuman, he's gonna start to believe it and think that he already is the greatest so he doesn't need to achieve anything more in life.... sad, but i hope the boy will achieve great things in life, not repeating his parents mistakes and having a straight thinking."

Have you been to an Asian market? It is teeming with hustle and bustle and chaos. Fully grown adults are screaming, haggling, laughing, running, bumping into each other. Is this behavior strange? Is this behavior wrong? So, why should we teach a child that it is wrong to express themselves? There is something to be learned about respect, this is true.

How could I/anybody make anything based on a wrong/false thing? See, you have no clear thought of what you are doing and what others' saying. Not to mention that nobody has the responsibility to meet your expectation. Let alone, your expectation was only a one-sided imagination that only exists in your dream.\nThird, easy come easy go, your laziness, fluke mind and to speculate advantage by trickery can only waste your time. Stealing others' results doesn't mean you really gain what you stole, let alone what you stole has nothing to do with the thing you wanted.\nForth, you have no clear thought about what you are doing which isn't a problem can be fixed by one or two magics.

And this mantra they gave at the end? like whaaat? You know a lie repeated 100 times becomes a true?

          "my sons father and i had an on again off again abusive relationship it was difficult to say the least when we split up after 65 years in a lot of ways i still have love for him but we were always better friends than we were in a relationship it does make our current relationships hard at times but as we tell our son the one thing we all agree on is that we love our little boy our son has four parents doesnt have any memory of what it was like before for him its always been that way always will be we get looks comments all the time from people who dont understand how we coparent we even call each other mom dad in public a child can never have too many people who love him during my pregnancy thats what i wished for i want him to have more love more friends family than he knows what to do with this wasnt the future we had imagined while waiting for our baby to arrive but for as long as we keep love in our hearts so shall it be",

          "i dont disagree but with limits a child bounding about in a supermarket as she allows could do serious harm to a little toddler or an elderly person let alone heavy products in the aisles that could fall and crush them she almost had me but then it almost felt like lazy parenting",
          "love them who you have all that matters is love",
          "you make so much as a parent only by not talking bad about the other parent with your kid my parents can have opinions about each other and that affects my perception very much but luckily they never trashed each other because that must feel like you cant count on your parents or as if you had no one to trust",
          "i totally agree with your comment if they let the kid be free spirit at anything why do they pick clothes for him for school etc you cant just let kid running in mall first of all child can be abducted by predator second it can cause harm to someone in the shop or himself i cant remember the movie or tv series but there was this kid that parents let him do whatever he wants to do because hes a free spirit and it turned out to be a little spoiled brat that no one liked and this mantra they gave at the end like whaaat you know a lie repeated 100 times becomes a true if he repeats himself or parents tell him that hes awesome smart genius uberhuman hes gonna start to believe it and think that he already is the greatest so he doesnt need to achieve anything more in life sad but i hope the boy will achieve great things in life not repeating his parents mistakes and having a straight thinking",
          "its so good to see that there are others with the same mindset this is the message i preach to the father of my sons but he does not have the ability as yet to look beyond that which he knows and the unfamiliarity of my concept to his person causes me to wonder if he is resilient to see things differently my heart is firmed in the belief that making changes makes the difference",
          "this is true sometimes things happen that arent positive but out of every negative thing that happens there is a seed of opportunity for growth and change i am happy these people were able to put their differences aside and were able to do whats best for the child i am going through something similar however i dont want to be enemies with the mother of my children i will always love her and respect her for everything she gave me",
          "wow delete my comment you disappoint me as well first dont waste your time of course others your magic only works on the animal level which is like humans could be grown like tarzan as well moreover when it comes to adversaries or allies blacks asked national reparation for slavery while ignoring their ancient ancestors were alpha males who dominated the entire land of africa which was the reason why others walked out of africa by risking their lives and built their homes on other continents and became other races second i never said your magic works how could ianybody make anything based on a wrongfalse thing see you have no clear thought of what you are doing and what others saying not to mention that nobody has the responsibility to meet your expectation let alone your expectation was only a onesided imagination that only exists in your dream third easy come easy go your laziness fluke mind and to speculate advantage by trickery can only waste your time stealing others results doesnt mean you really gain what you stole let alone what you stole has nothing to do with the thing you wanted forth you have no clear thought about what you are doing which isnt a problem can be fixed by one or two magics the hard way is the only way roman was not built in one day",

          "surely coparenting means parenting",
          "why are we quiet in supermarkets it is not a library where people need silence to focus so why do we have to be quiet in supermarkets because everyone does it so we should all do it have you been to an asian market it is teeming with hustle and bustle and chaos fully grown adults are screaming haggling laughing running bumping into each other is this behavior strange is this behavior wrong so why should we teach a child that it is wrong to express themselves there is something to be learned about respect this is true but maybe the child will learn to respect people in other ways in their life and not from a scolding in a supermarket",
          "that was very inspiring and agreed with a lot they said but didnt agree that you just let a child do exactly what they want when they want the supermarket being a strong point i just didnt agree with this statement is it ok to let your child still eat with their hands like an animal so they couldnt use a fork when their older theres elements where you cant just let a child do what they want when they want the supermarket comment i found very strange your educating youre child how to behave in society et cetera just struggled with that statement if thats her view on a supermarket then apply that to everything else in life just doesnt work that way",
          "my ex isnt about equality i digress",
          "respect and sympathy are the keys for building a better relationship",
          "thats the magic power of our kids that can change ourselves only in front of this power you can endure anything and give up all your needs",
          "this is exactly what i told my ex i wanted if we ever split he was never mature enough to handle something like this our daughter is now 24 and i always wonder how different her life would have been had we coparented like this",
          "yes preach it",
          "odw i understand what you mean i agree the best we can do as parents is guide our children to have the greatest understanding of what is right in their own hearts to nurture that innocent heart at the center of the childs being to give them the clearest understanding of the world we ourselves created as a community of people among people to remain strongspirited in the crowd of naysayers children are innocent and will go astray without a well defined path for them to choose as they form and reach for their goals",
          "a child cannot have too many people who love them the best environment a child can have is parents who respect each other and not to forget that a child learns more from what the parents are than what they teach"
