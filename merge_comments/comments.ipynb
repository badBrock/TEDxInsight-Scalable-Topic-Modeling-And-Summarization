So it\\'s genuine. And it makes their message so relatable_ Parents need to watch this._ Two min in and I‚Äôm wishing all women would think this way. 50 50 parenting support... I‚Äôll stop there or I‚Äôll rant...üòñ_ Beautiful_ üòÖthat‚Äôs a gorgeous woman. We‚Äôd have to just work that out lort! Lol_ „Ö†_ Who else fell in love with this family\\'s hair_ \\'good job baby\\'_ That was very inspiring and agreed with a lot they said. But didnt agree that you just let a child do exactly what they want when they want. The supermarket being a strong point, I just didn\\'t agree with this statement. Is it ok to let your child still eat with their hands like an animal so they couldn\\'t use a fork when their older. Theres elements where you cant just let a child do what they want when they want. The supermarket comment I found very strange. Your educating you\\'re child how to behave in society et cetera. Just struggled with that statement. If that\\'s her view on a supermarket then apply that to everything else in life. Just doesn\\'t work that way._ This is truly beautiful and a lot of take homes for someone raising a Queen just embarking on this co-parenting journey. I can, and will do better. Thank you x_ My son‚Äôs father and I had an on again off again abusive relationship. It was difficult, to say the least, when we split up after 6.5 years. In a lot of ways I still have love for him, but we were always better friends than we were in a relationship. It does make our current relationships hard at times. But, as we tell our son, the one thing we all agree on is that we love our little boy. Our son has four parents & doesn‚Äôt have any memory of what it was like before. For him, it‚Äôs always been that way & always will be. We get looks & comments all the time from people who don‚Äôt understand how we co-parent. We even call each other mom & dad in public. A child can never have too many people who love him. During my pregnancy that‚Äôs what I wished for; ‚ÄúI want him to have more love, more friends & family, than he knows what to do with.‚Äù This wasn‚Äôt the future we had imagined while waiting for our baby to arrive, but for as long as we keep love in our hearts, so shall it be._ You make so much as a parent only by not talking bad about the other parent with your kid. My parents can have opinions about each other and that affects my perception very much, but luckily they never trashed each other, because that must feel like you can\\'t count on your parents or as if you had no one to trust._ Why do they...both talk like this...where they pause...at unnatural spots?_ My ex isn‚Äôt about equality... I digress... üò´_ i totally agree with your comment. If they let the kid be free spirit at anything, why do they pick clothes for him for school etc. ? you can\\'t just let kid running in mall, first of all child can be abducted by predator, second it can cause harm to someone in the shop or himself. I can\\'t remember the movie or tv series, but there was this kid that parents let him do whatever he wants to do because he\\'s a free spirit and it turned out to be a little spoiled brat that no one liked. And this mantra they gave at the end? like whaaat? You know a lie repeated 100 times becomes a true? If he repeats himself or parents tell him that he\\'s awesome, smart, genius, uberhuman, he\\'s gonna start to believe it and think that he already is the greatest so he doesn\\'t need to achieve anything more in life.... sad, but i hope the boy will achieve great things in life, not repeating his parents mistakes and having a straight thinking._ Why are we quiet in supermarkets? It is not a library where people need silence to focus. So, why do we have to be quiet in supermarkets? Because everyone does it, so we should all do it? Have you been to an Asian market? It is teeming with hustle and bustle and chaos. Fully grown adults are screaming, haggling, laughing, running, bumping into each other. Is this behavior strange? Is this behavior wrong? So, why should we teach a child that it is wrong to express themselves? There is something to be learned about respect, this is true. But maybe the child will learn to respect people in other ways in their life, and not from a scolding in a supermarket._ @scalpel\\xa0 I dont disagree but with limits. A child bounding about in a supermarket as she allows could do serious harm to a little toddler or an elderly person. Let alone heavy products in the aisles that could fall and crush them. She almost had me but then it almost felt like lazy parenting._ They are giving a speech. You need to pause at certain times to give a speech._ @Ty-iz9wd\\xa0 \\nNot...the way....they do it._ This is exactly what I told my ex I wanted if we ever split. He was never mature enough to handle something like this. Our daughter is now 24 and I always wonder how different her life would have been had we coparented like this_ Low key teared up when they did the affirmations. Black excellence personified_ I‚Äôm not crying. You‚Äôre crying. The ending is beautiful!_ I admire both of you. You‚Äôre a good example for being a good parents. Lovely watching and listening your video from the top of Italian mountain._ Awesome !_ I repeated so many times, your wrong way, your own grapes, your own food.\\nI choose my apprentices in my own way which has nothing to do with you blacks apparently since you can\\'t be reasonable by \"book\" wrote by myself. There is no \"co\" can be done. Can\\'t it be more obvious?_ Wow!!!!!_ Thus the present generation has been produced\\nIs anyone surprised_ That was so beautiful! Thank you TED!_ \"We honor each other\\'s role in Sekyu\\'s life\" \\n\\nI love that statement. Respect comes before love, always. Blessings to this family._ This is incredibly helpful for people who suffer from co-parenting_ That\\'s the magic power of our kids that can change ourselves .. only in front of this power you can endure anything and give up all your needs ..!_ These parents set an amazing example of not just co-parenting, but on being a good parent in generalüíñüòäamazing talk_ The world does not dispise black joy.._ Respect and sympathy are the keys for building a better relationship._ Wow, delete my comment, you disappoint me as well.\\nFirst, don\\'t waste your time, of course, others. Your magic only works on \"the animal level\", which is like humans could be grown like Tarzan as well.\\nMoreover, when it comes to adversaries or allies, blacks asked national reparation for slavery while ignoring their ancient ancestors were alpha males who dominated the entire land of Africa, which was the reason why others walked out of Africa by risking their lives and built their homes on other continents and became other \"races\".\\nSecond, I never said your magic works. How could I/anybody make anything based on a wrong/false thing? See, you have no clear thought of what you are doing and what others\\' saying. Not to mention that nobody has the responsibility to meet your expectation. Let alone, your expectation was only a one-sided imagination that only exists in your dream.\\nThird, easy come easy go, your laziness, fluke mind and to speculate advantage by trickery can only waste your time. Stealing others\\' results doesn\\'t mean you really gain what you stole, let alone what you stole has nothing to do with the thing you wanted.\\nForth, you have no clear thought about what you are doing which isn\\'t a problem can be fixed by one or two magics. The hard way is the only way. Roman was not built in one day._ It\\'s so good to see that there are others with the same mindset. \\nThis is the message I preach to the father of my sons but he does not have the ability as yet to look beyond that which he knows and the unfamiliarity of my concept to his person causes me to wonder if he is resilient to see things differently.  \\nMy heart is firmed in the belief that making changes, makes the difference.  üëèüèøüëèüèøüëèüèø_ Beautiful!_ Love this ._ They should have avoided divorce._ Can\\'t it be more obvious than your incoherent post? Yes._ Disagree._ üéºAbsolutely BEAUTIFULüíïüôèüèΩ_ Nice_ Now, this is a worthwhile TED Talk. I can appreciate their honesty, openness in public and desire to love their child more than they evidently could one another (although it sounds like they truly share a common love). Personally, I think It a shame that for whatever reason (none of our business what it is) they cannot be a \"typical\" family. However, they stand as a positive example for parents in the 21st century that share the marriage and parenting experience of Ebony Roberts and Shaka Senghor. May God bless and guide them and their son all together._ TED Talks are not as good as they used to be ü§¶\\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏è_ TED wouldn\\'t it be lovely if we got to see the boy as a teen, young adult and as a father as well?_ Black love on display, Amazing for the world to see. These parents are a role model for the world. Together in spirit for the child they created, even tho not together as lovers. I can\\'t say enough about how this moved me. Thank you for allowing us on the magic!_ I left the house üè† with out my charger cord or adult pampers some body üôÉ please help if this phone doesn\\'t stay charged üòë_ Thank you for being brave enough to be authentic. Your example as two individuals United is beautiful. He is a very fortunate little boy.\\nBe Safe. üò∑ \\nPeace. üé∂_ Amazing! Thankful to the wonderful parents for sharing their story.

U address the problem_ Yes u do ....it\\'s time to see jessie_ You are beautiful. What a beautiful üíì writer_ A child cannot have too many people who love them. The best environment a child can have is parents who respect each other. And not to forget that a child learns more from what the parents are than what they teach üññ_ Yes preach it_ Surely \\'co-parenting\\' means parenting._ Excellent message and talk. Comes across very genuine. Thank you._ Beast Mode is just there so he won‚Äôt get fined._ Idk this talk is dilute, watery weak, with clear reading-off-script errors. The race politics thrown in like \"a world against black joy\" is also Ludacris. TED needs higher quality material instead of these soapy opera-ey filler talks._ from the talk: \"raising a black boy in a society that despises black joy....... blacks only seen has profitable or disposable\"\\n\\nI can\\'t believe TED allowed a talk with such blatant spin on the modern world.\\n\\nOccasionally you get a good scientific one but lately it\\'s been neo liberal postmodern diatribes by yuppies or racist minorities_ @ChurchOfThought\\xa0 indeed, that is the part I didn\\'t like. If they\\'d left that out it would\\'ve been great._ So he will learn murder is cool?_ ODW: I understand what you mean. I agree... the best we can do as parents is guide our children to have the greatest understanding of what is right in their own hearts. To nurture that innocent heart at the center of the child‚Äôs being... to give them the clearest understanding of the world we ourselves created as a community of people among people... to remain strong-spirited in the crowd of naysayers.

This really has me thinking and now I want to make a list of my own. Thank you. I wish you the best!_ All the points are fascinating and illuminating, but I was must struck by the last point. To look at ideas, no matter how crazy or outright \"bad,\" through the lens of possibility is a refreshing thought. This prevents harsh and haste judgment, and can be really helpful for creativity. Specifically,  Dr. Seelig is suggesting that one should make something good out of these seemingly bad ideas, instead of finding something good inside the bad ideas. Finding something good is still saying that the idea overall is bad, but there are parts of it that are good. Making something good out of bad ideas is more positive: it is defying the judgment that the idea is bad by showing how it is actually good. Very cool!_ amazing!_ I wonder who the audiance of these TEDs is_ Love your story, message, and I particularly your analogy of the Wind of Luck and creating a Sail.

Didn\\'t I just hear this Stanford professor say \"have showed\"?  I\\'m not trying to be fussy or pernickety, but on the NPR news programs, I have heard this same category of error with past participles at least half a dozen times in the last few months.  I drink, I drank, I have drunk. Now I will hunt for a grammar book!_ Great video! Thanks!_ I really hope what people take away from this isn\\'t that out of the two main components of \\'success\\' that are luck/chance and hard work, that chance plays the minor role because people can just make their own luck.\\n\\nYou need hard work, willingness to take calculated risks and chance to be on your side to beat the odds, but chance still plays the larger role. Very few people will ever contribute more to their own success in life than all the random elements of their existence do._ Here are  what i learnt to catch the Winds of Luck : \\n\\n1.

So why don‚Äòt you talk to men instead, anyway? Perhaps because the risk is actually greater in some situations?_ that\\'s so true._ saved me 10 minutes. Thanks_ You\\'re welcome... But although they\\'re quick points, I still feel she explains them nicely and reminds us of important issues.\\nEspecially the third one is nice, imho, starting at 8:14_ These points don\\'t summarize the video I recommend you to watch it.Trust me, you will learn something great._ Thanks \\nThat Comments are always the best comments of all comments ( I like the word comments)._ Exactly_ @philippdrflr\\xa0 Pointless; doesn\\'t do her talk justice._ \\u200b\\xa0@andthereisntone3454\\xa0 I agree... people should watch the full video._ Nice video. Our company has had a similar journey where \"luck\" has played an important part._ Thanks bro_ I don\\'t know if I\\'d use the word \"coincidence\" if one\\'s actions are conscious._ You can consciously throw a can into a rubbish bin but coincidentally hit a persons face._ I believe that intention is what\\'s behind this. The intention is opening up one\\'s sails, as she says. What comes from that may be anything, but whatever it is doesn\\'t begin with a coincidence. That was my only point. Perhaps I misread you._ So faking your resume and taking risk applying for jobs = better luck!_ Basically luck is luck no matter how you try to make it sound like you have any affect over the vast multitudes of forces working in the universe. Positive thinking only makes you less likely to realize what a dismal position in the world the vast majority of us are living in. And no amount of perky little pep-talks will help people alleviate the nagging guilt from knowing they help perpetuate an unfair distribution of wealth among 99% of the global population.\\n\\nBut nice try on the updated \"Hang in there\" original cat meme._ 4 min. Couldn\\'t take that voice and faux enthusiasm!üò¨_ Luck is getting a TED talk based on mumbojumbo!_ Reminds me of the Derren Brown episode on luck, pretty much the same idea_ That\\'s networking, not luck._ You lose 100% of the risks you never take_ I thought that YOU make your luck_ Hi Tina ,it was a great experience that u shared with us ,yes I also took risk many times but failed ,but this project that I m handling now will give my idea a great kick.thanks ted talk,fr india_ When we look at law of averages, higher luck or probability can be attain by having more tries._ One neat trick: If you release a horrible video about the need to indoctrinate children in the classroom, and most people who see it are completely disgusted and dislike it, you can quickly release a decent video only hours later, there by not appearing so bad._ This wasn‚Äôt very coherent..._ Great talk üôè and thank you for sharing üåπ_ Analogy for what she explained:\\nRolling a dice is chance, but the more you roll, you\\'ll get something good more times (you\\'ll get bad more times too)._ Everything happens for a reason_ Stupid presentation. \"Luck\" is a by product of good planning_ Without execution of works, success does not pop in. \\nWithout work-idea, execution of works can not happen.\\nWithout knowledge, ideas do not sparks. If at all it sparked, you are not able to catch them.\\nWithout direction, without coaching, without crash course, without study, without labour, knowledge does not happen.\\n\\nAnd if you do labour, even in unknown area, you have chance to get success until unless somebody is not behind you making you unsuccessful.\\n\\nSo for any success, there is  labour and dedication, which arranges for success. That labour is nothing but leaving the comfort zone.\\n\\n#birenk_ 20 years studying something that doesn\\'t exist._ I dont believe in luck._ This is so relatable..thank you so much for sharing your experiences!_ Yes but u will be fired if ur not doing a good job so luck can only get u so far_ goodatparties.exe_ You save 100% of the losses you never risk._ You lose 100% of the time you spend on TED talks_ Ëã±Ë™û„ÅÆË®ÄËëâÈÅä„Å≥Ëçâ_ An children are murdered everyday. What risks should they have taken? You know who are lucky? Wicked people_ djpailo. the lesson here, just take the chance bro rather than do nothing. That\\'s the only thing that can create the possibility of success probability._ When we look at the law of averages, lower luck or probability can be attained by having more tries. Over time with more tries the successful instances will go up, yes, but the unsuccessful instances will increase at approximately the same rate. And thus the ratio of successful to unsuccessful events should stay relatively stable at a greater number of tries. So, your luck will increase but that includes both bad luck and good luck. But if you merely need a singular success, or if the expected value of success far exceeds the expected ramifications of failure then you are right, the opportunity has a positive total value._ Quantity first, Quality second_ @geckgeck8616\\xa0 Thank you for making sense of the law of averages for me._ Bad analogy. You won\\'t get it more often, you will just get it more times._ If you don\\'t roll, you won\\'t ever get anything that you want. But if you do, you have a chance of getting that something. The more you roll, the more that something gets close to you. And what\\'s the worst that could happen? You\\'ll get nothing. Well, if you don\\'t roll, you won\\'t get anything anyway so we\\'re nowhere at a loss here. That\\'s her point._ But life is not a dice if you get 6 thats it you have to build on that_ David Exactly, she\\'s probably referring to dumb luck._ Con artist_ I think your good luck appears when you are surrounded by good people appreciating you_ Luck comes with unluckiness many times_ Its Very interesting !   !  !_ nice speech, awful examples at the end_ Tina Seelig, Thank you...   Chiquito..._ Lucky she was seated next to a publisher on that flight._ Increase my luck at winning the lottery and I\\'ll be impressed._ Then it\\'s not luck....._ Some people literally Don\\'t have luck a bit in their life, anything they do is just the opposite of the outcome they want (ie me) .\\nBut still i think there\\'s something Sexy about it!_ I have always been told I am lucky but it\\'s those who don\\'t understand it doesn\\'t come without risk, appreciation and an openness to new ideas._ Yeah, let\\'s see a man randomly talking to lots of women on transport and see how lucky that guy turns out_ Translation in Portuguese (Brazil) please. üôÇü§ó_ Great talk! now, I understood everything happened into my life! And now, I took the risk of commenting on this video to say Thank you for this wonderful talk._ Her voice.....Bobs Burgers , Linda Belchers sister_ But most of the time when I try to take a risk it leads me into failure......\\nI guess I\\'m not that lucky to make my own luck._ Thank you_ So basically, luck = having a big network. But good talk regardless._ Translation in Arabic please_ What a bullshit video. This woman is clearly someone trying to make a living, giving no answer other that cowdung pseudo maybes. What a waste of air...._ Blaa_ Maybe I\\'ve spoken to every person I\\'ve sat next to using public transportation._ Well maybe if it wasn\\'t a publisher, it would have been someone else, who would\\'ve made an even bigger impact on her life. Maybe in that sense, she was unlucky. It\\'s all relative, the situation is neither lucky or unlucky, it\\'s what you make of it is what\\'s important._ Maybe if it wasn\\'t a publisher, it would have been a screaming child._ \"Lucky she was seated next to a publisher on that flight.\"\\nAs opposed to a million other people that might have turned into a lucky opportunity of some kind by talking to them and being open to trying something, and her groundwork she laid by even having a book idea ready.  You missed the point._ Lucky yes, but lucky often times only happens when effort collides with opportunity. Just saying she was lucky feels like you take away from her effort. And that is the point here, imo._ Everybody is pitching their books to publishers even people who never wrote any. Everybody is boring doctors with their problems. Everybody is... So about her luck: she had a good book. She also went extra mile to do something for the publishers and THAT is where she gets respect._ Passenger 57...?_ Is not about luck is about being ready when opportunity arrives._ She created her own luck_ She had the book pitch ready. And was bold enough to show it to him. You lost the plot_ O√ÑKTA DOPBOK buy more tickets_ Just by one ticket. Buying more than one doesn\\'t increase your chance as much as buying just one instead of zero ;)_ Well, if he\\'s talking to lots of women, he\\'s more obviously on the make, rather than just casually striking up a conversation with his seat-mate._ because women are delicate and men are scary? there exemplifies the problem. why not instead send the message that when men talk to you, there\\'s nothing to be scared of. This is contextual of course, ie don\\'t talk to a drunk man in a dark alley, but in the given context ..._ bro, he\\'s on the make either way. be real_ oh bullshit, this is feminazi nonsense ... some women are dangerous too, not least of all because they can say what they like about a man or accuse a man, and political correctness will render them defended. Well, congratulations, men don\\'t want to approach women any more. They don\\'t even want to argue. That\\'s why divorce rates are rocketing, birth rates are on the decline, and fatherless children are becoming criminals. Now don\\'t get me wrong, some men ARE dangerous, and some women have very legitimate reasons for divorce etc ... but no more so than 20 years ago. The recent societal symptoms are very much a product of the villification of men. I can tell be the way you talk you\\'re part of the problem. You speak in the collective - \\'why are Ted subscribers like this\\' ... \\'women and girls don\\'t enjoy being approached\\' ... sorry but who are you speaking about and on behalf of? If you\\'re scared when a man approaches you, why don\\'t you take a minute to observe the individual, rather than defaulting to the villified collective? Jesus, it\\'s like women think we are all rapists, it\\'s insane. All right, men try to get laid more than women do, it\\'s been that way since the dawn of man, but that doesn\\'t mean you have to feel the need to \\'defend\\' yourself when one approaches. This is the sort of attitude and language that is causing severe and pernicious effects on society._ well, considering i didn\\'t mention \\'white people\\' in any of my comments, i\\'d take a look in the mirror before commenting on anyones apparent agenda. as for your comments on ted subscribers, i imagine these people are here because they enjoy debate and science and current affairs and learning - maybe these are people you should listen to when they talk about feminism, instead of writing them off?\\n\\nNo, birth rates declining are not a good thing. They\\'re sympotmatic of the breakdown of the family unit, which has a host of pernicious problems, far more pressing than projections of global overpopulation. They also indicate that women are choosing careers over children, and that\\'s a can of worms i won\\'t go into but essentially, feminism has pushed women away from traditional roles and in turn is making childless women unhappy in the long run. This is statistically documented and you can google it. Way to go, feminism.\\n\\nI have nothing against dating apps, although they are quickly becoming populated with middle aged women suddenly aware of their biological clock ticking, so that speaks for itself. \\n\\nIf you want to restore trust, move away from these alarmist, victimhood philosophies that you are clearly a votary of._ There are captions. Hope that helps._ Ces Soriano That\\'s a lot of risk. Glad you\\'re okay._ @dingdong1519\\xa0 yes, I\\'m good. And because of this risk, I got lucky to meet you!_ Ces Soriano haha.

You are not to call this a failure, but an opportunity to learn. Perhaps you improved your ability to overcome shyness or your conversational skills. In the bad cases you might work on polite exit strategies. Her kind of luck takes work...!_ Risk is risky for a reason     . Take too little and you stagnate but take too much and you may lose your life savings  or a limb or two ...._ Cloudhex Not necessarily. It\\'s also about doing the right thing at the right time._ Are you serious? Did you even watch this talk?\\n 1) take risks and get out of your comfort zone // 2) show appreciation // 3) change your relationship with ideas... \\nSo it\\'s a little more than Just \"having a big network\". She didn\\'t even mention Network once..._ Phillip you are right. I noted down all ideas of this video. But I don\\'t find that you only require big network. Here he teaches us how to simple risk can be a great opportunity.  The more we take risk, the more our luck introduce._ She is so right!_ 9th_ It is amazing channel_ Luck is when preparation meets opportunity.\\nMe, I just cash mine in at will._ Yendo a la casa de Dami√°n camin√≥ por el boulevaaaaard_ Sixth.._ noun\\n1.\\nsuccess or failure apparently brought by chance rather than through one\\'s own actions._ Yeeeah,fiiirst_ first second and third comment_ first like_ yo_ 3rd_ \"apparently\"_ You are incorrect.

I am happy these people were able to put their differences aside and were able to do what's best for the child. I am going through something similar however i don't want to be enemies with the mother of my children. I will always love her and respect her for everything she gave me._ Powerful & Amazing_ I can‚Äôt take a guy with dreads and a Detroit hat on on a ted talk seriously at all sorry üëéüëéüëé_ How They Both Move Close To Each-other As They Talk ü•∫_ Now these are 2 beautiful grown black adults...not Cardi B and Offset lol_ Thank you._ I think it's so wonderful how they are speaking to an audience but really to each other. So it's genuine. And it makes their message so relatable_ Parents need to watch this._ Two min in and I‚Äôm wishing all women would think this way. 50 50 parenting support...

Lol_ „Ö†_ Who else fell in love with this family's hair_ 'good job baby'_ That was very inspiring and agreed with a lot they said. But didnt agree that you just let a child do exactly what they want when they want. The supermarket being a strong point, I just didn't agree with this statement. Is it ok to let your child still eat with their hands like an animal so they couldn't use a fork when their older. Theres elements where you cant just let a child do what they want when they want. The supermarket comment I found very strange. Your educating you're child how to behave in society et cetera. Just struggled with that statement. If that's her view on a supermarket then apply that to everything else in life. Just doesn't work that way._ This is truly beautiful and a lot of take homes for someone raising a Queen just embarking on this co-parenting journey. I can, and will do better. Thank you x_ My son‚Äôs father and I had an on again off again abusive relationship. It was difficult, to say the least, when we split up after 6.5 years. In a lot of ways I still have love for him, but we were always better friends than we were in a relationship. It does make our current relationships hard at times. But, as we tell our son, the one thing we all agree on is that we love our little boy. Our son has four parents & doesn‚Äôt have any memory of what it was like before. For him, it‚Äôs always been that way & always will be. We get looks & comments all the time from people who don‚Äôt understand how we co-parent. We even call each other mom & dad in public. A child can never have too many people who love him. During my pregnancy that‚Äôs what I wished for; ‚ÄúI want him to have more love, more friends & family, than he knows what to do with.‚Äù This wasn‚Äôt the future we had imagined while waiting for our baby to arrive, but for as long as we keep love in our hearts, so shall it be._ You make so much as a parent only by not talking bad about the other parent with your kid. My parents can have opinions about each other and that affects my perception very much, but luckily they never trashed each other, because that must feel like you can't count on your parents or as if you had no one to trust._ Why do they...both talk like this...where they pause...at unnatural spots?_ My ex isn‚Äôt about equality... I digress... üò´_ i totally agree with your comment. If they let the kid be free spirit at anything, why do they pick clothes for him for school etc. ? you can't just let kid running in mall, first of all child can be abducted by predator, second it can cause harm to someone in the shop or himself. I can't remember the movie or tv series, but there was this kid that parents let him do whatever he wants to do because he's a free spirit and it turned out to be a little spoiled brat that no one liked. And this mantra they gave at the end? like whaaat? You know a lie repeated 100 times becomes a true? If he repeats himself or parents tell him that he's awesome, smart, genius, uberhuman, he's gonna start to believe it and think that he already is the greatest so he doesn't need to achieve anything more in life.... sad, but i hope the boy will achieve great things in life, not repeating his parents mistakes and having a straight thinking._ Why are we quiet in supermarkets? It is not a library where people need silence to focus. So, why do we have to be quiet in supermarkets? Because everyone does it, so we should all do it? Have you been to an Asian market? It is teeming with hustle and bustle and chaos. Fully grown adults are screaming, haggling, laughing, running, bumping into each other. Is this behavior strange? Is this behavior wrong? So, why should we teach a child that it is wrong to express themselves? There is something to be learned about respect, this is true. But maybe the child will learn to respect people in other ways in their life, and not from a scolding in a supermarket._ @scalpel¬† I dont disagree but with limits. A child bounding about in a supermarket as she allows could do serious harm to a little toddler or an elderly person. Let alone heavy products in the aisles that could fall and crush them. She almost had me but then it almost felt like lazy parenting._ They are giving a speech. You need to pause at certain times to give a speech._ @Ty-iz9wd¬† \nNot...the way....they do it._ This is exactly what I told my ex I wanted if we ever split. He was never mature enough to handle something like this. Our daughter is now 24 and I always wonder how different her life would have been had we coparented like this_ Low key teared up when they did the affirmations. Black excellence personified_ I‚Äôm not crying. You‚Äôre crying. The ending is beautiful!_ I admire both of you. You‚Äôre a good example for being a good parents. Lovely watching and listening your video from the top of Italian mountain._ Awesome !_ I repeated so many times, your wrong way, your own grapes, your own food.\nI choose my apprentices in my own way which has nothing to do with you blacks apparently since you can't be reasonable by \"book\" wrote by myself. There is no \"co\" can be done. Can't it be more obvious?_ Wow!!!!!_ Thus the present generation has been produced\nIs anyone surprised_ That was so beautiful! Thank you TED!_ \"We honor each other's role in Sekyu's life\" \n\nI love that statement. Respect comes before love, always. Blessings to this family._ This is incredibly helpful for people who suffer from co-parenting_ That's the magic power of our kids that can change ourselves .. only in front of this power you can endure anything and give up all your needs ..!_ These parents set an amazing example of not just co-parenting, but on being a good parent in generalüíñüòäamazing talk_ The world does not dispise black joy.._ Respect and sympathy are the keys for building a better relationship._ Wow, delete my comment, you disappoint me as well.\nFirst, don't waste your time, of course, others. Your magic only works on \"the animal level\", which is like humans could be grown like Tarzan as well.\nMoreover, when it comes to adversaries or allies, blacks asked national reparation for slavery while ignoring their ancient ancestors were alpha males who dominated the entire land of Africa, which was the reason why others walked out of Africa by risking their lives and built their homes on other continents and became other \"races\".\nSecond, I never said your magic works. How could I/anybody make anything based on a wrong/false thing? See, you have no clear thought of what you are doing and what others' saying. Not to mention that nobody has the responsibility to meet your expectation. Let alone, your expectation was only a one-sided imagination that only exists in your dream.\nThird, easy come easy go, your laziness, fluke mind and to speculate advantage by trickery can only waste your time. Stealing others' results doesn't mean you really gain what you stole, let alone what you stole has nothing to do with the thing you wanted.\nForth, you have no clear thought about what you are doing which isn't a problem can be fixed by one or two magics. The hard way is the only way. Roman was not built in one day._ It's so good to see that there are others with the same mindset. \nThis is the message I preach to the father of my sons but he does not have the ability as yet to look beyond that which he knows and the unfamiliarity of my concept to his person causes me to wonder if he is resilient to see things differently.  \nMy heart is firmed in the belief that making changes, makes the difference.  üëèüèøüëèüèøüëèüèø_ Beautiful!_ Love this ._ They should have avoided divorce._ Can't it be more obvious than your incoherent post? Yes._ Disagree._ üéºAbsolutely BEAUTIFULüíïüôèüèΩ_ Nice_ Now, this is a worthwhile TED Talk. I can appreciate their honesty, openness in public and desire to love their child more than they evidently could one another (although it sounds like they truly share a common love). Personally, I think It a shame that for whatever reason (none of our business what it is) they cannot be a \"typical\" family. However, they stand as a positive example for parents in the 21st century that share the marriage and parenting experience of Ebony Roberts and Shaka Senghor. May God bless and guide them and their son all together._ TED Talks are not as good as they used to be ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è_ TED wouldn't it be lovely if we got to see the boy as a teen, young adult and as a father as well?_ Black love on display, Amazing for the world to see. These parents are a role model for the world. Together in spirit for the child they created, even tho not together as lovers. I can't say enough about how this moved me. Thank you for allowing us on the magic!_ I left the house üè† with out my charger cord or adult pampers some body üôÉ please help if this phone doesn't stay charged üòë_ Thank you for being brave enough to be authentic.

The best environment a child can have is parents who respect each other. And not to forget that a child learns more from what the parents are than what they teach üññ_ Yes preach it_ Surely 'co-parenting' means parenting._ Excellent message and talk. Comes across very genuine. Thank you._ Beast Mode is just there so he won‚Äôt get fined._ Idk this talk is dilute, watery weak, with clear reading-off-script errors. The race politics thrown in like \"a world against black joy\" is also Ludacris. TED needs higher quality material instead of these soapy opera-ey filler talks._ from the talk: \"raising a black boy in a society that despises black joy....... blacks only seen has profitable or disposable\"\n\nI can't believe TED allowed a talk with such blatant spin on the modern world.\n\nOccasionally you get a good scientific one but lately it's been neo liberal postmodern diatribes by yuppies or racist minorities_ @ChurchOfThought¬† indeed, that is the part I didn't like. If they'd left that out it would've been great._ So he will learn murder is cool?_ ODW: I understand what you mean. I agree... the best we can do as parents is guide our children to have the greatest understanding of what is right in their own hearts. To nurture that innocent heart at the center of the child‚Äôs being... to give them the clearest understanding of the world we ourselves created as a community of people among people... to remain strong-spirited in the crowd of naysayers. Children are innocent and will go astray without a well defined path for them to choose as they form and reach for their goals._ I could see him itchin for skittles the whole speech_ Yall powerful i appreciate yall_ Had to be black people?_ I wonder if either of them moved on relationship wise or even remarried and how that affected things... I'd like to hear more._ Be mother without control!???? I want to see her when the boy be a teen_ It's so cute how they all have dreds yall.üò≠_ Why couldn‚Äôt I have had these two for my parents. Absolutely amazing_ üíñüíñüíñ_ I would have loved to co-parent with my ex-wife unfortunately the b** did me dirty in the divorce, and somehow got it to where I couldn't have my daughter for visitation until she could talk when she was 4 years old so she could say what was wrong with her.  Like me, my mother, and my grandmother had no clue on how to raise a child. After that relationship was broken it never mended. My daughter will be 23 this year and I haven't actually talked to her since she was 15. Her mother convinced her I only wanted her when it was convenient and she hasn't matured enough to realize how much bullshit her mother fed her. however she had no problem calling me in February and asking for $4,000 so she could move to Connecticut, with her younger sister._ https://youtu.be/mCYFxt_9aco_ PRICELESS.

         "Bravo!_ A successful mindset isn't something that you simply attempt to follow for each day, it requires a continuing series of thoughts, that are selfless. When it involves success, regardless of what your definition of success can be, having positive thoughts may be a must.\r\n\r\nA positive line of thought is one amongst the key factors that differentiate a successful person from the one who isn't ready to achieve their definition of success. it's said that thoughts precede actions. So, if you're surrounded by negative thoughts, your actions will have slightly of negativity to them. And with negativity, you'll never succeed._ Happily we are more and more spread all over the world, sharing such a proactive attitude ! Maybe two more elements : we could also find another encouraging example in the XVIe century. The humanity then was also confronted some really terrific threats. Result ? One of the most brillant period of the humanity known by the histoy as Rebirth ! Second element, and another main challenge : the drastic and actually not correctly managed mutation of the communication channels and speedness that  for the being escapes the essential qualitative filter of a democratic (i.e. pluralist) press. We have also to reinvent an efficient democratic press able to spread through the social network hope and positif attitude ! Cause without hope and positive mind, how could we expect a right entrepreneurship for initiating a second Rebirth... i.e. referring to the  immemorial myth of the Phoenix !_ Boycott animal agriculture, the leading cause of environmental destruction! Let's replace the egotistical anthropocentric worldview for ecocentric worldview where nature and everyone in it has a value of their own and not just as a resource to exploit! ‚ù§Ô∏èüçÉ_ Wonderful talk, powerful message BUT 3:40 is wrong from so many fronts and it's sad to hear it from someone working for the UN when the inequalities are not reduced but exacerbated: \"Will Russia wreck the negotiations, will China take the responsibilities for their emissions, will the US help the 'poorer' countries deal with their burden of climate change.\" Portraying Russia as evil, China as the one responsible for the emissions, and the US as the saver of the world is so cilche and so HARMFUL. Will the US take responsibility for its factories in China? Will it take responsibility for its own emissions before criticizing others (it's the second emitter of CO2 in the world)? I love the US and I believe in the potential of the UN but, please, stop dividing the world on 'good' and 'bad' and stop putting all the responsibilities on others. Let's be a bit more critical of ourselves and inclusive of others. And not the opposite. Afterall, that's where you truly approach the issue with love - by empowering and being ready to learn the opinion of others, and that's where the real change begins._ Hahah yes, China and Russia are the bad guys for their CO2 emissions, but the main question when it comes to the US is whether it can help the poorer countries with their emissions.\nNice choice of words, you biased figs.\n\nAny TED talk that starts with a story about UN is a TED talk you should avoid._ US and the western word should take more responsibility on climate change, even your production are done in overseas, you are the consumers.

It feels like an optimism that is ethical not unrealistic. Gramsci talked about \"Pessimism of the mind and Optimism of the will.\" A friend of mine has this quote from Vaclav Havel on all her emails \"Hope is an orientation of the spirit an orientation of the heart. Hope, is an ability to work for something because it is good, not just because it stands a chance to succeed.\" Jonathan Lear has a great book on this called Radical Hope._ I LOOOOOVE TED_ Energizing and motivational talk\n\nThank you_ Thank you for convincing me to get up.

Boo._ Green screen m8_ Great talk but if the source of that stubborn optimism is to get behind Trump then count me out, or better still, I would rather go it alone and do what I can for my fellow humans and not for Trump's ego and political agenda._ Thank you for this‚ù§_ so powerful!!!_ This is one of the greatest TED talks I‚Äôve ever watched._ Good as audio.

Everybody wanted to restore germany after the great war and worked to heal themselfes and the world just with iron will and diszipline. Long story, but it didn't turn out very well, just like this speech._ I'm actually liking this TED format! Beautiful talk!üëå_ Great how to video, definately giving me ideas for videos on my channel ! \n\nThank you for motivation :D_ Great talk but I wish he'd move his hands more üëÄ_ #xr_ Fabulous_ Loved your talk.. can't explain how much I needed to hear that._ Someone edit a barbell or gavel in his hands._ The UN is the future as globalization continues rapidly, but there will be a time in the future when \"the people\" will turn on the UN as a \"One World Government,\" and oppose them. The conspiracy theorists who oppose any rule of power and law will always try and undermine any good being done with a sceptical eye. Simply put, the idea of a small room of people dictating all of the world's big choices, will become the establishment to dismantle._ so...at the end, The Beatles were right...._ The best one I heard from his talk was \"it's scary now but let's approach it with love.\"_ Very weird hand movement. His words do not connect to the hand movement.\n = He is not telling honestly, because his body movement is telling otherwise._ i originally thought this was gonna be a ted talk on ‚Äúthe law of attraction‚Äù lol_ \"Is it really true that humans will only take sustained and dedicated action on an issue of paramount importance, when they feel they have a high degree of control?\" No, this is not true! Humans will only take sustained and dedicated action on an issue of paramount importance if and only if they feel the pain - given that taking action involves a reduction or delay of immediate gratification. Our brains are based on locally optimal optimization not global one, although the later is theoretically possible, it must usually be enforced by pain and extreme fear._ Nothing is going to change unless we all admit to ourselves, the real problem is capitalism._ I thought this talk was brilliant_ The problem is that organizations like UN WHO are totally corrupt, economically and politically. Bad actors like CCP controlled China are clearly not on the par for humanity other than coercion and bribery._ I understood your works‚ù§_ —Ç–≤–æ—é –∂ –¥–∏–≤–∏–∑–∏—é, –∞ –º–Ω–µ —á–µ –¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å_ Thank you for your concern,As a Bangladeshi climate crisis is now every day issue and touching every one in minimum or maximum  way like unwanted heavy rain in Dhaka, heat, sudden flood in river side or heavy storm in coastal area..........._ GRITTIER, DETERMINED, REALISTIC, STUBBORN OPTIMISM üî•\n\n\"we now need to move beyond this narrative of powerlessness.\" üëè\n\n\"we can no longer afford the luxury of being powerless.\" üëè_ I wish I wouldn't have read this comment before watching the video. All I could do was to watch and see how much he moved his hands._ yeah his hand movements are weird. but his words make sense and are true. judge a book by its cover?_ He's probably putting into practice a TED lecture he's watched on body language. Unfortunately, he's gone over-the-top and is forcing himself to wave his arms around hoping to emphasise what he's saying. üññ_ @quAdxify: Thank you for providing this example of the mindset we are offered to shift away from. Not untrue, but only significant if you believe mind-change (and the attendant changes to the underlying neural network) are not possible. I, for one, have experience that such change is possible._ None of that is due to climate change._ The best so far_ 3 Ways To Future-Proof Your Career : \nInvest in yourself.\n\nContinuously learning and developing keeps you both at the top of your game now and in the right mindset to adapt to change in the future. By making learning part of your routine, it will become a habit and your brain will become used to consistently taking in new information. This way, when a big change happens, you‚Äôll be ready to learn what you need to do to stay ahead of the curve.\n\nTake the time to learn new skills that will help now as well as in the future. Stay on top of new innovations in your industry. Keep a pulse on what‚Äôs going on internally at your company. Think about where you‚Äôd like to be in the next five years in terms of job title, position, and company you‚Äôre working for. From there, figure out the most important skills related to those jobs or positions, and make that your priority for learning. Being aware of what can come next and staying open to options will set you up for future success.\n\nYou don‚Äôt have to go back to school to learn. In fact, learning as you‚Äôre working is usually a far more effective method. You‚Äôll be able to stay current in your industry and learn specifically what you need, rather than following a rigid set curriculum. If your company offers education as part of your development, take full advantage of it.  If you plan to make a drastic career change, that‚Äôs when formal schooling could be beneficial.\n\nCreate the job you want to do.\n\nJob titles and roles are changing, and you have the power to use this to your advantage. If you‚Äôre not feeling satisfied or fulfilled in your current role but there isn‚Äôt another role available, create one. This is a particularly useful way of gaining more knowledge and developing your skillset without having to leave your company.\n\nWhen you‚Äôre pitching an idea for a new position, make sure to be detailed in your explanation. Explain the responsibilities of the new position, how it relates to your current role, why it would be beneficial to the company, and of course why you‚Äôre the right person for the job. Be prepared to answer any questions that you‚Äôre asked, and always frame answers by highlighting the value it adds to the company.\n\nNot all companies will be amenable to this, but it‚Äôs always worth having a conversation with your manager to see if it‚Äôs a possibility. If nothing else, it shows them that you‚Äôre serious about development, and can put you on their radar for the next opportunity that opens up. You can also use this as an opportunity to transition into a conversation about ways to take on more responsibility, or even set yourself up for a promotion.\n\nPut down your phone.\n\nThere‚Äôs a whole world outside of your phone. Too often, we use our phones as a defense mechanism. In an uncomfortable situation? Pull out your phone. Don‚Äôt want to talk to someone? Pull out your phone. It‚Äôs easy to hide behind a screen, but it‚Äôs far more effective to put it down every once and a while. It‚Äôs even changed the way we communicate. We spend so much time on our phones for work that we get too accustomed to texting and typing rather than having conversations with people in person.\n\n\nRather than spending all of your time focused on digital ways of connecting with people, mix things up a bit. Make it a goal to have a five minute conversation with someone each day. Go to a networking event after work or happy hour with your colleagues. Networking events are a great way to help you step out of your comfort zone and practice face to face communication. You‚Äôre able to meet new people and learn about what they‚Äôre doing. It might even spark an idea for you to explore.\n\nThere‚Äôs no way of telling exactly what the future of work will look like, so it‚Äôs important to keep a pulse on your industry. By preparing yourself now, both by learning and putting yourself into the right mindset, you‚Äôll be able to take the changes in stride and be ready for anything that comes your way._ Uhh sir, this is a Wendy‚Äôs._ Lockdown was the most useless and idiotic move ever causing more damage than good.

Actually he should write poetry    But to me the UN is a corrupt organization run by the US.  And until it gets out of the grip of the US it's not going to do any good.  It's not a fair representation of the world.  Sorry that's how I feel about it and I'm an American.  Okay now you lost me once I saw that picture of Mahatma Gandhi.  When are people going to learn to think for themselves that man was a child rapist and a molester he does not deserve to be on anybody's high list of greatest people on earth.

But have you tried looking at any of Hans Rosling's work? It might keep you from getting depressed._ It seems that way only because we haven't actually reached the Apex of humanity. We need a few more cycles facing cataclysm in order to band together and evolve as a species. Right now, our minds our busy consuming everything. We are consumers of resources. We are still unawake to the need to work with universal law instead of for our selfish gain. \n\nI believe this is also the message being conveyed in this video. It does seem like we've overpopulated the planet, but that's only because we haven't learned yet to work with nature and harnessing it through technology._ Andrew Kline Idk I found him engaging and insightful- I think he did a good job keeping the audience‚Äôs attention (in my opinion), because of the purposeful way he spoke and how he emphasized the importance of particular issues and ideas with his body. \n\nThe topic was about shifting one‚Äôs mindset, and he didn‚Äôt say what steps you‚Äôd have to take to get there, but he actively shifted mine into a more optimistic point of view like, ‚Äúno matter if we win or lose the battle I‚Äôll try my best and do my part because I believe in what humanity COULD be- and I believe in good.‚Äù I liked the fact that he was in the woods too, it made the setting more peaceful and enjoyable to look at._ I feel like ted talks should include their personal ideology.

I love your oxygen mask analogy, I can totally relate!_ Since taking office, President Biden has distanced himself from the previous administration by¬†highlighting racial equity, including in his approach to appointing agency officials and a new Supreme Court justice.\n\nWhile representation is a critical component of racial equity, deep systems change is necessary to achieve meaningful transformation. Biden‚Äôs approach has notably failed to address the systemic racism inherent in our immigration system, which his administration has weaponized to expel Black people seeking safety in the U.S.\n\nAmerica‚Äôs immigration system was designed, from its inception, to keep Black immigrants out. Today‚Äôs immigration system‚Äîstarting with the asylum process and detention centers and ending in immigration courtrooms‚Äîcontinues to make use of historical mechanisms for denying Black people entry to this country.\n\nOver¬†147¬†countries, including the U.S., recognize the right to asylum, which guarantees protection to those fleeing persecution on account of their race, religion, nationality, or other protected grounds. But to obtain asylum, a person must first reach a U.S. border‚Äîa notorious site of racialized inclusion and exclusion.\n\nThis foundational requirement‚Äîthat a person physically knock on America‚Äôs door‚Äîwas the first ‚Äúline of defense‚Äù the U.S. used to keep Black migrants out. In the 1980s, the U.S. deployed the Coast Guard to block 23,000 Haitians fleeing Jean-Claude Duvalier‚Äôs repressive regime from reaching our borders. Of those¬†23,000¬†people, eight were granted asylum.\n\nIn the 1990s, the U.S. again intercepted Haitian refugees. Of those 37,000 people, just 300‚Äîless than 1%‚Äîwere granted asylum. After campaign promises of more compassionate immigration policies, President Biden forcibly expelled at least¬†10,000 Haitians¬†from our¬†Southern border¬†without due process; none were permitted to seek asylum.\n\nToday, the U.S. continues to create and support policies intended to deter and push back Black migrants, preventing them from touching U.S. soil through a system of racialized border exclusion. The Biden administration continues to employ a¬†deeply flawed and racist metering system, a legacy of the Trump administration that creates greater obstacles for Black migrants, requiring them to submit more documentation than others to be added to the list for entry.\n\nBlack migrants suffer from disparate credibility findings during credible-fear and reasonable-fear proceedings, and blanket denials for humanitarian parole and Title 42 exemptions. The problem is so entrenched that a hundred Democratic legislators from both Congressional houses have submitted a¬†letter¬†to President Biden voicing concerns about the administration‚Äôs treatment of Black migrants.\n\nImmigration Detention Policies Are Oppressive\n\nImmigration detention policies further oppress Black migrants. In the 1980s, our system of mass detention was created to keep Central Americans and Haitians out, giving rise to the criminalization of asylum and the modern system of immigration detention.\n\nIn the 1990s, the U.S. government held intercepted Haitian refugees in cages for a year at an ‚ÄúHIV prison camp‚Äù at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Now, Immigration and Customs Enforcement detains approximately¬†20,000¬†immigrants each day in a vast network of federal detention centers, private prisons, state prisons, and jails.\n\nBecause police disproportionately arrest Black individuals, juries disproportionately convict them, and judges levy disproportionate sentences against them, Black immigrants are¬†disproportionately¬†funneled into immigrant detention. Not only are they detained for longer periods of time, they are¬†six times¬†more likely to be subjected to solitary confinement.\n\nAnd once Black immigrants enter immigration courtrooms, they face judges with crushing caseloads¬†and¬†about four hours¬†to make a life-or-death decision‚Äîthe precise conditions in which racial bias thrives. Implicit bias and institutional shortcomings inevitably impact how an immigration judge perceives an applicant‚Äôs credibility.\n\nBecause of bias and institutional racism, Black people historically have been perceived as dishonest and untrustworthy. So it is no surprise that immigration judges are more likely to find Black immigrants less credible than those of other races.\n\nFailed Policies Need Correction\n\nThere is much that this administration must do to correct the long history of failed immigration policy. First, Biden must push Congress to eliminate the harsh criminal bars to asylum‚Äîbars created in the late 1990s, which have steadily expanded since then. He must advocate for an end to detention of immigrants‚Äîespecially mandatory detention‚Äîwhich can result in the imprisonment of immigrants for years after they have served their criminal sentences.\n\nAnd to combat discrimination in immigration courts, he can require that immigration judges participate in increased anti-bias training; he can hire with greater racial diversity; and he can create work conditions conducive to thoughtful, merits-based decision-making‚Äînot ‚Äúrocket dockets‚Äù or expedited legal proceedings.\n\nRacist policies that restrict the movement of Black people and other people of color and subject asylum-seekers to mistreatment and detention while their legal claims are processed, disproportionately harm Black migrants. It is time to recognize these injustices and enact policies to prevent them.\n\nThis article does not necessarily reflect the opinion of The Bureau of National Affairs, Inc., the publisher of Bloomberg Law and Bloomberg Tax, or its owners.\n\nWrite for Us: Author Guidelines\n\nAuthor Information\n\nTsion Gurmu¬†is the legal manager of the Black Alliance for Just Immigration, the first national immigrant rights organization for people of African descent.

I can't say for sure what they would have done today if faced with the modern tangle or red tape but I'm pretty sure they were desperate enough that they would have circumvented it. Anyway, I think the whole \"my family came here legally so yours should too\" misses the apples and oranges nature of the equation.

If that isnt diversity i dont know what is._ @pattikubota¬† ¬†That would assume leftist people think conservative ideas are great - which is is an insane notion in itself.

Whether they call it a ‚Äúrescue package‚Äù or ‚Äúquantitative easing,‚Äù in the end it‚Äôs all the same: the government pays companies to stay operative.\nI don‚Äôt think it will work in the long run. It may keep companies afloat for another six months or a year, but as a rule, a government, any government, cannot sustain companies that cannot sustain themselves. In the end, the situation will blow up in a blast that will be worse than what it would have happened had the government let them fall naturally.\nThere is more to it than that. I don‚Äôt believe that a government can do anything good for its people. Civil servants, ministers, and deputy ministers always pull their own way and have their own interests in mind. Since everyone is inherently selfish, everyone has an ulterior motive that is not for the benefit of the public.\nWe cannot expect selfish people to do unselfish acts; it is like asking a tiger to become vegetarian. If it goes against nature and it won‚Äôt work. Therefore, asking people whose only focus is their own career to focus on other people‚Äôs well-being is unwise, unrealistic, and will invariably fail.\nSocialists, capitalists, far right, or far left, they are all immersed in egoism. It is not their fault; it is human nature, and we should adjust our expectation from our leaders.\nIf we want a real and lasting positive change, we must transform human nature. Since our nature is selfish to the core, changing it is the only way out of the crises that the world is falling into nowadays. We will fall deeper and deeper until we realize that the problem is not the fuel we burn, the forests we cut, the water we pollute, or the people we kill. The problem is the cause of all those harms we are inflicting on nature and on each other: our inherent self-absorption.

Let stop using animals as food and as pets, and let the wild ecosystem rebuild themselves to be robust so there will be less chances of contracting these infections.

My utmost respect for Dr. Larry Brilliant & what he has devoted his life to. Continuing onto a more serious note, I wish some of those that are in leadership positions would have listened & took the advice of those that truly understand Epidemiology & all the other people knowledgeable in the scientific community. I understand that everyone is trying to do their best. A lot of people have lost their lives, granted not as many as some to past outbreaks, but it just boggles my mind that in the day & age we are in, this actually turned into a pandemic all over the world. There are so many people on this beautiful planet that are suffering unnecessarily &/or have their lives turned completely inside out & upside down to something & why?!?! All because of the unprecedented unpreparedness & incompetence of some that have been either elected or whatever. Not like anything like this has happened on such a scale as it has in the past but there were definitely similar viruses that have emerged.

Our society is being held hostage by the \"tie\" of medical care to a job. A person should have medical care, education, and social security and pay for it when they \"spend\" their money, not when they \"earn\" it. So, the Federal Government should enact a \"national consumption tax\" of 2 cents on each dollar spent for \"Medicare for all\", another 2 cents for Social Security and another 2 cents for Education through 14 years. Now this doesn't require anyone to file a tax return, it is free and automatic according to your age and the number of years you have been paying into the \"system\". A person that \"buys and sells\" for their occupation may \"spend\" more than the average person and could \"file\" for reimbursement after some \"high\" value is reached each year. Now, after this \"new system\" is in place for several years it can be adjusted simply to create the proper balance in the economy and made to run smoothly with the average person having healthcare, free education, and Social Security at retirement. Another 2 cents could be collected to \"pay the national debt\". In 2021, Americans spent 5.2 Trillion dollars on \"stuff\". One man spent $1.5 million on a \"non-fungible token\" of a basketball dunk. He should have been required to pay a \"tax\" on that purchase which benefits all people. Now that this new tax is in place, the U.S. should ask Mexico to become the 51st State of the U.S. and begin collecting the \"NCT\" tax from Mexico. This act should then encourage all of the Latino population to \"go home\" where they will have the same \"medical care\", education and social security as in the U.S. (If that is the reason for the border wall). The U.S. should \"welcome\" immigrants and provide work for them \"growing food for the world\". Irrigate the deserts and grow food. Another country, Ukraine, ask them if they will become the 52nd State._ It takes a bit of ignorant arrogance to grasp this concept; Stop racism for yourself.

The dog whistle politics have done more to create the economic inequality the vast majority of Americans have suffered from than anything else. Of course, none of this would be effective if we simply lived and socialized with one another. But not much has changed in that regard since desegregation. All races have their own communities, and for some reason, we all just naturally accept that this is completely normal. Until that changes, we won't change and we will continue to be adversely affected by dog whistle racism that is always used to win votes in order to shape public policy for the wealthiest at the top._ \"If you can convince the lowest white man he is better than the best colored man he won't notice you picking his pockets.\" \n\n-LBJ  1960_ The only thing more glaring than the sun is the truth._ Just ordered her book._ Damn I'm too late I just saw a ring on your finger so that mean you are married damn_ I saw your interview on c-span one Lyndon Johnson was the biggest racist you've ever seen to the Democratic Party  Was against the civil rights act and stopping you to vote you need to get your facts straight before you take your big mouth on TV and publicize what you say cause   Because half the stuff you say is making no sense it's not historically correct And Lyndon Johnson was the biggest presidential racist this country has ever seen he even hated Martin Luther  And the Democratic Party was based from the Ku-Klux Klan In goal in history was to stop black people from doing anything But you still hope for just like them share croppers that said Hey you know we'll give you money if you work but then they didn't Just get your history straight you sound stupid_ Bullshit. Just complete bullshit. Call it out when you see it._ Racist= Insecure_ Racism is a business to preserve and protect a nation and race and will never leave this world all over the world unity and divisions will always remain._ COMPLETELY wrong logic . The great financial collapse of 2008-09 was due to happen for more factors than racism, sorry Heather !  \n1. Business Cycle timing\n2. Derivative bets in level 3 assets \n3. Homes bid up to extreme inflation adjusted levels\n4. RE cycle rolling over\n5. Regulatory missteps on Fannie and Freddie\nand much much more ............\nand yes those borrowers of all races were snookered by lender, but (sigh) they did get the money .\nCRT is marxist based and divided people into 2 classes and focuses on equality of outcomes (communist redistribution) and NOT equality of opportunities(which the USA has , albiet inperfectly) Yes there is a problem but lets stop criticizing all whites and stop calling them names and enact solutions of forgiveness and true equality under the law._ Take about cutting your nose to spite your face .. America takes to a whole other level.._ This isn‚Äôt new. I am not gullible. If she has nothing nice to say, I don‚Äôt why I am wasting my time hearing someone talk about a group that she believes she knows inside out.

I don‚Äôt know the intentions of this video, but I am asexual._ This was phenomenal._ GODDAMN!!!,....progress is SLOW....üòü_ Police being sued for wrongful, conviction and brutality almost every day... racism is a costly stupid ideology_ I had to watch this for school and I'm so glad! This brought me to tears, you have moved me. You're a great presenter!_ Thank you for discussing this. Such an important discussion._ I suspect that lack of universal medicare in the US is due to a racism mentality. That is I a white person will not put in a dollar in the kitty so that we can all have medicare because it will help the black person. I'll pay for my own medical care and let the other guy (black) pay for his own._ Reminds me how social security was seen as a good thing when black Americans were excluded from it, but as soon as they were included later on all of a sudden they became ‚Äòentitlements‚Äô. such bullshit._ \"We would not have had a financial crisis if it weren't for racism.\" I'm not sure that she made the case for racism here, or whether the amoral financial traders just defrauded people where and when they could. If you're a thief, you're not worried about who you steal money from._ No such thing as racism, there is only good and evil right or wrong, the word racism was made to segregate the races, if you ask a so called ‚Äú racist‚Äù why he hates people of another race they NEVER say it‚Äôs because he hates there skin shade or race, it‚Äôs always other factors, the word ‚Äúracism‚Äù was made to protect one race of person and not another, I would argue the word racist is actually more so called ‚Äú racist‚Äù than anything or anyone could ever be_ Amazing talk..

Way to overlook EVERYTHING in the above comment and not respond to any of it. Small minded people have small minded fans I guess._ If this is about the subprime mortgage financial crisis of 2008, I believe this form of sloppy security was devised to bilk folks out of their real estate. Many folks of colour ended up being victims. Many Caucasians did as well. To my knowledge, no one has presented evidence that the perpetrators intended to harm more persons of colour. I may well be wrong_ You kidnap a people from their homeland and then treat them this way and on a land that isn‚Äôt even yours to begin with. What slums did you flee from in Europe? Don‚Äôt ever expect to be allowed to use our pools in Africa._ MY gosh, what a waste of 15 minutes._ Reading her book for my book club, so much insights and truths!  \"It cause us all to be divided!_ That happened 60 years ago chill_ simply do not resist arrest or put yourself in a situation where the police are after you and you will not be mistreated by police. This goes for everyone, not only other races._ The Sum of Us is so damn good. \nThank you for breaking it all the way down!!_ Policymakers know all of this..perfect example is the opioid crisis...if laws and policies and treatment were put in place during the drugs crisis which ripped through the black communities in the 80s and 90s we wouldn't have all these deaths of white people from opioids..because a system would already exist to stream and help them_ Asking for a photo ID to vote is not out of touch with reality which leads me to You Are Out Of Touch with reality Ms Mcghee_ It is something of an irony that the original people of our world can find the strength to unite the divisions which they did not create , in a country torn apart by ignorance and astonishing stupidity. True stength is only possible with right - mindedness / mindfulness. It is a privelidge for me to see and hear the power of truth and the echos of unity.

Reparations? Pay back, for something that happened hundreds of years ago?\nGive me a break, I still get flack from people of color, difference is, I don‚Äôt let them bully me anymore. \nSpare me your race baiting, you are the racist one._ Clear and present danger to making Americans and America great!  Racism!_ I feel like we have been waiting for her and her message since at least Jesse Jackson's campaign in 1988, maybe since Dr. King died. A very important voice, a game-changer, since if we all realize, or at least the vast majority of us realize that racism is bad for us and we have a real stake in overcoming it, our odds of overcoming it expand exponentially. And a lot of possibilities open up for things we could do that we have not imagined._ Heather McGhee has a real good book called \"What Racism Has Cost Us, I have just ordered it._ Fails to mention the huge public expenditure with Johnson on War against Poverty and affirmative action legislations.  A bit selective on evidence to serve a narrative. An objective analysis is the beginning of a real discourse._ American White Supremacists eat their own. The rich ones are more than willing to sacrifice the poor ones as long as people of color are kept poor too. It's not a loss of money for them since it all goes to the richest white racists. That's why the USA has more billionaires than next 3 on the top of the world list combined (China, Russia and Germany)._ ‚ÄúWe would not have had a [2008] financial crisis if it weren‚Äôt for racism.‚Äù  I call b.s. on that statement!_ Bravo!!! Thank you thank you thank you!!! Finally acknowledgement that our lives matter!! BLM is not a terrorist group, we also believe all lives matter, so punctuating black lives in urgent crisis right now is far from terroristic_ \"For one person to gain wealth another must lose wealth.\" I understand that it may seem that way, but it's not true.  If you have $1 and I have an apple, and you want an apple and I want $1, we can trade and we are both better off.  Check into it, you might be surprised!_ It‚Äôs true with their capitalist logic but it‚Äôs not true. In Africa we believe in Ubuntu and we have a totally different idea of wealth and economy.  Europeans have a different way of how they view wealth and economy and how they relate to people. They believe in winners and losers. Deprivation. Africans culturally we don‚Äôt think that way with one another. Our civilizations and economy‚Äôs were based on wealth and communal and were great pre-European contact. That‚Äôs why many of our kingdoms and empires lasted so long.  I‚Äôm talking 500 to well over 1000+ years. African culture is far superior.  European ‚Äúcivilizations‚Äù if you can call it that only last 200-300 years, if that. They consider enslaving, killing and dispersing Africans worldwide, making the Asians dependent and decimating the native Americans and destroying the environment and wildlife as‚Ä¶.advancement? That‚Äôs traits of an inferior and truly the lowest type of humanoid. Only a psychotic person thinks the way whites do such as win/lose, black/white, this/that, cops/robbers etc._ Thanks for the information._ Ubuntu <3_ This punctuates the idea of a preference for a perpetual failed state due to racism. This was a beautiful piece. Congress can learn some lessons with messaging here. Thank you, Ms. Heather McGhee!!_ Thank you, Heather. American racism is a pyramid scheme, and I wish more people would understand that_ So, the housing crash started because of policies intended to target race. Now very few young people can afford a home regardless.

It was almost at 1miillion ??_ racism is kinda cringe ngl_ Racism hurts white people. Patriarchy hurts men. People who seek to take rights and privileges from others end up hurting themselves in the process. I dont know as much about racism, but I do know about sexism. Men's pride and privilege leads to higher suicide, higher incarceration, higher crime, higher homelessness. I probably dont need to explain what patriarchy does to women. And we could have helped each other this whole time. Prejudice is a double edged sword and no one is safe_ \"I'm more interested in holding accountable the people who are selling racist ideas for their [own] profit than those who are desperate enough to buy [them].\" Excellent metaphor!_ Who is here because of Cody's showdy?_ I came looking for this video after a couple clips from it were used in today's episode of the \"Some More News\" youtube show. Thank you, Ms McGhee, for sharing a perspective our country desperately needs right now!_ I had always thought this but didnt really have the knowledge to speak on it. Now I can!

Yes, there are eight billion of us we speak six thousand languages planet-wide, and we're divided by two hundred competing nation's ( five thousand eight hundred populations have no voice). We are all in this together, one planet people.\nThis was/ a superb talk, I've shared it, it gives me hope._ Real good talk_ Thank you._ Loved you on armchair #cherrie_ I'm with you. \nI'm thinking we need to criminalize racism. \n(We could call it The War on Bigotry) \nHate Crimes._ The FCC should have more leverage over FOX News._ Holding KKK and White Nationalists gatherings should be charged as conspiracy and domestic terrorism, ANY associated act of violence should be punished with things like \"enhanced sentencing guidlines\" and habitual racists should be put away for extended prison sentences._ The Showdy typically leads  in good directions._ Here's some news, Cody is a legend_ Guilty. The man cites his sources well. And what an excellent TED talk to use as a source._ Yup_ @maximo0987¬† you mean, here's 'some More news'?_ It's called \"The Sum of Us: What Racism Costs Everyone and How We Can Prosper Together\" - which will be out in February 2021. :)_ She's right. It really doesn't have to be this way._ I am tired of these idiots talking about racism._ Great info!_ Absolutely no mention of the fact that blacks are a massive net negative in regards to taxes and economy.\n\nFigures.\n\nYou talk about shutting down public services when blacks were allowed.\nThey overwhelmingly disrespect the facilities and pay no taxes.\nBut God forbid you should look at any position that does not support your own.\nAnd apparently capitalism is bad, but only if it takes advantage of minorities.\nAre you implying they are not smart enough to have responsibility?\nIf whites are victims, no one notices.\nMuch less cares.\nAnd yet somehow instead of blaming the people actually responsible (Wall Street) you cry \"RACISM!\"_ Here in the Islands, everyone is a minority!  We live together, Play together & Laugh together!  Yes we even make jokes of all ethnicity here!  No one is left out -  We all laugh together!!!_ I want to change too. I want to be better._ Does anyone know where i can look at the research she is referring to? (About the subprime loans)_ üçíüçíüçí_ The origin and source of racism is from Satan and his demonic minions that are unseen spiritual beings who all mock humanity as the so called \"Image of God\" (see Genesis 1:26-27) while directly mocking God who created them for wasting his divine precious time to create them since by how they live they prove they after they to be unfit as the \"image of God\" accusing them also before God (Revelation 12:10). The seed of racism was sown in the thoughts and hearts of men after man was cast out of the Garden of God called Eden but went into full effect after God changed the language of the whole earth from speaking one language to speaking multiple languages as we see this day. After the whole earth dispersed by language (Genesis 11:7) from under the Towel of Babel regions of the world where each group settled the climatic conditions in the region where they settled for some changed the color of their skin and hair, for some their eyes became slanted and for some other areas of the body slightly mutated all according to God's choice to make his creation called man though in a fallen state colorful and radiant in his eyes. After Satan and his demonic angels saw the dramatic change that God had made in his creation called \"man\", they saw it as a great opportunity to effectively pursue their diabolic plan of racism in the human heart to hate one another with the difference that God had made while rejecting the truth that they are all brothers and sisters and are the children or sons of God from Adam the first created man who was the son of God (Revelation 12:9, Luke 3:38). \"For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places\" (Ephesians 6:12). \"Look not upon me, because I am black, because the sun (or climatic condition) hath looked upon me: my mother's children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard have I not kept\" (Songs of Solomon 1:6). From the Garden of Eden, all people were of one skin color but after the whole people on earth who congregated in one place on the earth were dispersed with the change of language to the where each group of people settled, there was a change in the color of the skin and God did not to make people hate one another but to make his creation and son called man colorful and radiant in his eyes. Jesus who came to lead all men back to the Father said \"the greatest commandment is that you love God and your neighbor as yourself (Matthew 22:37-39). Your neighbor is anybody around you whether near or far who actually is your brother and your sister from one Father. Think for a second about living in the world with just one color of people while everything around you looks colorful including the very garments or clothes you wear. For example, if a so called white person hates a so called black person and if the color of skin is his problem, why does he or she wear a black garment, suit or attire loving the way it looks on the body. You see, the hatred is a thing of the heart and not of color. Just take a look at the color of every race with the white and black race as our example here, the skin of an African does not really look \"BLACK\" and the skin of the Caucasian does not really look \"WHITE\". So they color \"Black\" or \"white\" is simply used to identify a particular race but the color identity has over many generations for thousands have been a  logical label for why they should hate a person or a people whose color of skin looks different from them. Be wise therefore and learn to love your neighbor even your very brother and sister. It is a spiritual test on humanity to prove those who love and those who hate and are of that \"Wicked One\" called Satan (1 John 3:12)._ This is an amazing video!! Very informative and offers a new perspective_ Who is doing the dividing?_ Thoroughly enjoyed #armchairexpert podcast.  Here's another bump!_ Armcherry here üôå_ OK, but racism doesn't have to be bad for everyone for it to be bad. It sounds a bit like you're trying to convince white people why they should care, but they should care even if racism is only bad for people of colour._ Thank you for making this talk plain, simple, and factual_ Armcherry here! Thank you for the work you‚Äôre doing! You have such a beautiful and eloquent way of speaking and putting things. You‚Äôre helping to change the world! ‚ù§Ô∏è I hope we cross paths one day!_ Came here from Armchair Expert.  No where near 1 mil but I bet we can get it there.  Lets go Armchairies!_ I was told about this talk through my church‚Äôs anti-racism study. I can‚Äôt wait to share it in all of my circles. Profound and powerful thoughts for everyone to know and act on._ Another armcherry! Already preordered your boom. Loved this Ted talk and your conversation with Dax and Monica. Thank you so much for all of the information!_ Arm chair, WHOOP, WHOOP!!_ It doesn‚Äôt but whites are narcissists who believe in the zero sum game. It‚Äôs the way you think and operate. You are incapable of change, are unable to adapt to any environment and you can‚Äôt get along with black people._ Which islands?_ Hawaii?_ That‚Äôs nice but you and I both know you are incapable of change. You have proven you can‚Äôt get along with black people for 500-1000 years._ Suffice it to say it was a little more complicated than racism._ But how do you explain that to a person that has been indoctrinated to believe in individualism¬ø_ Her book \"The Sum of Us\" is the best book I've ever read! Highly-recommended_ Thank you Dax and Monica for alerting us to this fine Ted Talk. I learned so much on your show today from Heather!!_ Very insightful - I had not realized how racism contributed to the 2008 financial crisis._ I can't wait to read your book when it comes out!_ Armchair expert brought me here to rewatch this and now I'll be sharing it to bring even more views! I am learning and unlearning and doing what I can! Thank you so much for your work Heather! Donating to the organization you mentioned right now._ Armchair_ Armcherry here. Will definitely be reading your book!_ How with a subscriber count of more than 17 million has less than 80 thousand (on the morning of June 5th 2020) bothered to watch this? Wake up and listen people. We all survive together or we don't survive at all. One planet one people._ Brought here after listening to armchair expert :) great ted talk. Hope it reaches 1M_ So much wisdom here. One of the best Teds I've seen._ Arm cherries are listening!_ Hi Armcherries!_ One of the best speeches I‚Äôve witnessed. If you do well and all your neighbors do well, irregardless of whether they‚Äôre like you or not, won‚Äôt your town or city be undoubtedly better off?

Such sense._ Maybe an economic perspective can actually help some people get this - it‚Äôs a language they understand. Sadly. Awesome Ted Talk - the world needs more people like this great woman üëè_ Beautifully said Ms. Mcghee_ Um Ted top_ Just think its some racist people in the audience that really need to hear this._ And of pure greed._ Wow. Your comment made me cry and gave me hope. As a 49yr old black wife, mother, and professional I am truly exhausted and traumatized from years of trying to be heard, understood and valued.  My tolerance extremely low and sometimes absent to continue these conversations.  It's such a blessing to have fresh legs like yours in this fight!! I thank you for being opento hear and go._ @keishapuryear8180¬†No need to thank at all. I usually try not to make myself known in spaces like these because I am hear to listen and not take up space but I wanted to boost Heather's video. I've written multiple replies to you that I've deleted because again you don't need to hear me go on and on. But I want you to know that your feelings and exhaustion are so valid. ‚ù§Ô∏è_ @shellseamarie¬† contrary to what you stated, some of us need to hear your support. Some of us face losing hope each time we learn of an atrocity.  The more people like you share your support, actions, changed minds, Love and concern the better. We never know when one might be on the verge of giving up,and words give them hope._ @keishapuryear8180¬† ¬† I'm so glad mine found you. I would say I'm so sorry that this is even you reality but I'd rather show you by action. I'm raising two young boys that I'm trying really hard to mold into responsible humans on this planet._ @shellseamarie¬† I too am doing my part.  Raised 2 children, boy and girl to know the truth yet love all people. But I've also had to raise them from both a proactive and defensive viewpoint sadly in hopes my teachings won't need to one day save their Ives when facing a violent encounter_ Me too!!_ Just got done listening the episode on armchair, amazing talk\n\nWhat happen to the view count?_ Word._ Otaku Fascist Brotherhood¬† You are welcome to step on stage._ Exactly!_ Hi. Its regardless not irregardless_ I know right?!_ @We might still make it, shaken,  but maybe, maybe still yet.  God bless!!!_ Good point..._ Her book \"The Sum of Us: What Racism Costs Everyone and How We Can Prosper\" is fantastic! Check it out if you haven't._ Lol_ That's exactly the problem with many western countries these days. They view many Asian countries as enemies. While actually we all earthlings actually have shared future. With this pandemic, and climate change crisis, it should be clearer than ever that we should unite to solve these problems together... üò¢_ totally BS and lies again. First of all black peoples are racist too! She is suggestintg that only white peoples and 'majority' of the society can be and are racist ! NOT!_ A pretty good talk overall and very uplifting. However, I am wary of the kind of endless focus these days on certain identitarian issues like racism. Yes, it is a big issue, of course. But -- ironically -- focusing too much on that starts to become counterproductive, I think, because it ignores the very real suffering & neglect of other groups. Many struggling, suffering working-class people hear the endless drumbeat about white/male privilege, for example, and feel totally alienated by it and accused of something they don't feel guilty of. This makes them resent the accusation, become defensive, and fight against it. They don't understand the subtle nuance and complexity of the issue. Instead, after being addicted to pain meds and getting laid off and in debt and behind on rent and walked out on by their girlfriend, when some university professor or rich media anchor is talking about how privileged they are, they get angry. Who can blame them? I don't blame them for not understanding an issue on a nerdy academic level, and taking it personally, and then wanting to stick it to the \"libs\".\n \nThese talking points are so wonderful for the rich and elite, because it keeps most people arguing about race and gender, etc., without pushing for what would really change things for the better which is economic reform. \"Yes, keep them talking about privilege, that way they won't focus on fixing the tax loopholes and political corruption that keeps us at the top. Let them point the finger at each other, not us. Stir up their anger on social issues so they ignore the capitalist machine that keeps them funding our wealth.\" NYT (owned largely by billionaire family), Washington Post (owned by Jeff Bezos), and all the media titans seem to go along with this._ It is interesting to observe that the majority of Ted talks given by blacks consistently have lower overall views than other Ted talks despite their content being just as good, if not better._ Excellent_ I think in the base they are right; what is good for one group is bad for an other group. The problem is they do not understand which group they are in. They are in the common, working people group, together with a lot of other people with a different color or religion. The other group may look like them (white and male) but they have nothing in common with them besides that. The other group are the rich and powerful. The problem is that somehow they are made to believe that that is the group they actually belong to. And they want to believe that._ Great stuff_ Thank you for studying on humanism. I appreciate your work. After all, we all want to make better society and better community, and work hard to get there. We don't hope much but yet we still do from the bottom of our hearts.._ Thank you so much for talking of this argument. Lovely watching and listening to you here on the top of Trentino Italy mountain._ This is one of the best TED talks I've ever seen. Racism can truly cost everyone._ 4:00 Uh oh, I guess only white people are racist...funny how she had to go back about 90 years for the example that followed..._ I like this focus more on holding accountable people who are \"selling\" racist ideas than ppl buying them. But it's so embedded, built into the system, not sure how..._ while she makes some excellent points, I feel that she fails to identify the roots of the problem, namely capitalism and the patriarchy.   both are systems of inequality, oppression and exploitation.  the patriarchy creates a gender divide and capitalism creates a socio-economical divide._ ‚ÄúRealise that our fates are linked‚Äù_ This world may survive without love but not tolerance._ My Skype ID is jovano.mata\nIf you wanna practice English call me there and we can have a good conversation and learning together_ 8:32 what's that?_ Bu nasƒ±l geli≈ümi≈ülik b√∂yle ya nasƒ±l bir insan renk farkƒ±ndan ayrƒ±lƒ±r anlamƒ±yorum.

They can be ‚Äúaddicted to meth, girlfriend left them, and lose their jobs‚Äù and they will STILL vote against benefits that would help them if it benefits blacks.  Maybe you should be trying to promote them looking WITHIN instead of appealing to our empathy so that we can understand them.  They‚Äôve been projecting, defending and outsourcing their discomfort (especially of considering their racist habits) on others for far too long and IT DOESNT WORK!_ @Melinamiu007¬† Well, I think you're overplaying the racism factor a little bit. \nCommon people are very very easily manipulated into voting against their own interests out of plain old fear: fear of the \"other\", fear of immigrants, fear of non-christians, fear of change. Political snakes are experts at using fear to drive the working class against minorities. You can't just blame the common people. You can't blame them for being too gullible and suckered. Just like I wouldn't blame you for possibly believing some liberal propaganda as well.\nGotta go after the corrupt people in power who are intentionally poisoning the minds of Americans every day, like the horrible Tucker Carlson._ @Melinamiu007¬†  Also, you don't listen to people who don't respect you. So, why are they gonna listen to sanctimonious self-righteous people (like yourself??) telling them how immoral they are?_ @thebatonmaster¬† of course, an educated economist is discussing factual data and the strongest correlation the data has shown and it‚Äôs wrong (no questions asked) because it just doesn‚Äôt FEEL true to you.  Why am I not surprised.  Pfftt, and I‚Äôm the self righteous one. üòí_ @thebatonmaster¬† also check your triggers.  discussing racism is NOT the same thing as questioning someone‚Äôs morals.  It‚Äôs a sociological construct that is prevalent in our society to which some people benefit (or believe they do)  so much so that they vote against themselves.  That thinking error is the reason it‚Äôs impossible  to speak to someone such as yourself about this topic.  See Roosevelt ¬´¬†convince the lowest white man that he‚Äôs better than the lowest black man and he won‚Äôt see that your picking his pocket.¬†¬ª_ @Melinamiu007¬†  Dude, what are you talking about? I seriously don't follow.\n \nI didn't mean to insult you by suggesting you might come across as sanctimonious. I mean, you yourself said multiple times now that they are voting against their interests because they dislike blacks. That is obviously a moral judgment you are making in assuming the root of their voting motivations. Thus logically, you are being \"self-righteous\".\n \nYou don't have to get angry and tell me I can't possibly understand, blah blah, lol. I'm not trying to antagonize you, I'm just trying to make a point about how liberals like yourself talk down to people. You're doing it right here in this thread, passing moral judgment on people with too broad of a brush.\n \nYour attack is really weird because I don't disagree with the ponts of the presenter. You imply that I am saying their findings are \"wrong\" (your words) but that's not true at all. I agree with the presenter. I'm just adding additional commentary on top of it about points that I believe need to be added.\n \nVery often when people start making accusations about \"check your triggers\" and that I reject things because \"it just doesn't FEEL true\" (your words) it is the one pointing fingers that is more emotionally aggressive.\n \nCalm down Miranda. Relax. I'm not your enemy, I'm not a conservative villain, I'm not blinded by partisan cheerleading, I'm not trying to harm the underserved minorities, etc. Try being open minded about the content of what I'm actually saying here._ @Melinamiu007¬†  You know, when I wrote \"like yourself??\" I considered deleting it because I knew it might set you off. And clearly it did.\nMy apologies. I didn't mean it in an offensive way, I was trying to suggest that you look at your own words and see how they come off as condescending. But I should have been more careful in how I worded it. But YouTube comment sections don't usually attract good-faith responses anyway :-\\_ @thebatonmaster¬† I‚Äôll just say lucky you that you have the privilege of accusing POC of ¬´¬†overplaying racism¬†¬ª and move on with your day.  Unfortunately WE have to live with it on a daily basis but too bad people like you are just not interested enough to really inquire about the complexities of that.  We get your kind of response every day.  It‚Äôs literally like talking to a wall.  Again, lucky you._ @Melinamiu007¬† lmao, i'm mixed race, you fool. Take a chill pill and stop trying to position yourself as a poor victim. Not all POC think the same, luckily._ @thebatonmaster¬† i dont position myself as a ¬´¬†victim¬†¬ª gaslighter. It is YOU who talked about poor poor white folk looking for POC to be angry at because we make them feel bad by telling FACTUAL TRUTHS.  Victims ignore ignore facts and blaming the fact teller.  Who likes to ignore facts out of the two groups? You can be mixed and still be racially white.  Or you can be one of the many jokers that use YouTube‚Äôs anonymity to pretend they‚Äôre POC so they can gaslight them by maliciously lying about who they are.  Given your lack of concern for the issues POC face, I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôre  one of the two._ I noticed that too.

This victimhood woman is perfect example as she uses a white man who brought up statistical facts and call it racism. LOL_ God I'm sick of all these ignorant people in the comments.

US property markets are know for low equity rates and few regulations regarding the financing. Thats why other markets (i.e. Germany) with stricter regulations which reguire more equity and income are more stable.

No matter what race, all Americans (white/black/latin/asian/... ) overfinance and consume more than they can afford in case of unplanned negative ecomic impacts..._ loved it_ I have tried to fight systemic racism by promoting the n-word changing into a less racist definition.  Even my family does not support this.  It seems obvious to me that if the n-word meant human we'd all be better off, but everyone wants a racist n-word.  Very disappointing._ So much division, destruction and crisis JUST BECAUSE OF COLOUR_ Well done. Thank you for presenting and representing The True American Dream. üíñüòé_ Generally when people call someone racist, all they're really doing is attempting to censor their speech because they can't deal with their argument. \n\nAnd generally calling someone racist is it self racist because the term is generally only used to bludgeon and silence white people._ The problem is not race the problem is that everyone thinks multiple races exist. We have made laws in the USA to guarantee that division continue. We are taught from birth that there are difference races and yet DNA has proven that their is only one race the human race. By the way Heather Main is not the whitest state in the Union Vermont is. On the mainland The District of Columbia is the blackest, New York-Newark-Jersey City the Asian Americans and Alaska has the most American Indians, who cares regardless if you are born here or moved here and become a citizen you are a US Citizen plus nothing minus nothing. This is not a black and white issue the Asian Americans born in this country have been attacked by both Black and White people stabbed and beaten, Asian Americans that have never been to Asia. Yes we have a problem and regardless if you want to accept it or not you are part of the problem. You are almost out you still have one foot in. It is unfortunate that we will never talk or have an opportunity to do so, if we did I might be able to set you free so that the limits that only exist in your mind could be dissolved and you could find your way out of the cave you are now in. Nice Talk it is just not exactly._ The pool was destroyed not because of racist policy, but on the contrary, because the non-racist court desided it's for everyone._ Your wrong, your against whites being prejudiced but not blacks being prejudiced_ Does that mean Clinton allowed all blacks to get a house when they couldn't afford it.

The inability people have to step outside their own experiences and to be willing to try to understand situations which do not affect them ASTOUNDS me. People are still talking about racism because it STILL disproportionately punishes colored people.\n\nPeople not liking white people is not the same as racism. The racism that my white ancestors have perpetrated on the rest of the world was based in a real and documented belief in their own racial superiority, believing they had a right to take what they wanted because of it. When people don‚Äôt like white people, it is distrust of an historically and provably untrustworthy people who took (and still take) advantage of other people groups based on the belief that their way of life is superior. That is not racism. That is racism backfiring. That‚Äôs what she‚Äôs talking about. If you‚Äôre tIReD of hearing about racism, then participate in routing it out so that it is no longer perpetrated on people of color and so that our descendants don‚Äôt have to bear the consequences of our refusal to accept our responsibilities.

That is a form of racism.  What she did is assume she knew something about someone else based purely on his race.

Our science is inherently designed to never be ‚Äúsatisfied‚Äù and thus will investigate deeper into ‚Äúreality‚Äù even after it has become apparent that this is ‚Äútrue in fact‚Äù ...and even after using available resources becomes unsustainable/unreasonable- some will continue to divide & investigate. The process is similar to a manufactured crisis in which we create the ‚Äúproblem‚Äù & ‚Äúsolution‚Äù.

Sure deflation would slow down the economy, by allowing people to work less than 3 jobs and start saving to buy that house instead of living in constant debt. Instead banks just create money devaluing currency (affecting those who cannot hedge and keep most assets in cash / checking account) and pouring the value into mortgages with interest rates lower than inflation making it reasonable for people to take the mortgage (but actually only to those who can pay for it upfront and keep some reserve) and keeping property prices high by all the unreasonable demand. What about those who unreasonably take the mortgage? They just bought an overpriced house. They'll have to work harder, hoping they can pay for it, risking to loose it all.\n\n\nNow I'd rather give deflationary spiral a try. With cryptocurrencies it's much easier to hedge small amounts while keeping them liquid.

It‚Äôs still prejudice and discrimination, just not institutional prejudice or institutional discrimination.

IMBECILE!_ Fabio Fernandes¬† (edited) always means 'was drunk while writing'_ I am just gonna say it because a statement you made is factually incorrect. Most science is based on slavery. I am from Greece, where a lot of science and democracy started, the reason ancient Athens was able to flourish in those fields was in part because of the culture that pushed for it but also because there was a number of slaves considered to not be citizens of the city that did all the manual labor. Spartans had also enslaved a neighbouring city and they were more progressive when it came to women's right.\n\nIt has always been the case that countries that are able to exploit the most people will also do the best economically. If you think about it a country with no slavery or no exploitation might have 5-10% bellow the poverty line, but if they can exploit foreign people in any way and have them suffer and be bellow the poverty line then they might be able to push their own above the poverty line to the expense of the others.\n\nUS's economical boom was based on exploiting others. Guess who pushes science the most, the US. Guess what pushes science within the US, military spending on RnD for new and better ways to exploit others.\n\nI am sure humanity as a whole would be better if we were all equal, but playing dirty looks to me like it's paying off for the ones exploiting._ Move to a poor black neighborhood in the U.S., and stay there for a year. Pretty soon you'll be singing Dixie._ @BankruptGreek¬† Your projections are unsubstantial and tell more about you than they do about facts. Firstly the Ancient Greek civilization is not known for many scientific origins. It is known far more from its birth of the Classical Philosophy by the likes of Socrates, Plato and Aristotle. Indeed it is a part of many modern western philosophical foundations since. Slavery existed mostly during 9 000 BC (Neolithic era)-1900 AC but the history of science is far longer than that even though what it has been called as has changed trough out history and hasn't had a systemic framework methodology all of its existence.\n\nHowever what is a projection is the conjuction fallacy you employ that it was because of slavery. It wasn't. Historical records demonstrate that while slavery was practiced in many areas of Ancient Greece, they served a different role depending where they were and slavery was mostly practiced in Athens overall mostly by those who had wealth. So landowners and such. It existed elsewhere too in Ancient Greece but in much smaller numbers. It is coincidental that you brought up Spartans since consensus of historians is that they were more like serfs than slaves in Sparta. Of poverty, people have been under the poverty line ever since agriculture and the concept of wealth was invented, both of which proceed kingdoms and nations by several thousands of years, especially concept of wealth that was found even in Bronze Age.\n\nIf your projections had any basis in empiricism, they would have to be replicated everywhere trough out history ever since time and memorium. However historical, anthropological nor archaeological documents and research does not support your hypothesis. For example in the Islamic  Golden Age they did not practice slave trade at the time until the last century in some countries by the time of collapse and shift. In fact while they did practice slavery, it was actually later on than when Ancient Greece started and majority of slave trade lasted even up till past 20th century. The overwhelming majority of Islamic Golden Era was simply because back then they were a central point of trade, wealth and civilization with little competition. Ancient China while the earliest records are from Shang Dynasty roughly 1 500 BC, the practice was not widely used trough out the areas history and despite that China is known for many scientific innovations, Eastern Philosophy and works of literature and art.\n\nIn more modern times if your hypothesis had even remotely any basis in empiricism, lack of exploitation would necessarily have to mean a country lacks wealth. Yet this is also again not a replicated result, as many exploiting countries like Turkey or Somalia are not wealthy or prosperous (to varying degrees) but countries like United Arab Emirates or Norway are extremely wealthy simply because they have oil.\n\nHeck even your segment about science in US is somewhat wrong. The military doesn't drive science there, wanting to improve the world and/or profit does. Your reasoning makes no sense whatsoever. A doctor who found a cure for cancer did it so that the American military can go and cure people from cancer. The military industrial complex exploits science but doesn't drive it. Albet Einstein famously said that he would not have ever published his findings of fusion if he knew how the American Military would use it to create weapons of mass destruction rather than its intended use on clean nuclear energy. Most top American universities attendees for the past near century now these days has been mostly foreign students. Some stay there due to economic opportunity but many do not. US is able to patent most scientific discoveries because they have the infastructure and are one of the largest countries on the planet. Per percent by population index they are slightly above average. So your analysis is incomplete and deeply flawed._ @PRmoustache88¬† I've been an exchange student in countries where I was a minority. Didn't change my perspective whatsoever. See one of the basic fundamentals of healthy human behavior and social interaction is that people learn from others trough mirror neurons.

With that logic you can't be racist against black people in African countries because they hold political power there. \n\nOr do you want to argue that since white people were slave holders and colonisers only they can be racist? What about Nordic European countries that had no place in the Slave trade? Or how about the Chinese or Indian or Middle Eastern hatred of black people? I guess they wouldn't be racist if you follow that line of logic.\n\nAnyway, arguing about the definition of racism isn't really going to fix anything. If \"racism\" is indeed born from prejudice + power, then it's prejudice that's the root of the problem. And it should be eliminated for all races._ @sarah4326¬† The standard definition can be seen in a dictionary. Definitions provided in academic papers are non-standard, and lack any form of rigour._ @sarah4326¬† Your responses make it look like you are trolling; it is hard to imagine someone is as deluded as the presumed strawman you are presenting._ Dude. Racism is the treatment of persons of another ethnic group as subhuman. The fact that people don‚Äôt like white people is not racism. It‚Äôs a consequence of years of racism. No one thinks white people are subhuman or treats them as such. There is only distrust and dislike, which arguably has its basis in real historical patterns of racist behavior from persons and peoples who happened to be white. That‚Äôs just not racism. It is fair the whites have to earn trust back after literal centuries of attempts to dominate the rest of the world through conquest, colonialism, conquest, and culture wars. Sorry it makes you uncomfortable, but everything we do as a people has direct consequences on the generations that come after us. So because of our ancestors, we have to rebuild trust. Let‚Äôs make it do our descendants don‚Äôt have to work as hard to earn it back._ @sarah4326¬† since you want to educate people, let us educate you since you dearly need it. Racism according to the English dictionary: prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior. Second context: the belief that all members of each race possess characteristics, abilities, or qualities specific to that race, especially so as to distinguish it as inferior or superior to another race or races.\nBased on the second part, you have announced yourself to be a complete racist.\nI am a white South African. So let me educate you a little about what I've learned from living in Africa. It doesn't matter what race you are, racism is a human trait. The majority will always discriminate against the minority and look after their own. We are the minority in this country. We have a quota system in my country, meaning that based on your race you cannot be employed, educate yourself or your children. This quota system means that since blacks outnumber whites 8 to 1 we must be represented thus, but we also have other minorities here as well. So basically 8 of 10 places in University must be given to black pupils first, regardless of matric results. The other 2 can be given to the minorities, but Indians are given preference to whites. So our kids can't be educated, not that they can get jobs after school since we have affirmative action. This means that all job openings must be offered to black South Africans first. Then Indians, then whites. Tell me again how whites can't be victims of racism? I am so in need of an education by an ignorant racist such as you. But we also have BEE, black economic empowerment. This means that all businesses and or upper management must be held by a significant percentage of black people. This effectively means no white owned business can apply for a tender or contract to a large company. Unless of course you take on a black partner and pay them 60% of your profits. Then our white farmers are attacked and brutally murdered, two year old children decapited and their heads used like soccer balls. A 4yr old boy is dragged 2km by hijackers who would not let his mother remove him from the back seat so they could steal the car she worked hard for. Or an 86yr old man is shot in the face while helping his disabled wife into the car. They drove off with her so that they could throw her from the moving vehicle.\nTell me again. When we do have jobs, our houses are broken into and our cars stolen, our women raped and our men disfigured and beaten before being forced to watch. Parents watching their teenage daughter being dragged off and raped while they are held at gun point in their home. And our government bans all black on white crime being reported on now. So please, I long to hear from someone like you that my people are not victims of grotesque and violent racism and hate crimes._ Sarah Aird just look up the definition of racism, wait.. lemme do it for you ‚Äúprejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior.‚Äù This says nothing about white people not included. It‚Äôs purely a belief that you are a superior race, and in doing so you are antagonizing or discriminating against someone else_ She's more racist than those she accuses._ But racism doesn't exist without white people; just ask any professor or read any textbook of liberal arts._ Prophet Muhammad said in his last sermon  :  \"‚ÄúAll mankind is from Adam and Eve, an Arab has no superiority over a non-Arab nor a non-Arab has any superiority over an Arab; also a white has no superiority over a black nor a black has any superiority over a white ‚Äì except by piety and good action\"_ The only racism in this country and around the world is Media induced propaganda racism.  Think about it, it all starts with the lying media. You see something on TV and right at that moment you start making assumptions without taking all the facts (thinking they are giving you all the facts) into consideration. The problem is assuming that the main stream media are telling the truth and not stopping to think twice that all they are feeding us are lies upon lies. I urge everyone to think back on a favorite story seen on TV, any story, and then realizing in a few days, months, years, or even decades that it was all bogus. I can think of hundreds. The problem with the economy is not the fake racism but monetary centralized banking system that, through fake media, wants us divided and dumb as they skin us of all our possessions and dignity.\n2017 Death Summary in NYC = 101,385\nhttps://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/vital_statistics/2017/table31b.htm\n5/06/2020 Death Summary in NYC due to Covid-19 = 19,174 ???\nhttps://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\n5/06/2020 Death Summary in NYC other than Covid-19 = no word about that anywhere ???\nInadvertently, those who modified corona virus and made it COVID-19 eradicated all other disease from the world.

Private clinics are treating people using this regimen with great success why not hospitals where ventilators actually suffocate people so its a terrible approach. And stop this crap about side effects. Look up any medication people take for other issues and the side effects are much horrendous than HCQ yet people take them like candy. I'll take HCQ's side effects over death anytime.\nCommon hydroxychloroquine side effects may include:\n-  headache, dizziness, ringing in your ears;\n-  nausea, vomiting, stomach pain;\n-  loss of appetite, weight loss;\n-  mood changes, feeling nervous or irritable;\n-  skin rash or itching; or.\n-  hair loss.\nThere may be some severe side effects like retinal damage but they occur in  people who take this drug in large quantities for a period of many years, and who already have lupus or malaria which contribute to those side effects. I urge people to study closely the side effects of HCQ and make up their own mind.\n\n1.  Hydroxychloroquine 200mg 2 x daily for 5 days\n2.  Azithromycin 500mg once daily for 5 days\n3.

You'll get little job security. Career prospects are pretty poor. It's highly competitive, so you'll probably have to sacrifice private life to get anywhere.

New batteries are bigger and to counteract the weight they don't use as thick a cover usually just a thick foil is sufficient when the user can't physically touch and damage it. Because of the high capacity and construction of newer batteries they are dangerous so get sealed away. Plus the majority of phones with non removable batteries are somewhat water resistant as the battery is for the most part kept well shielded._ Still don't understand how to change my battery which is built-in._ Those gloves are specially designed to be work with touchscreens.

Reminds me also of a book Lucky Planet by David Waltham. üëç_ What about having enough gas giants in the planet's solar system to protect the planet against regular asteroid impacts, allowing time for life to develop? What about the planet's solar system's position in the galaxy, as outer solar systems are less turbulent (fewer asteroids, fewer supernova gamma-rays, etc)? What about the condition of the planet's magnetosphere/if the planet has an active dynamo, won't solar radiation destroy life without it?

However, the wife in Matthew 5:31-32 is clearly not guilty of fornication because the Jews that Jesus was speaking to were still living under the law, and if fornication was discovered, there was a moral obligation to report the offender according to Deuteronomy 22:13-24. The wife, who would have been found guilty of fornication, was subsequently stoned to death, according to the law, which had still governed the Jews up until Christ's death on the cross. The same for a woman caught in adultery, according to Leviticus 20:10. How could a wife, guilty of fornication, or adultery, under the law of Moses, be given a writing of divorcement and be caused to commit adultery with whosoever marries her, that is divorced? Jesus is clear, in these examples, that the wife is not guilty of fornication, but is still caused to commit adultery if she marries another man now that she is divorced. This is the only way that Matthew 5:31-32, and Matthew 19:9 keep harmony with Romans 7:2-3, and 1 Corinthians 7:39.¬†\n\n\nUnlike the synoptic gospels of Mark and Luke, which were written to evangelize the Gentiles, Matthew was written to the Jews, and has of 24 characteristics that identify it as intended for the house of Israel.¬†\n\n\nThe ancient Jews called the betrothed (engaged) \"husband\" and \"wife\" according to Deuteronomy 22:23-24, Matthew 1:18-25, and Luke 2:5-7.¬†\n\n\nDeuteronomy 24:1-4 (Moses's precept of divorce and remarriage) was never for fornication or adultery. Allowing those guilty of fornication and adultery to remain living and become a prospect for remarriage was against the law of Moses in Deuteronomy 22:13-24 and Leviticus 20:10, which commanded that those who were found guilty of fornication and adultery be put away from Israel, and stoned to death.¬†\n\n\nThe law of Moses was not given to the world, only to the Jews. From the exodus, to Christ's death on the cross, the law of Moses governed the Jewish people. But when Jesus died on the cross, he caused the Jews to be dead to the law of Moses so they could be joined to Christ under a New Covenant. This is what Jesus's fulfillment of the law of Moses, including Deuteronomy 24:1-4 (Moses's precept of divorce and remarriage), means. Paul gave several warnings to Christian believers against keeping the law of Moses over following Christ and his commands under the New Covenant with Christ. Keeping the whole law is no longer possible for those in Israel and that is why Christ prophesied that the temple would be destroyed. These scriptures make it clear that if you choose the law over Christ, that you must keep the whole law: Romans 7:4, Galatians 3:1-9, Galatians 3:10-29, Galatians 4:1-7, Galatians 4:21-31, and Galatians 5:1-15.\n\n\nBeing unequally yoked to unbelievers is not a cause for divorce, once two become one-flesh in a covenant of marriage, according to 1 Corinthians 7:12-14. Many one-flesh covenant marriages between unbelievers are recognized by God in the scriptures, most notably the marriage covenants between Herodias and King Herod's brother Philip, Potiphar and his wife, Ahab and Jezebel, and Ruth to her deceased husband Mahlon by Boaz when he took her to be his wife.¬†\n\n\nSome are teaching that 1 Corinthians 7:15 implies that those who are abandoned by the unbeliever, are \"no longer bound\" in a one-flesh covenant of marriage. The reason this is in conflict is due to the way they word it, which gives it an entirely different meaning, and context. 1 Corinthians 7:15, says, \"15But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us to peace.\" As you can see, the actual scripture says \"not under bondage,\" which means that the husband or wife is not enslaved to sin with the unbelieving spouse, and is free to worship Christ in peace. Subsequent translations have changed the words to imply that they nullify the marriage covenant, when this is not at all the case. The issue that this creates is with 1 Corinthians 7:10-11, which says, \"10And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband: 11But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife.\" As you can see, those who claim 1 Corinthians 7:15 has the Apostle Paul giving permission to remarry do not understand that the abandoned husband in 1 Corinthians 7:11 is expected to also remain unmarried, in order to be reconciled with his wife. The theory that 1 Corinthians 7:15 nullifies two as being one-flesh in marriage puts the Apostle Paul directly at odds with Christ, by implying that he has issued an opposing command.¬†¬†\n\n\nSome also teach that 1 Corinthians 7:27-28 is referring to both divorced men, and virgin women, and not exclusively to men and women (virgins) who have never been married. This has been falsely taught for some time in churches as referring to anyone who is not currently in a marriage, which, for them, also includes those who are divorced. This is a very false assumption, and puts these verses in a different context, that is at odds with both the teachings of Christ and the apostle Paul. We see Paul refer to virgins, which signifies the unmarried who have never before been wed, which is the proper context here. We see Paul saying clearly that it is good for virgins, which is also speaking to never before wed men here, \"that it is good for a man so to be.\" He goes on to say, \"Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.\" Who is he referring to here? Men who, like himself, have never married. The word \"bound\", in these verses, is a clear reference to betrothal (engagement) and not to a one-flesh covenant of marriage. The ancient Jews were considered bound as husband and wife during the betrothal (espousal/engagement) before becoming one-flesh in a covenant of marriage, through consummation. This is affirmed by the context of the term \"bound\" seen in Numbers 30:14-16.\n\n\nThe Jewish couples in ancient Israel, who were betrothed (engaged) were also bound together until death, either by execution for fornication, or by other causes. Then Paul says, \"But and if thou marry, thou has not sinned\", which is who? The men who had never married in the congregation at Corinth. So he begins with verses 25-26 speaking exclusively to men that have never married. Paul then says, \"and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned\", which is speaking directly about virgin women who have never been married, within the congregation, not divorced women. Notice that verse 34 says, \"There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.\" Paul speaks plainly when he says \"there is a difference between a wife and a virgin.\" Paul goes on to say, \"But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry.\" This is speaking of a virgin who has become of age to bear children when it says, \"let them marry.\" This is a clear command, to a single man, who has taken a virgin to be his wife. Paul then says, \"Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.\" This is referring again to the single man who decides it is better not to marry, but to stay betrothed (engaged), under the present distress, by saying that he \"hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin.\" Paul then says, \"So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better\", which again means single men, in the congregation, who have betrothed a wife do well if they marry, and those who choose not to allow their virgin brides do better, under the current climate. For more proper context of the word \"bound\", let's look further down in this chapter to verse 39, which says, \"39The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord\" (1 Corinthians 7:39). For so long, these scriptures, between verses 25-38, have been twisted and used to enable divorce and remarriage, by wayward churches and teachers, and have caused many to stumble and to be trapped in unlawful unions.\n\n\nThe use of the woman at the well, in regard to marriage, falsely implies that Christ was endorsing remarriage after a divorce. This teaching is in defiance of Matthew 22:23-28, which shows a woman who had been widowed seven times, and entered into each subsequent marriage without any scriptural conflicts with God's law of marriage (one-flesh covenant) seen in Genesis 2:23-24.\n\n\nMark 10:1-12 is the same biblical record of Matthew 19:1-12, which both record Christ's teaching that day beyond the Jordan. There is no mention of the words \"fornication\", \"writing of divorcement\", or \"divorced\" in Mark's Gospel, because Mark was not written to the Jews (as Matthew's Gospel was), but to evangelize the Romans and Greeks, who had no knowledge of the law in Deuteronomy 22 or Deuteronomy 24. All of these facts draw a clear understanding that remarriage after a divorce, under the New Covenant with Christ, is a scripturally false and baseless teaching. Please use wisdom when living in any situation against what the scriptures command._ Sacrifice just a simple word. but? really not simple for the human life.\nThank You_ In a nutshell: think about marriage in terms of the contract that it is ...

That's why for example we have all these weird cultures that get created in every generation around dating & other kinds of wooing: the structure brings predictability & comfort because everyone has an agenda they can refer to & rate a partner on those criteria while making decisions. Today, with the traditional rules being largely discarded, it becomes an individual responsibility to make active considerations about what they want their relationship to look like & that needs clear & open communication.

You get married to signify that you and your significant other has become one(in a sense). You get married for love. But remeber love is not a feeling its a choice. You choose to love this person during the good and the bad. Love is hard work and there is no denying it. With the right person its worth dping all that work. But if you marry someone because of only a feeling it wont work. And if you dont want to put in some work in bettering the relationship then its best for you to stay away from it_ @Tyler Trobaugh Well there are many reasons that people dont feel like they are made for marriage because of all the stigmatism. Marriage has been built up to look like it would only affect your life badly. I mean we could go on for ages about how the \"social norms\" dictates people to live their life a certian way and if they dont they failed in life. People arent made to be pushed in a box. And most people view marriage as being put in a box. So the sad reality is that everything is screwed up in some way or another.

As a matter of full disclosure, my wife and I are perfectly matched in our respective second marriage.

Communication is everything. The way you plan and prepare for ‚Äúworst case scenarios‚Äù for like finances or losing a job, you gotta talk about and plan for the end of a relationship and in this way you avoid it happening. Relationships are extremely intentional_ This seems to need to be reframed in the context of fairness and respect, and not demanding too much of the other person.\n\nThe word divorce has heavy connotations that are probably dangerous to the emotions that bind the relationship. You can just say \"These are the kinds of things that lead to divorce, so how could you use that knowledge to avoid going down that path?\"\n\nThe marriage mediator idea...

Sorry, I have my own future relationship plans in mind._ @theoutlook55¬† There were several red flags, but I did not even recognize them as red flags until much later. They were mostly centered around little ‚Äùwhite lies‚Äù that seemed like nothing at the time and were easy to excuse or overlook, but were actually signs of much bigger mental/emotional/behavioral problems the person had.  \n\nFor example: he would lie about what he had done that day, say he had stayed home all day even though he may have gone out to run errands or something innocent. I wouldn't understand why he would lie about something so small, but he would explain it away as if he just forgot to mention it or didn't think it was worth mentioning. Then I would later find out whatever reason he may have really lied, like running in to an ex or something stupid that shouldn't be an issue to a  normal person, but to him was something to be kept secret, even though nothing happened between them.\n\nAlso, I had to explain to him every detail of every second of my day without hesitation or I was instantly called a liar. He was very jealous and wanted to control every moment if my time. If I was not at work, I was expected to be sitting by him, no matter what. \n\nHe had outbursts of anger regularly as well. Come to find out, he can't control his anger at all really and will blow up at the smallest things. He had more control in the beginning of the relationship and promised to work on it but it only got worse with time. \n\nBasically, anything that feels like a red flag to you should NOT be ignored. No matter how small or insignificant, it will most likely lead to bigger problems. UNLESS the person respects your opinions and feelings about it and changes their behavior that seems toxic. Every little thing I felt uncomfortable with or felt weird about ended up being a major issue that led to our overall demise. Trust your gut!!_ @cyndihunter6022¬† Thanks so much.

My parents are still married and in their nineties.  That means over 65 years of marriage!   As their eldest child, that marriage is a sham because it was full of violence and hatred which meant that all of the offspring have been casualties of that marriage.  It's not just about what each brings to the table.  It's not just as simple as that._ @thehorsebackheroine5950¬† \n\nI think you have misunderstood me.  I never said that long marriage and or simply staying together is the ultimate goal or indicated any sort of validity.  Just take a moment and look over what I said above carefully.   If two people care for each other even in the slightest, even when life happens because they care they can an will work through  it.  However one person can't do it on their own, both must care for each other.  ‚Ä¶and they must also care for themselves also.  CARE.

It is a life long project, a contract with contingencies, known and unseen. The key is maturity before marriage, but unfortunately, often the reverse is the case. Time would not wait. Haste is dangerous.\n\nThose who are married often envy the single. Those who are single envy the married. It is melodrama in general. It can be a fulfilment if you make a choice consciously knowing life is a personal deed but not a religion. There is no such thing as better than or lucky or not lucky.

Of course, I am trying to do humour here, no offence.

Because really... Fair is fair_ @michelemeka4540¬† Ah but each party has a different point of view based of there own need that they deem  fair from there unique perspective .

Sometimes it's that they got married too soon and realized they made a mistake, or they were fighting every five minutes, or one felt taken advantage of in one way or the other. More often than not, I'd see them keep score. Even when it came to things that weren't responsibilities, like gifts, they'd go back to their spouse and say \"Well I did this for you so you have to do this for me!\" or \"I don't have to take out the garbage; I got you flowers yesterday, remember?\" It all felt so petty. There'd be a fight every few minutes, yelling so many insults I wondered how they stayed married when it was clear they didn't even like each other. Fights were about winning more than they were reaching a healthy compromise. In the end, it'd tear them apart within just a few years. I feel like in many cases there was a mixture of unrealistic expectations, one feeling like they gave all the time while the other took, and a need to always want to keep score. I'm sorry your parents' marriage didn't work, but hopefully your life is better off for it. I'm not married yet, but I'm hoping that when I do find the right person, I can apply all I've learned and have a happy, healthy marriage._ I guess im asking randomly but does any of you know a tool to get back into an instagram account??\nI somehow forgot my account password. I would appreciate any assistance you can give me._ üíØ_ Or as I like to say don't marry at all, I am a lone wolf and always have been, I'm a person who enjoys my freedom, I feel marriage as a tie down as true freedom cannot be attained, reason for this is because if you don't marry in the first place you and your partner will not be corrupted or tainted with the man temptations and blame that's usually always associated with marriage and then only becomes a statistic. I always walk the path of the lone wolf and will continue to do so until the day I die, also marriage is only a piece of paper, if you truly love that person then be with that person, not because what laws or state dictate or define what a marriage truly is, no law can stop me or anyone else taking a partner in life. Wolves abandon their young after a certain while for a reason, so that way they can find their own path and their mate in life and no law governs them as they are truly the pinnacle of freedom!_ @ericcornish1983¬† I know both sides of the corn. Let's not associate freedom with marriage. People like to challenge that. For the religious marry vow devotees, that is their choice. Freedom is irrelevant to them. For the lone wolves, more power to them, because they understand life in its essential nature.\n\nWhen the cage door is open, the bird chooses to stay in.

Can we stop spreading the stereotype that women are born nutures! Because they aren‚Äôt. There are many men/fathers who are loving and nurturing, and many women who aren‚Äôt._ We need more moms in charge._ Thinking with only emotion and treating everyone like they are 5 years old is not a good strategy. Also, we have feminized and demonized men too much in our society. WE NEED MORE MEN WHO STEP UP AND ACT AS MEN (not be shamed into acting as women)! Now we have a war on men/boys or anything masculine!_ ‚úãüèªüëèüèª_ How about lets make it collectively?_ I see your point, and I thought about that too. Though she doesn't continue defining what she defines as \"mothering\" throughout the video, she does make a point of acknowledging this in the beginning. If this definition is hard to get past, don't let it get in the way of absorbing her deeper messages :)_ if you listen closely, she says that motherhood can be for everyone. it does not matter your gender, age, race. motherhood is for everyone. if you look beyond the title and watch the video, you would know that. so \"dont just look at the cover, always figure out whats in the book before you judge\" -unknown_ Most women are nurturing._ Yeahhhh so they can take some time off when they get pregnant or feel upset. Women are not born to lead._ James, your kind is going extinct._ Bad advice, you must think like a father._ Ah yeah, so during these times it's only the mothers that can help because anybody that isn't a mother, can't understand this way of thinking. In my experience its the mothers I see that are panic buying, overworrying, promoting drama and spreading fake news, so maybe don't think like them._ Remember that pregnant lady in Sri Lanka who blew herself up along with her three other kids in her house...?

Outside of the context of trauma, Oxytocin makes us more prosocial towards in-group members and more anti-social towards out group members. It exacerbates conflict. It makes you more closed minded and focused on your own biases. This women has no idea about established behavioural neuroscience. All well intended but misleading and is therefore exacerbating  disorientation. Foolish propaganda._ Toxic feminism_ My mother always said, 'think like a teacher, in uncertain times.' She was a teacher, so I guess you are right._ Great video but I have to say the title should say Think like a Parent because not all mothers are great. And this excludes fathers. Women often think that their gender is the most nurturing. Many ppl are and were raised by great Men\\Fathers while the mom was the dead beat alcoholic. Let us treat both genders equal please. \nAgain, great video.\n\n\nUpdate: I am not at all trying to take away any credit or whatever from the awesome moms out there. I just think the title could have been more effective if it didn't exclude fathers._ How beautifully inspiring !_ I loved the beginning, but then she had to pivot at the end to insult mothers who would make different choices than she would. She reminds me of the moms who shame other moms for their parenting choices. Can‚Äôt we be open to seeing that there are others who choose differently and think differently, but are still doing what they think is best for all involved? Insulting others didn‚Äôt add to her message. It was an unnecessary dig. \n\nYes, lovingly solving problems with everyone‚Äôs best interests at heart is exactly what needs to be done. Labeling and attacking straw-mothers is an easy appeal to a base, but it isn‚Äôt inclusive. It isn‚Äôt conducive to problem solving with solutions from all perspectives. \n\nWe need to remember that not everyone will share our points of view. That doesn‚Äôt mean we aren‚Äôt entitled to our points of view, but if we‚Äôre truly thinking like mothers, we should be open to the differences among us and truly embrace diversity, including ideological diversity. If your child is different than what you expected, do you love them less or do you choose to get to know them and understand them for who they are? Thinking like a mother means loving diverse people, even when you disagree with them, and treating their experience as valid, soothing concerns, and addressing reasonable expectations. That is how we get everyone‚Äôs needs met. Being a good mother starts with listening._ I literally read, in certain times, think like a monster. Was relieved to read the actual title. Or was I?_ People in the comments are making all sorts of completely baseless claims about her idea of \"thinking like a mother\", like, how hard is it to understand when she literally stands there and advocates for love, compassion, and a desire to protect and assist those in need to be the main influencers of decisions in times of crisis/etc, and see it as her advocating for stressing out, being overbearing, or sacrificing everything you have ?_ Oh please!_ Think like a mother? So worry to the point that you make yourself sick?_ Legit literally as its message itself_ aight, men got no feelings :(_ So is thinking like a father bad? In the world that i have observed, only fathers usually have a holistic view of a family, they put themselves last.

I am sure that the speaker didn‚Äôt want to offense dads but it is a sad truth even if there are great dads and bad moms_ Don't be this person..everything you said before your disclaimer takes away all the credit from womxn._ the woman says that motherhood is open to everyone. Motherhood is the care of a child, and it can be for everyone._ @sophiemartin1535¬† I don't wanna offend you but,, still, it's kinda opinion from women's side_ @tatendakatsumbe¬† Did it? Reads to me like he is just trying to share the credit between all who deserve it and not exclude a specific gender. That's the end goal, right?\n\n\nAlso, I may be unfamiliar with a common practice, but why did you write womxn instead of women?_ @sophiemartin1535¬† lol no. The family court system is designed to limit access by the father and to extract as much cash from him as possible. The vast majority of fathers just want time with their kids._ Because she's a feminist/socialist, they think that their opinion, the only correct one, is why \"political correctness\" is called so, because if your words don't coincide with what Karl Marx wrote, then they are incorrect.

Don't let your pimp hand grow weak or you will suffer the same fate as the west._ Using that logic, the title implies that love and compassion are exclusive to mothers.

I live in the US...what extreme atmospheric events have we suffered due to global warming? You say this but provide 0 examples._ @tevinvezina1766¬† I can't list exactly which atmospheric events are caused by climate change, because - surprise- if global warming impacts climate it is impossible to distinguish exactly which would have happened anyway and which happened only because different temperatures influenced winds and streams etc. Meteorology isn't all that precise, it mostly studies what already happened. But there is proof that extreme events have become worse and more frequent. read what https://nca2014.globalchange.gov/highlights/report-findings/extreme-weather said in 2014 about it: \"As the world has warmed, that warming has triggered many other changes to the Earth‚Äôs climate. Changes in extreme weather and climate events, such as heat waves and droughts, are the primary way that most people experience climate change. Human-induced climate change has already increased the number and strength of some of these extreme events. Over the last 50 years, much of the U.S. has seen increases in prolonged periods of excessively high temperatures, heavy downpours, and in some regions, severe floods and droughts. \" \"There has been a substantial increase in most measures of Atlantic hurricane activity since the early 1980s, the period during which high quality satellite data are available.,, These include measures of intensity, frequency, and duration as well as the number of strongest (Category 4 and 5) storms. The recent increases in activity are linked, in part, to higher sea surface temperatures in the region that Atlantic hurricanes form in and move through. Numerous factors have been shown to influence these local sea surface temperatures, including natural variability, human-induced emissions of heat-trapping gases, and particulate pollution. Quantifying the relative contributions of natural and human-caused factors is an active focus of research. \" I can't copy and paste their graphics, but you can check them out for yourself._ @tevinvezina1766¬† about Brahmaputra Delta: \"During the twentieth century, global mean sea level rose at an average of 0.07 inches (1.8 millimeters) per year. But from 1993 to 2003, that rate increased to 0.12 inches (3.1 millimeters) per year. Scientists attribute rising sea levels to expansion of the oceans as they warm, as well as to the melting of mountain glaciers and the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. Bangladesh, one of the world's most populous countries, is highly vulnerable to the effects of sea-level rise‚Äîincluding more salinization of both ground and surface waters. The deltaic plains of the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna rivers compose most of the country's land area, and the vast majority of the coastal zone is at an elevation of less than 16 feet (5 meters).\nLocal sea-level rise of as much as 1 inch (25 millimeters) per year has been recorded in sections of the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta.\" And: \"By mid-century, more than 3 million people stand to be directly affected by sea-level rise in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta. In a worst-case scenario, Bangladesh could lose nearly 25 percent of its 1989 land area by around 2100.\nClimate change is projected to cause further sea-level rise during this century and beyond. If we do nothing to reduce our heat-trapping emissions, global sea level is projected to increase some 23 inches (59 centimeters) over recent average levels by the end of this century.\nHowever, if we make significant efforts to reduce emissions, sea-level rise could be limited to about 15 inches (38 centimeters) by the end of this century. Recent evidence of higher rates of global sea-level rise suggests that these projections may be low. And regional variations in sea-level rise are expected to continue. In Bangladesh, the impact of sea-level rise may be worsened by other effects of global warming, such as variable precipitation, more frequent droughts and floods, and shrinking of the glaciers that supply water to the rivers of the delta. Reduced rainfall during the dry season, for example, can increase the salinity of rivers through encroaching seawater that moves upstream during periods of low flow. Human activities such as shrimp farming and damming of rivers are also expected to intensify the effects of sea-level rise. Dams can retain sediment that would otherwise replenish eroded or subsided land in the river delta. More dams are planned in Asia, which are likely to increase erosion as well as relative sea-level rise, and might worsen water shortages and extend the area affected by salinity during the dry months. With the added pressure of rising air temperatures, rice production in Bangladesh could drop by 8 percent, and wheat production by 32 percent, by the middle of this century.  Unless we act now to cut our heat-trapping emissions, and take steps to prepare for the warming already projected to occur in the coming decades, the food and freshwater supply of millions of people in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta is likely to be in danger.\" I was wrong about it already being taking away lands but this is the very near future._ @tevinvezina1766¬† Subsaharian countries examples, you say?Senegal, Mauritania, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Nigeria, Chad, Eritrea, Algeria and Sudan. https://www.wearewater.org/en/the-sahel-desertification-beyond-drought_318262_ @tevinvezina1766¬† if you don't believe me, I linked some of the sources I used, which have linked more extensive studies.

The same way that we in times of Corona we don't want to resolve the current social restrictions too fast to prevent us of being overwhelmed by a second wave of covid-19 deaths.

And I like how she said walls are symptoms. Although symptoms of a desease should be treated with patience, there is cases where aggressive measures have to be taken to prevent even worse symptoms. Even if that means causing less harmful otherwise not woulding have to acurred  other symptoms. So there is no good and bad for walls. There is good and bad for intention. And these have to be wisely balanced._ Walls certainly can protect. That‚Äôs why prisons have walls._ Yes, Israel should immediately tear down their wall. What a naive little girl. I wish I could live in her little made up Utopia._ Alaxandra Auer Lots of aspects there but I predominantly agreed at least we shouldn't separate the children even in school. You have done a fantastic work. I applaud your work and thoughts_ A mental wall can be removed, but let's keep the real walls up. Let's build more, in fact._ Fences do what they would fence against._ Alexandra, it was beautiful what you did for that school. It's easy to come here and call people stupid, but you presented your idea and gave space for the parents to share their opinions. Sure there are walls that mean something \"bigger\" and roots more complicated to deal with, but I think that there is really no problem to look at the problems and try to create something better out of it._ Sannidor whaaatttt?!_ I agree that walls are built because other walls are destroyed. I agree that in some cases walled neighborhoods are a necessity. However I disagree with your assumption that the cycle of walls is to some degree, inevitable. We must choose wether we see the cycle of walls as promoting the general welfare or not. Then, we must decide wether to change how we use walls. I would love to hear your view of the current usages for walls. Which walls you feel are justified, which walls you feel are useful, and why those walls are justified and/or useful._ Walls don't effect terrorism in any way but to encourage it.\n\nOtherwise nice opinion_ *Symbolising human opinion, against better evidence_ https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freik%C3%B6rperkultur\n\nClothing is preferable in the most settings /groups times and places but has always been optional (Ben Franklin advocated for \"air baths\" quite intensely)._ 50% of the people in Germany sit in prisons, because they were too poor to pay their bills, fees, whatever_ Israel should(or act less Fashist in deferent ways), these walls breed the contempt funneled into explosives like the Irish border did._ Hard to put down mental walls with physical ones limiting your possibilities for experience i guess..._ I hate it when ted gives a platform to stupid people to share their stupid opinions_ ‚Äúway back in WW2 they built a wall.... hey! Wasn‚Äôt that wall to separate one of biggest threats known to man- the Nazi‚Äôs? I think she should look at her own history!_ Yeah damn those useless walls. I just sit outside on the lawn during a hurricane_ This sounds like the onion talk about holes_ Yes i am totally agree with you.  We should not separate people.  If there is a problem we are called to take appropriate measures and end its roots._ I've honestly always seen walls as something you build with others. Let me explain because I have 2 examples\nSo, theres 2 parts to a wall. The wall itself and its foundation. There's 3 possible ways this could develop. A strong foundation, but weak wall. A weak foundation, but strong wall. And of course a strong foundation and a strong wall.\nMy friend, lets us call her Mia. Mia and I were in the same class for 3 years in total. Some day after I broke up with my ex called Emma we got very close. Mia and I had a weak foundation because we got close very very fast without knowing each others background story, so we skipped working on the foundation, but went straight for the wall. We to this day don't talk, and I've spoken more with her mom the past year than her. \nMy ex Emma. My ex Emma and I spent a long time working on the foundation, and showed our different sides fast. We became friends, and slowly but surely went to a romantic relationship. By that time our foundation was strong enough to be built on. So time goes by, and we end up breaking up. The wall is gone, but the foundation is there. I still speak to her regularly even after 3 years. With the wall being broken down we used the broken wall to build upon our foundation. \nYou could change the walls with towers, but honestly the same concept_ I thinks prisons holding terrorists should get rid of their walls since \"walls just provides us with a feeling of security\". 1:08\nPrecision is key sometimes_ Walls make it so you don‚Äôt have to kill quite so many people. \nThat wall in that school was protecting the Belgian kids from the Muslim kids. They will kill your precious little white kids._ Very glad we are building a border wall after living & working in healthcare in Southern CA & seeing what a true crisis illegal immigration is. I recently paid $1300 for healthcare for just me and my two sons, on a nurse‚Äôs wage (leaving me no money to invest in a home, etc), while thousands and thousands come over here a month or so before their babies are due to live with extended family & get a delivery paid by our hardworking taxpayers...many of whom can‚Äôt afford to have a baby their selves or pay for healthcare. These are not all ‚Äúrefugees‚Äù... not even close...many are just taking advantage of the overly politically correct, naive government in CA and laughing at us. Some people truly do not understand how bad the situation is (and really need to go live around it before they speak too much) & how it is common sense to finally do something about these issues. So thankful Trump takes this matter seriously! (And most of the Mexican people I know in CA totally agree...so people really need to quit projecting their hate/racism onto others)_ https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn41aCO8X8jgHkQBUxjvuwA_ It would be very good if you attached sub titles ‚ô•Ô∏èüíï I would understand every single word of the speeches_ #TRUMP2020   BUILDING THE WALL #KAG_ Just making shaite up on TED talks now._ Live your little utopian life.

Ask people of Louisiana..._ @tevinvezina1766¬† no it doesn't, that's ignorance again. Walls do not protect one from corona virus...

Men is in a narcissistic power trip, and I hope to be here to see the fall of mankind... I don't know when but IT WILL happen._ She is mainly talking about the mental wall, that is reinforced due to the physical walls. And no, this speech isn't about the walls of your house. \nWe, as humans, consider anyone and everyone we don't know, or as \"the others\" as bad. People live in gated communities because the people living outside the walls, are \"potentially bad\", she is talking about that mentality_ The hole's natural enemy is the pile_ Don‚Äôt separate people. Spread coronavirus. Great idea_ They are bullying more people into terrorism than keeping people safe from attack to begin with.\n\nOccupational training, reintegration and economic security help plenty but US implementation (making Californian inmates fight wildfires, prohibiting ex-cons from wildland firefighting) leaves things to be desired._ An interesting thing about prisoners in the US is that none of them can be forced to work at any job or go to school. Well there is an exception in some states. That is young offenders can be required to get their high school diploma or GED. But that is the same as people outside the fence lots of things like jobs can require a person has a high school diploma or GED. So inside the fence and outside are the same. People have suggested to me that paying the inmates is the same as forcing them. So, well maybe but in that case it is the same inside the fence and outside. Non inmates are forced to work so they can earn money to spend on things they'd like. Another perk for inmates in some or most all prisons is if they work there is a system in place that allows them to use that work as a work history that looks more like they were working for a staffing agency. This is very helpful for reintegration and the beginning of a better life.\nJust thought I'd mention that because it is about how people think about issues and that is what this video is about._ Melissa Hall \nRight on sister. üëç_ üéô‚¨á_ It's sad but it's true this TED talk was terrible_ Watch \"Let's talk about a question from my 5-year-old and a construction project....\" on YouTube\nhttps://youtu.be/2NV-Sihjwvw_ Watch \"Let's talk about a question from my 5-year-old and a construction project....\" on YouTube\nhttps://youtu.be/2NV-Sihjwvw_ @obsoleteoptics¬†  let's not and say we did_ Watch \"Let's talk about a question from my 5-year-old and a construction project....\" on YouTube\nhttps://youtu.be/2NV-Sihjwvw_ Who's more likely to react aggressively to a disagreement, children or adults?

It is sad to know these days that most children are taught and brought up to always think and know that walls are the best thing, when in reality they're only obstructions to the real problem or root of the problem that needs to be overcome._ Watch \"Let's talk about a question from my 5-year-old and a construction project....\" on YouTube_ Thank you Alexandra - formidable talk_ Let's remove all the fences_ Please guys can you share with us what are you doing during this period. \n  And please suggest something interesting for me to do .

Autistic people have very limited understanding when interacting socially. It affects their lives negatively._ I'm autistic and working on my biochem degree. Patterns help me with this all the time, but explaining what I see when answering questions is very difficult. People will try to be mean to put you in a place they expect people to be and it makes me sad and afraid of certain types, but I've found it easier to recognize the good ones, and how to be a good one to others. The world needs people who see it differently and we're a big part of that. You are so lucky to be a part of such a good family. My life would've been different with that. You are so brave getting up there with all those screens. I like your pictures. Your hair is cool. Good work. Thank you._ I'm autistic and 47 and so very tired of masking._ What a beautiful story! You are so sweet. Thank you for sharing._ Look, if I produce computers and 1% of them works differently I will call them defect and if not repairable then you must accept that they are a waste of resources and recycle_ 24 years ago,I cried my heart out upon learning my child has autism and ventricular heterotopia in the brain where producing and understanding takes place. No speech until 5 years old. No eye contact. At 3 years old, my child changed the password of the computer. She ordered 100 pieces of Christmas greeting cards. She also got in touch with a realtor, and typed she wants a bigger house, now! Later on, she ordered a dog fence. I mistook her silence as being mute and unable to understand. So I tested her, She correctly pointed at an apple for the letter A, B for ball. You get the idea. At 6, she can subtract large double digit numbers. The developmental neurologist asked me how looking at a clock helps her do math. Se is now an adult. She lives in an apartment by herself, and working. She drives a manual transmission car, and coordinates her doctors‚Äô appointments. She enjoys parties with friends who are also in the spectrum._ I think this man is right.

I am a nice person though but when I get triggered I lose control. It has been this way since I was a little kid. I'm finally nearing a diagnosis which gives me a lot of hope that maybe I will see improvement but until then I feel very low. I think the self esteem issue is a massive one with neurodivergence since most people don't understand the wavelength I'm on at any given time. Got a therapy session soon, they're giving me extra sessions now until I can get diagnosed._ Autism always existed. We just didnt have a name for it. We just thought \"they're different\" or \"weird\"_ I think he's just an introvert, and he doesn't relate to extraverts.

Just because you think that doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre correct. Autism isn‚Äôt defined by how it looks to you. He‚Äôs literally diagnosed, you can look it up. What a weird comment._ I do agree Autism isn't anything to cure but I struggle with as a mother of two autistic boys, there is a wall up between us I want to connect on the level other mothers get to with there kids emotionally and its a very lonely experience to love your children so much but its like they are stuck in the baby phase where you are waiting for the day they talk and tell you what there thinking and let you into there mind but it never comes, so many parents look into there baby's eyes and say I cant wait till you can tell me what your thinking and there is so much anticipation for that wall to come down , but it can become serious like them being able to tell me what happened at school or nursery,  My 6 year old has come home from school with scratches on his face and I ask him how did you hurt your face? and its silent I show him it in the mirror and ask when did you hurt your face? and he cant tell me I have to call up the school so they can tell me there version of my sons day I just wanna hear it from him instead of having to trust someone else's version of events I want to know how he feels if he is upset or scared when he thinks about it I want him to rant at me and give me the name of the child that did it , I find out another kid hurt him but they cant give me a name  I want to comfort him and ask him how he feels about it, I cant. I walk outside with my kids talking the whole time and its like I'm talking to myself and they are out of control and I get looks, I look crazy, I look like a bad mum,  but other parents have there children telling them everything that pops into there head as they walk and its a lot to be constantly reading body language and trying to work out my idea of what they are thinking and nothing will stop them reaching out at the road and pulling with there full body weight or trying to open every parked car we walk past or trying to hug or grab strangers as they pass no mater how many times I tell them to walk with me nicely its like they are aware of me at all and mad at me for not letting them touch the cars. when does it get to the point where they can understand you and you can understand them to the point its not pure chaos I could literally say to my son NO don't swing on the Curtin it will make the bar fall of the wall and hurt you and he will keep trying to do it like he cant hear me over and over and even when it does come down and he falls,  he doesn't learn and is still trying to climb and ignoring me saying no when I fix them its like he isn't conscious yet ._ He did such a wonderful job at explaining Autism in layman‚Äô terms. He was well spoken, entertaining and enlightening. Thank you for helping me to understand autism more. ‚ù§_ As a 39 year old woman who is just figuring out that I am autistic (my late brother was the first to tell me, but I refused to listen), I am actually blown away by my reaction this kids‚Äô talk. He reminds me of every boy I became friends with in my teens and 20s. I ultimately chose to spend my time with non-autistic, controlling, extroverted men. After years of pretending to be an extrovert, this talk is making me sad. I miss being myself._ I didn‚Äôt got it_ I got autism.

I  love that he's sharing his experience. I  agree, I think we need more awareness and knowledge about autism.\nI know that working with individuals with autism has made be a more empathetic and kind person.

But cognitive empathy may not seem as obvious with her but she definitely has feelings of empathy. There are times she's very deeply empathetic towards adults even when they try to hide it. But she doesn't have the impression management down, but, she's charming, people usually say that about her._ Speak the truth!!!!üíôüíô_ He is a pale white guy with a monotone voice who says that‚Äôs not the criteria , ironic_ Good talk._ It's a language and sensory discrepancy. \nWe don't always express things in a way that non-autistics expect, and our directness is often perceived as rude even if we mean well. This can create conflicts, and if we aren't aware we are autistic, it is really distressing to figure out why there is a conflict when we meant to help._ amen brother._ i mean why would people cry, its like your just making it seem bad when in reality its just him explaining how he experience his surroundings. To me its just disrespectful because he isnt trying to sound sad_ His point was that not all autistic people fit that criteria. Women and people of colour are diagnosed less not because they are less likely to have autism, but because the diagnostic criteria were historically based on studies of white boys, leading to biased assessments that overlook how autism presents in other groups._ The empathy misconception is frustrating. What scenario can you think of where empathy is on full display? Therapy. Person-centred counselling theory suggests six required conditions for therapy to be successful. Feeling empathy is one of them. Another is communicating that empathy. Autistic people do not lack the sensation of empathy for other people. They struggle with communicating that empathy to others. That may be for several reasons, but one common issue is that autistic people have difficulty recognising emotions in the faces of other people. Others may even struggle to maintain eye contact at all, which makes reading someone‚Äôs face very difficult. How can you tell what they are feeling by facial cues, if you can‚Äôt even look at them? Some autistic people may find intense emotions overwhelming. In some way it ties into physical sensory problems. They FEEL to a stronger degree in all things, when compared to neurotypical people, and this may make regulating oneself challenging.\n\nAll this to say that autistic people are just as empathetic as other people. They simply experience it in a way that may be less compatible with non-autistic people._ And taught me many Marvel's things_ iPhone chat GPT absolutely brilliant for helping me to open up and talk,_ Agree, thanks !_ Autism is only considered a disorder because of the population ratio.  If there was 99% of the people who were on the spectrum, those 1% who are not would be considered to have a disorder‚Ä¶ And those on the spectrum could then be called the normies.  Food for thought‚Ä¶_ Funny how I cant easily handle loud noise unless I have control over it. Like I can be a sound engineer but its harder to goto a show where someone else is mixing.

I am PROUD to be autistic because it has given me so much._ This is really awesome_ Thank you for sharingüòä_ We are simply very intelligent and are way head of the neurotypical people.

Good to know._ having the ability to maintain friendships and a job are considered disqualifiers for an autism disorder diagnosis, so think of all the autistics living as non functioning retards because other wise the government won't help them._ I want to ride the bus or train to anywhere i could walk to._ as someone who is autistic im 26 and I still feel like i dont belong in this world, but being autistic doesnt make you any less human ‚ù§_ Look, this is bullshit. Autistic people DO lack Empathy, How do i know? cause I have autism, and I know how we live, socialize, think and learn. 5:41_ Are you sure_ @JolinHard¬† Yes, I am sure, cause I lack empathy, when my father got married got remarried, I didn't feel joy or excitement I just felt the same since always_ @TheMedievalKeys¬† thats just one incident. I bet you can name a bunch of other times that you did use empathy._ As someone who also has autism... you don't speak for every autistic person.

I do lack that, I hope you have more freedom and expression that others_ Some of the quotes from the ted talk of the comments resonate with me so deeply. It feels‚Ä¶ validating._ We are all different we are. I have server autism, I draw cartoons, I'm old fashion, I am a kind, friendly, and polite young man. But the truth is I have mental health problems like anxiety, depression, troubled thoughts telling me I done something wrong, but the truth in the real world I didn't, I need to have  reinsurance from my mom and my stepdad. The truth is in my I like to be calm and sometimes be worried, it is like the behaviour circle, or more the Billy circle. When I had mental health problems I thought I was abuse by a paedophile but the I wasn't. And things turned to me and thought I was a paedophile and I was very very scared and upset and made me think ' have I done something wrong to my nieces and nephew, are they're scared me? And that the thoughts like to be nasty to me. But I would never in my life assaulted any living soul, I had a brilliant childhood with caring parents, brother, step siblings and my family. That is I have to remember. My life with autism is just how it is, when I was younger I never understand most things what's going on in the real world, but when I was 16 and turned 17 the is when the metal health started. In my leaving PowerPoint from my old school which is a special needs school, I wrote down telling every that ' if you have metal health problems, don't bottle it up! Please go and speak to a specialist that will help you.'_ I am now 14 turning 15, i got diagnosed with Autism officially on the 22nd of June 2024, i was not sure on how i was suppose to feel about being diagnosed with Autism as its not a Bad thing but i was simply confused on how i was to suppose to feel, will my friends see me diffrently now?  I was Officially  diagnosed  with High-Funcintioning Autism._ I was diagnosed in the late 70's . \nOriginally I was put in a home for spastic s as they used to call us.üòï. Anyway when I see people being bullied or picked on I get really upset, so I step in to stop the abuse but then I get in trouble lol.\nAnyway I just want to be treated like I treat others üòë_ \"autism as part of the natural human spectrum\" üåÖ_ I have the dur dur too_ As a lifelong autistic his words made perfect sense to me. I have a registered I.Q. of 167 and yet cannot do math to save my life. I am, however, quick to work things out, am especially good with tactical situations in video game environments, yet perversely cannot walk down the street without being overloaded by the sheer wall of noise that other people create. I find others intimidating, even annoying and loud noises make me want to scream. This sensitive hearing which is often linked with autism is known as hyperacusis._ We don't lack empathy, we lack understanding._ Autism people are the new kind, the humanity is an evolution towards new . The salvation of the world is the autistic society.üòÖ_ Well said Ethan! I have ASD & can relate to so much of this. You're right - the world just isn't built for us - which is why we get overwhelmed & frequently suffer burnout. \nI also agree - autism is a difference not a disease. Sadly, it is the same kind of mentality that used to think of homosexuality as a disease. We just are decades behind on the neuro-divergent issue._ I went on stage to sing and could not sing. Could not even say one word. He is so great to do this. Talk to a crowd_ this almost made me cry , late diagnosed  fermale with HF autisim. Master of Masking , bursting inside  of pain and sadness. Depression and low self esstem  never being good enough for the world. You fully fully aware you sick and its the mental illness not your fault being different but  the world gives you s*** all the time. Blames you  for everything what not cant deal with. Why the World online  is often my only safe space to have friends_ You did well, brother._ The thing is I'm exactly what people think autism is. No one likes me cause I need to change some things about myself but I don't know exactly what I need to change cause noone tries to be specific like what am I saying that's offending others_ ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt tolerate loud noises‚Äù\n\naudience proceeds to clap and cheer loudly \n\nDon‚Äôt get me wrong, I was sitting here clapping for this young man myself. I just found it to be darkly funny how our immediate response is to be super loud, all directed towards a man who doesn‚Äôt like sounds_ This kid is spouting incredibly unhelpful, ignorant, even dangerous sophistry fueled by his privilege. He speaks from his relatively ableist privilege over people with autism who are non-verbal, can't take care of themselves, even engage in self-injurious behavior. He also speaks from the privilege of having grown up in a world where there is general awareness of, acceptance of, and accommodations made for autism, ADHD, and other hidden disabilities. Those of us who grew up in the 80s and earlier had to fight hard for the legal protections he enjoys. We had teachers who believed there was \"nothing wrong with us\" except we were \"lazy\", \"poorly behaved\", \"chose to act weird,\" etc. Getting legal protections and accommodations required first getting our disorders recognized as legally protected disabilities, and even after that, even now, there are teachers and employers who think things like ADHD are \"just an excuse.\" His misguided rhetoric unwittingly emboldens deniers._ And i proud of you_ In all post soviet countries autism is considered as a disease. It  REALLY is. I can see what challenges,  suffers, meltdowns experiences my 9 year old girl and I am totally moved at seeing all this. I am doing my hardest to help her, but sometimes I have to rely  only on medicine._ People with Autism have unique abilities which are sometimes mislabeled as disabilities._ People sit there, applaud the talk, and then they still go and instictively exclude, dislike, or punish autistic people for being \"weird\"_ Level 1 autistic person here, I totally agree with you!_ 3:19 and 9:46_ Well, that's 10 minutes of my life I'll never get back. Brutal_ am I really diseased if I just think differently~ That one reached my heart! I am diagnosed as adhd... but this sounds the same as what i go thru!_ I‚Äôve dated a girl for 7yrs she has autism and it took me the longest to finally come to effective communication so her and i can have a better understanding on how she‚Äôs feeling, what‚Äôs going on with her work etc. This video has by far been the best explanation on how someone with autism thinks and goes about their day to day ü§ù_ Love it brother !_ Ethan is such a sweetie ‚ù§_ Fascinating talk, what an incredibly brave young man_ Different not less._ Well done Ethan! Thank you. ‚ù§_ Well I would think level 3 autism  people would like to at least get to level 1 to be high functioning._ I stim, I rub my hands and sometimes rub my fingers, and ppl will look at in disgust and say \"what are you even doing?\" Even my own mother_ And they all think everyone who's Autistic is the same, it's not, so many insults Autistic ppl, me beig Autistic and seeing ppl have fun on tiktok, and Instagram and ppl will comment stuff like \"are you r\" or \"are you acoustic?\" Like that's an insult._ I am in a special ed unit, and when i was in year 6 (yr 9 now tho) the teacher put this on, for me and my friends who have autism, and we all related to it ‚ù§‚ù§_ Amazing Ethan‚Ä¶thank you for your wonderful talk!‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§_ I like this kid._ The take away message i get from all these things is it's fine if you find that one thing you're good at and others appreciate you for but what if you don't or you find an interest/ expertise for something that's irrelevant for the job market.  What then?  I'll tell you what then, chronic depression and non-existent self esteem._ 7:00 The autism community supports you bursting when you are happy._ Your presentation was really good. Thank you for the insight into what it is like to live as an autistic person. I learned a lot._ Good Job Dude =) I am proud of you\n\nI am 32 years old with mild autism aspergers and add i am on aspergers and autism forum and i am proud to be autistic =) I take cbd daily and my cbd helps me to feel relaxed and better. I graduated from high school in 2010 and i have had a full time job for 2 years now so i have accomplished a good amount already in my life.\n\nFeel free to ask me anything.\n\n=)_ many people stim! with cigarettes! this bad habit is often times a self medication method for something and the added nicotine addiction just makes it that much harder and worse for you_ I am SO GLAD I found this video in my feed. I am learning SO MUCH and it is SO HELPFUL!_ I personally think some stars still get biased too._ Autism, simply put, is observable evolution. I dislike the term \"disorder,\" as I am debilitated only by other people and how they receive me. Autism spectrum divergence seems to suit us better._ ‚ù§_ I even have empathy for inanimate  objects.üòä_ First, he deals with the stereotype of autism, then says it is wrong. After this, he does an excellent job of proving that the stereotype is true, even though it isn't. \n\nAs an autistic person, the phrase \"the world isn't built for autistic people\" really angers me. The world is not built for any individual. People have to compromise and make the best of the world around them. \n\nEveryone is masking. Everyone has their public persona and their private persona. That is partly how community life is possible. Imagine a world in which everyone's inner thoughts and desires were in the open. \n\nI, too, have issues with load noises, which sometimes make me want to run and hide. I do not, though, expect others to live their lives in a way that does not affect me. I am a maximalist in interior decoration. A friend of mine is a minimalist, and I know because they tell me that they they hate my home, which they find stressful. Do I change to accommodate them? I do not, of course, why should I? \n\nI have never had a desire to stim. Hardly any of the autistic people that I know do. Yet he makes out that this is how autistic people cope. No, it is not. It is another stereotype. Some do, some don't.\n\nAutism is a spectrum. Get 100 autistic people together, and you have 100 different life experiences. In my opinion, even those not diagnosed with autism are on the same spectrum. After my late diagnosis, I was 58, friends asked what it meant to be autistic. When I tried to explain, hardly anyone did not comment that there were aspects of autism in their lives.\n\nI have watched several TED Talks about autism, and I'm sorry to say that not only is this the worst, but I do not feel that it helps the autistic cause._ Oh my goodness....what...a sweetheart! One only has to look into his eyes and really listen to see how much feeling is inside him! Thank you SO much wonderful young man- for educating me! I am not autistic, as far as I know, but loud amplified music makes me VERY anxious too, so I can't imagine how much worse for someone autistic._ You see one person with autism on stage talking and you've only seen one person with autism._ i LOVE his hair!!_ I really understand the empathy but can't show it, and quite sad when I get called out for it. And I mask like a pro!_ 6:34 The way he said woohoo reminded me of Willy WonkaüòÇ_ The way he carries himself on stage is exactly the same way I do. A little awkward, fully outside the comfort zone but somehow pulls it off._ Normal people are so slow in thinking,,, very emotionals and don't have logic or reason., is very frustrating._ im a 16 year old with autism. thank you so much for making this._ With ps an xbox, it could be like Iphone and android phones or Macs and PCs._ I agree that it's not a disease. However, it is a disability or disorder. I have sensory processing disorder, and I believe I'm on the spectrum. The social effects are profound for many. It's a  spectrum. So, some of it is very hard on families. Also, I firmly believe that certain aspects might be caused or worsened by infection. I'm not alone. Look at some of the research. I'm talking NIH, too._ ‚ù§_ The Reality of Autism._ As a person with autism, this video helped me learn a lot more about myself_ It's so cool to see another autistic people and how we all have different experiences and_ also linux and windows_ I remember my Older sister told me that I had autism when I was 12 and my mom than confirmed it. At first I felt less human and made me realize how different I was are me. I'm 22 now and as time goes on, while I still have stuff from my autism (my obsession with certain things, having a hard time communicating with others, and feeling ackward) I'm constantly reminded on how far I've come. I'm a college student with a decently paying part-time job at a warehouse, I can go out without anyone helping me, I spend a few days alone by myself, I feel more comfortable with who I am. I still struggle of course with certain things, but I can still manage it. I may think differently from others, but I'm human as much as anyone else. With or without autism_ Thank you,thank you,  sir_ I have autism it‚Äôs Great_ Like that üòé‚úåüèº\nP.S.: me too._ I mask subconsciously online a lot of the time so whenever me or a friend brings the fact that I'm autistic up to people who don't know,\nthey always say \"theirs no way, your lying\" or \"really? Your really good at hiding it.\" or something like that. In the real world, I usually mask,\nbut at this point everyone at my school already know I have Asperger's so their really isn't a need for masking at school, which I find nice.\nPlus since everyone already know, the ones that don't who try to discriminate against me will get shot down. Although at work I have to mask,\nand I obviously can't unmask in formal settings, that's common sense._ There‚Äôs a reason autism is a disorder. It‚Äôs not just, ‚Äúa different way of seeing the world‚Äù like a cute quirk. The world isn‚Äôt built for most people, catering to a small disordered group just isn‚Äôt realistic or reasonable. People with autism also do lack empathy, cognitive empathy specifically. The guy in this video just seemed to be trying to justify how autism somehow makes people special and unique when it doesn‚Äôt. Everyone has their issues, just live your life. Either way some people will like you and some won‚Äôt._ I've got a friend with autism and adhd, he's a really funny guy and he told me to watch this video cause he couldn't explain it. Wow_ We are unique. Autistic or not, we all are different. The more we come to accept our individual differences, and realize we have more in common than differences, the better the world would be_ Hello, befin using external regulation of emotion until its internalised. You will refain normal neurotransmitter levels. Fix fhd srimulation problems. Do the work and he autistic will gain any practice until internalized! You are alrady perfect, you beautiful, you are able to gain facial composure and be able fo use normal expressions. You hace to practice!_ If that was me, I would explain everything why it's not real_ üëèüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩ_ Im watching this after having some burnout today. Thank you for sharing. I feel less alone because of you sharing your story._ \"I get easily overwhelmed by loud noises\"\nthe crowd: \"WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! CLAPCLAPCLAPCLAPCLAPCLAPCLAP\"_ I must express that society is not hard only at neurodivergent people, but to any different people at all. If there's a bit more innatentive person, it'll be judged and there will be professors and many people trying to make it be a bit more \"attentive\", when it could be tiredness or many things. We fail to respect anyone necessities, is it just a bit more naive person or an autistic person. If we could learn to respect other's needs and be a bit more attentive and kind to anyone around us, there would not be a big deal to be neurodivergent or to be a person at all._ Great video!_ Thank you so much for this Ethan you are amazing!!!_ I'm an autistic woman with an adult autistic son. That makes me want to hug you and be your friend!_ my son was recently diagnosed on the spectrum. I'm trying hard to learn how to communicate better with him and make him more comfortable. this video gave me an insight on what he may be feeling_ you just explained emotions in a way ive never been able to do and its how i feel._ For a lot of the autistic people here, what were you like as a child & do you remember your childhood vividly & what you experienced?_ Certainly not leas human, I hope you don‚Äôt feel like that. So many neurotypical people, especially of your age, go through essentially the same sort of feelings and growing pains as you described. Autistic or not, the human experience is largely the same and anyone can feel like a misfit (don‚Äôt mean it in a bad way) at any time in their lives._ And next for the bravery award a member who suffers from autism making his contribution all the more valuable\n\nWe will put the cheering through the loudspeaker system so he knows we-\n\n\nKevin: NOOOOOOO_ IKRüòÆ_ Because they know he is going to say something great_ I appreciate this sentiment._ My first memory was being 8 months old then I experienced in and out on consciousness. Experiencing some parts of my early life in great detail and can remember it like yesterday, but other parts I can‚Äôt remember any of it._ I have talked to many parents of real kids with autism, and see people that actually have autism and the struggles they face. But thanks to social media, and the fact doctors have made autism a catch all term, people that don‚Äôt have it like to claim they do. It‚Äôs detrimental to those that do have it, because it spreads false awareness, and takes resources, as well as makes people have the wrong ideas. Many parents of real autistic children tell me how horrible it is to have someone go on and on about their autism, and all the things they are doing, when they themselves will be a caregiver to their child the rest of their life. There are different levels now, because it became a catch-all, but it sucks to see all the people these days claim they are when they aren‚Äôt. But I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs pushing awareness, he did a really great job. üëç_ This is one of the best perspectives on autism I have seen. I  have autism and was diagnosed pretty late (at age 22) and it's been really difficult to explain what it's like in a succinct way. This guy does an excellent job, and its much appreciated_ Brilliant talk and lovely hair üòé_ 1:09 what was that?_ This is the most important video that I have ever seen..._ I can activate empathy_ Autism is massively over diagnosed. And in my view there are massive downsides to \"getting a diagnosis\" and conceptualising yourself in such psychological terms. You are better off just reading some Samuel Johnson, Marcus Aurelius and William Shakespeare if you want some \"coping mechanisms\" / wisdom about life. If you are able to articulate yourself to a youtube audience then your \"autism\" diagnosis is probably not worth the paper it is written on._ I spent my whole childhood trying to understand people and tried so hard to find friends. Looking back now I realized I monologued ALOT, and I also had a hard time understanding metaphors at first, I couldnt tell who liked me and who didn't, etc. I talked alot, hoping someone would be interested im the same things as me. I got called a Walking Encyclopedia. But i never lnew what Autism was till the last couple years. Literally. Better late then never._ Thank you_ I'm not diagnosed with autism but I relate to many things he said_ In a world where businesses will pay for \"diversity\" that you can see (though we claim we are all equal despite how we look) it's interesting how deeply judgments are passed for the differences that truly lie within - such as autism._ ‚ÄúAutism and other mental conditions‚Äù??? Isn‚Äôt autism neurological not mental_ My boss has autism and so does his son and they are by far the most driven people I‚Äôve met_ i think the xbox-playstation comparison summed it up almost perfectly_ I hate it . . . If I a cure existed I would take it._ I love this.. such a beautiful soul, I enjoyed watching it! ‚ô•Ô∏è_ I find that autism is not just something that you struggle with but something that is intriniscally fascinating. If environements could just be a little better adapted to autistic peoples' predispositions I'm sure it could be far more widely seen as a blessing._ üòä your first clue that he has autism is the lack of consistent eye contact with anyone. if you notice the way his eyes bounce downwards or like he‚Äôs gazing at the wall in the back of the room between people, huge credit for being able to do that cuz i still stare out the window to avoid eye contact with my therapist._ Just got diagnosed at 26 , I understand myself more but the world now seems weirder ü§£I just stay inside and paint hahahah_ Thank you for explaining this so well_ You sound like a autobot\n\n*makes transformer noise\n\n\nAutobot empathy activated_ ü§®_ Ok but can you articulate yourself to some bitchesüò©_ Did you know the first person to ever be diagnosed with autism died around 1 week ago?_ They mean almost the same thing_ Make a person with autism feel comfortable, safe, and then give them a gift. You are welcome. Most sincere, biggest joy ever._ ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like loud noises‚Äù- audience claps loudly and shouts at end üëÄ_ One thing I always think is, please stop screaming. If I do something great, why on earth are you screaming? It's annoying and hurts my ears. I just thought that at the end when they clapped_ Sorry for this but i cant keep this unsaid... \"When people think of autism, they think of a whi5e male talking in a monotone voice...\" Said the white male in a monotone voice... (I rlly thought he was about to unleash his real normal voice in not a monotone tone) Forgive me for the comment, it just made me roll laghing... Im autistic too though_ Thank you, Ethan. Thank you a lot. You made an inspiring speech. You are loved by everyone ‚ù§Ô∏è_ This helps me to understand the autistic kids I've been looking after... I wasn't really getting what they were doing before._ Being an ugly social misfit is what it's like._ Fantastic talk - really insightful. Thank you!_ I get overwhelmed with choices, i literally freeze up_ This has school ______er vibes._ Everyone has to have a label these days._ I have long hair and I want his hair style_ I got this herbal supplement from Dr Oyalo channel and used it on my son for 4week and within the period of using it there was positive changes which really urge me to continue and I can say my son is free from autism now as his speech and social skill has improved_ üëèüèæüëèüèæthAnkyou 4 the speech_ Why give the big reveal at all?_ We should examine the possibility that autism is linked to sleep disorders.  There may be a link between autism and poor sleep.  It has been found that during sleep, the brain draws links between knowledge (what we learned that day) and the practical application of that knowledge (how to use that knowledge in everyday life).  The practical application of knowledge seems to be impeded in people with autism; that is, they have knowledge of facts, but lack \"common sense\" in applying that knowledge in practical ways.  Example: They may know that 1 dollar is made up of 100 cents.  But they don't really understand how that dollar is spent (in one case, an autistic man believed a car cost $1 dollar).  They have knowledge of facts, but not the practical application of that knowledge.  The lack of the practical application of knowledge could be the result of poor sleep, since sleep is when the brain assesses the practical application of the knowledge it has learned._ One thing I don‚Äôt understand is that most autistic people are highly intelligent but they also find it difficult to learn._ uh oh_ I have a friend in my class who has mild autistic traits and I can see that he masked himself that no one knew he is autistic._ Enforced etiquette in public will sure help us out.

There‚Äôs nothing to hint at anything related to that_ @therealmarkzuckerberg¬† Clues & observations are not your thing._ @bobbybacon3478¬† No, I understand what you are hinting at, I just want to hear your explanation on why you think this man gives off school shooter vibes._ sometimes i wonder how people like you function without freaking out that everyone near them is probably a school shooter jihadist from the Taliban or whatever because they speak in a weird way_ I got this herbal supplement from Dr Oyalo channel and used it on my son for 4week and within the period of using it there was positive changes which really urge me to continue and I can say my son is free from autism now as his speech and social skill has improved_ I got this herbal supplement from Dr Oyalo channel and used it on my son for 4week and within the period of using it there was positive changes which really urge me to continue and I can say my son is free from autism now as his speech and social skill has improved_ I got this herbal supplement from Dr Oyalo channel and used it on my son for 4week and within the period of using it there was positive changes which really urge me to continue and I can say my son is free from autism now as his speech and social skill has improved_ I got this herbal supplement from Dr Oyalo channel and used it on my son for 4week and within the period of using it there was positive changes which really urge me to continue and I can say my son is free from autism now as his speech and social skill has improved_ Because they can only really focus and put their full power to strength on their special interest_ 1:09 lol listen carefully_ I kind of pity him because he was isolated._ And everyone around him thought he is acting oddly because they don't understand._ I got this herbal supplement from Dr Oyalo channel and used it on my son for 4week and within the period of using it there was positive changes which really urge me to continue and I can say my son is free from autism now as his speech and social skill has improved_ Thanks for your suggestion_ @kmy3272¬† bro its a scam bot trying to trick you into buying dangerous substances dont do it_ @multilangcoder8723¬† no worries, actually I never thought of buying ,cuz there is no cure to autistism_ I got this herbal supplement from Dr Oyalo channel and used it on my son for 4week and within the period of using it there was positive changes which really urge me to continue and I can say my son is free from autism now as his speech and social skill has improved_ What a beautiful soul this young man is._ im autistic and this is EXACTLY it, very well explained_ im autism too.

Your perspective and experiences helped alot . THANKYOU SO MUCH wishing a bright journey GOD BLESSü•∞üòçüíñ_ My take on the subject is different: I like to think of my autism as a disease, not because it's factually true, because it isn't, but because the consequenses of living with the disability are like if you had one: you can't have a normal working situation, not a normal partner life, not form normal friendships, not have a normal emotional life, not a normal food and sleep routine, it's a life in shame, guilt, anxiety and stress and every day is a struggle - a struggle you almost always lose. \n\nDon't get me wrong - I can travel, I can sing, I can play the piano, I can compose music for a symphony orchestra, I can create advanced mathematical problems, I can speak several languages, I can do a lot of things, and yes, I do have some lovely friends, but don't you dare telling me that I can have an almost normal life and that I'm just a little different!  \n\nAnd for my part, I am ashamed. But it's not because of my diagnosis. It's because ... it's me._ I have so many layers of masking, I forget who I am.\nThere are only four people who get to see the real me, and I am rarely added to that list._ can we talk about how theres no help for autistic men no programs no help no jobs and people claim they hire us but only hold 15 job positions for challenged people and since we are seen as liabilities for no reason people dont want to hire us how about the fact autistic females get 90 percent more help then us which needs to change all of this needs to change if you have ever targeted harassed or caused conflicts in our lifes your lucky you didnt get a federal charge even denying us progressive living and fair rights to progression is a federal charge how about the fact that we have to hide who we are to get any job or friends and its exhausting im not doing it anymore normies can piss off and eat my facts the love i had for people is dead i had to use improv acting to get better at hiding my true self i will no longer do it i will no longer hold back my voice because you dont want to her truth  can we talk about how autism speaks only uses 0.5 percent of their donations to help adult men and they paid their ceo one million dollars out of our donations and spread false fear mongering information to the public and to families_ lol_ ‚Äúthe big reveal‚Äù hit hard because i realized that whenever i make new friends i care about, i always think ‚Äúsoon enough theyll see how weird i am and they might leave‚Äù‚Ä¶..that was my version of the big reveal. i didnt even know i had autism until now (19). if i ever get a new friend i think ‚Äúif we ever stopped being friends theyd go tell others about how messed up i am‚Äù for no reasonüíî all these random things flash throught my brain constantly, whilst on the other side of the phone my friends have no idea im constantly thinking that sometimes_ Yes. I hate the noise! Even visual!\n\nIt's just we are considered the aberrant values of the sample. Well. If I don't like some stuff, why should I stand it!?_ 'Some people think that our ability to mask is the cure. But that really just makes us ashamed of ourselves\"\n\nThis is huge. And, like with a lot of my ASD traits, I see that this affects people in general, but can be devastating to us_ Ethan deserves a knighting for his efforts to inform the public about autism._ 2:45 Audience loudly clapping and shouting \n,,I don't like loud noises\"\nAudience loudly clapping and shouting at the end anyway_ I got this herbal supplement from Dr Oyalo channel and used it on my son for 4week and within the period of using it there was positive changes which really urge me to continue and I can say my son is free from autism now as his speech and social skill has improved_ I got this herbal supplement from Dr Oyalo channel and used it on my son for 4week and within the period of using it there was positive changes which really urge me to continue and I can say my son is free from autism now as his speech and social skill has improved_ I got this herbal supplement from Dr Oyalo channel and used it on my son for 4week and within the period of using it there was positive changes which really urge me to continue and I can say my son is free from autism now as his speech and social skill has improved_ What?

Not that you would notice with how much I talk now.\n\nAutism isn't a disease, it isn't a problem to be solved and it is not life limiting I have difficulty show empathy and reading social cues. I have been accused of being cold and hurtful towards people but I just don't recognise things are others would.\n\nI proudly announce my Autism to people loudly whilst shaking their hand. It normally puzzles people but I brace them for the verbal they are about to receive.\n\nIf I were to meet Ethan I would firmly shake his hand and give him a strong embrace. His words touched me and I saw so much of myself in his speech.\n\nMy channel has garbage truck/bin lorry videos, I'll show you how autism hasn't held me back.\n\nStay safe, one love ‚ù§Ô∏è_ I'm just amazed this guy has the nuts to get up there in front of a crowd and explain this like he is.._ Good video_ Hates loud noises....

They would then cure even themselves_ Thank you so much for sharing, Ethan._ I found out I was diagnosed with ASD when I was small a few days ago, and I felt extremely happy because I now understand why I am the way I am, but I also didn't know how to carry the news. I notice now that I was feeding the stereotypes my sister and friend had when I told them, and I feel bad for doing so. I had no idea I was autistic, so I had little information about it, and now I need to learn a lot to understand myself better._ Awesome job, Ethan! Public speaking is not easy for most people._ ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•_ I think it was a joke. üòâ_ Hey I'm canadien and autistic_ You sound like a cool old school rocker.

It‚Äôs hard to avoid the peer pressure to want to flee the group if one is the only autistic person in it when one is in a group that believes stereotypes üò¢ and it‚Äôs hard when the group is vital to one‚Äôs career\n\nI think also sometimes when a person with autism shows empathy, after extreme sensitivity to seeing someone suffer, the neurotypical person doesn‚Äôt recognize it or thinks it‚Äôs not the expression that resonates with them. It‚Äôs difficult especially when one wants to help so much but non autistic neurotypicals don‚Äôt sense it (especially when the comfort we offer is overly emotional, literal and mechanistic). No judgement intended_ I‚Äôve been trying to understand autism because I noticed it‚Äôs on the rise and I would like to know how to deal with autistic people.  This was one of the best videos I watched on the subject, it was very informative. I had no idea there is very little information on something that seems to be on the rise and isn‚Äôt going away any time soon. This young gentleman did great and I wish him all the best!_ Autistic people are special and we certainly have to be more sensitive to their needs. We're kind of only starting to focus on mental and cognitive functional aspects and defocus on neutro-typicalness and topics as such as a society._ I have autism, and I have been studying medicine for 10 years. A passionate hyper-focus.\nAutism has been more heavily researched, starting in the 80s. Break throughs were made by Greek physician, Theo Theoharides. \n\nIt starts as a genetic component that causes neuroinflammation/CNS inflammation, and generalized, low-grade inflammation on the rest of the body. \n\nAutistics have a higher saturation of microglia (immune system of the CNS), and very hyper-active Mast cells (neuroimmune cells that degranulate and relase inflammatory mediators). They also often have decreased white matter in the brain. \n\nAs you'll notice, many autistics also have other immunal manifestations, often autoimmune diseases (I have one called, Mast Cell Acivation Syndrome. Common ones are Ezcema, Psoriasis, Kerotoconus, a variety of immune mediated Myalgic diseases, Lupus, ect..\n\nMany are comorbid with Ehler's Danlos Syndrome, and other connective/hypermobile tissue disorders, Marfanism, and high saturation of Histamin in the gut, of which causes GI distress and dysfunction.\n\nI understand that we now exist in a culture that is obsessed with inclusivity and being politically correct, but as a result, science has really taken the hit. \n\nAutism is a disease. It can create a unique and beautiful mind, but it is not a state of wellness, nor should we ignorantly dismiss the overwhelming evidence-based fact, that it is not just a neurotype, but an immunal dysfunction, with majorly uncomfortable symptoms that impact and even torment some individuals, daily._ Fantastic presentation. Your are great._ Can we also talk about how it's still very socially acceptable to make fun of the \"awkward\", \"anti-social\", \"quiet\", \"keeps to themselves\" people, and how it can go from there right to not-so-subtle suggestions of them being things that I don't dare even mention because it would probably get this post flagged? In a world where you will get instantly called out for fat-shaming someone, it's still quite ok to disdainfully point out how that \"loser monotone computer guy\" has no friends and you wouldn't be surprised to hear that he has offed himself over the holidays...._ I'm autistic and would jump off a cliff for a cure_ Society isn't against you, it's indifferent, that's what equality looks like._ Good speech_ Good advice_ Based :D_ as an aspie myself Autism is both a blessing and a curse.

She was close to getting me diagnosed with \"something\". My dad called her \"retarded\" and forced her to \"stop with the nonsense\". He simply said I'm lazy and stupid and an adult and that I just need a taste of the real world. He kicked me out of the house. I slept on the street for a week. Got an apartment for super cheap, rats, roaches, and all. Dropped out of college to pay the bills and have been tripping and falling through life ever since. \n\nLike I said, you're lucky._ @fwdcnorac8574¬† that's a great way of looking at it.

Not understanding social cues can cost you._ I agree, as a mom of two autistic children and 2 non autistic children it's so important for the public to be educated and laws needs to be changed regarding autistic rights in this country and services available to every autistic citizen._ Thank you for speaking for the kids who can't speak for themselves üòáüôèüèº_ Oh, and I also see nice hair_ I appreciate seeing the young man you grew up to be. \nMy 5 year old is diagnosed autistic. \n\nHe is exceptional at math and is already doing algebra and multiplication in his head.\nHe can remember the countries within a continent and reads well‚Ä¶ we are still working on his ability to communicate more fluently with his peers. \n\nAll I want in the world for him is to be able to steer through the world but to also cherish the gift he was given, a lot like this young man.

I was told I wouldn‚Äôt get far in life, I was lazy , too sensitive and self centred but here I am graduated with a 2:1 in psychology, awaiting to start my post grad and with the aim to become a clinical psychologist. Yes we think differently but we can also tech the world to understand us if they are willing to listen.\n\nI often get told I don‚Äôt look autistic because I don‚Äôt fit the stereotype._ Just stop and think of what \"normal\" people do. They obsess over hygiene because it's socially acceptable and create resistant bacteria that is more infectious. They take pride in work that destroys their body and mental patterns over time because it's socially acceptable to have money.  They were taught an imperfect language like english only to use it to tell other people that they speak it with the wrong intervals of time and that that somehow reflects their ability to think. The reality is that english is english at any given rate. People are just taught to do everything quickly to create a competitive atmosphere that benefits only the tax collectors. I see the world as a large group of slaves who were shamed into fitting the human model and everytime something exists outside of it people have to correct it and promote their idea of normal. Imagine a world made for autistic people. Everything would be a lot easier to do because living life would not be \"skill-based\" around a defined normal intelligence level._ I have autistic._ I think that parents are guilty for autism in children.lack of love and perfectionism_ I'd kill to get rid of my autism_ Because of one of the requirements to curing autism, in this revolution telekinesis is unbelievably becoming common knowledge.

It will be late (I‚Äôm 32) but this video opened up even more knowledge about myself. Many of my family think I am likely autistic but through environmental upbringing I‚Äôve just overcame some of its challenges. Here I am just figuring out that those environmental challenges I‚Äôve overcome is me masking, and to great effect. I am most certainly a master of masking, the average person who approaches me and talks to me would likely never know (and while undiagnosed as of yet, I doubt I‚Äôm high on the spectrum) but my family of course notices the small things that make it stand out. \n\nAll of these videos is opening a painful window into how I‚Äôve morphed my mind to work with the ‚Äònormal‚Äô world, and I do it well, but it‚Äôs to the detriment of my own mental well-being. It feels so horrible to display yourself differently from who you actually are._ dear god i hope this is a troll_ Absolutely not_ Yeah no_ Autism cannot be cured._ Its a pain. Can be very hard to live with. Took my son 35 years to be fairly sure, and not much chance of a diagnosis in 5-10 years.

Still learning though._ Cheese_ Bottom line autistic ppl don‚Äôt have normal feelings witch will make you socially awkward can‚Äôt keep up with the normal brain_ Thank you for sharing. This is a good reminder that society is structured too rigidly and we need to make room for different forms of expression, feeling, and thinking. Normal is so overrated_ I know the super genius part can be offensive, but I gotta say it, I have five well established friends who are autistic, and every single one of them blows me away with how freakin intelligent they are. I know they aren‚Äôt ‚Äúgeniuses‚Äù in the stereotypical way, I even catch them in debates and pick at their points‚Ä¶ what it is that really makes me believe it is a gift‚Ä¶ their ability to retain information at the rate they do, and formulate some of the BEST advice I have ever gotten in life. Like, we are talking 100% accuracy in my life improving by applying their advice. It just blows my mind. Maybe it‚Äôs not ‚Äúsuper genius‚Äù, but very good members to have in our society? High value people? YES._ \"Extraordinary attorney woo\" the k drama draws me into the video_ Being ashamed is a real thing, i genuinely hate myself most of the time._ I was misdiagnosed for a long time with bipolar. It was simply because i am incredibly good at masking and copying, no one saw the sheer stress this caused. I was considered very social but it was simply my ability to bounce off other people and steer a conversation through borderline intellectual manipulation. Im not proud of that._ I once knew a child with autism. When he was very young he was absolutely horrible with his screaming and destructive behaviors. I actually felt bad about disliking him so much. He became more likeable as he got older. I'm sure I encounter adults with autism too, now that I've learned to recognize some symptoms or characteristics. It's just another aspect of human life we have to learn to respond correctly to._ <3_ I love how I‚Äôm the beginning he üíØ describes himself and then says well I know this stereotype isn‚Äôt true because I am autistic.

Really well, I have perfect pitch. BUT I'm so socially inhibited that I can't even begin to think of allowing anyone else to hear me sing even though my entirely logical mind is well aware I'm pretty darn good. I struggle to mix with others enough to buy groceries so there's no chance I'd get up on a stage and show others what I can do. This guy has balls._ The loud music for me is an expected rhythm. I am more uneasy when I hear the world around me. I can't avoid putting definitions to everything I hear. But everything is relative, even the ground to the car traveling over it. So paying attention to things is very difficult. Autism stinks for me because I want to say so much, but I never have the words that allow me to feel that I am 1. heard 2. understood 3. not overwhelming with too much information all at once. I don't deal with it well that other \"normal\" people, seem to get further in life because they are able to filter out and focus. Too simple to know much else, too dumb to do much else. I hate normal people so much I don't want to be either and just accept that I had a bit flip on Aug 15 1977 when I was born. The day of the Wow signal._ Bravo_ The words I would use to describe this young man: Brave, Vulnerable, Sensitive, Honest, Caring and an Exemplary ability to LOVE.  I could write a paragraph on each word with ease. Fine young man with a Video that should be archived to show todays conditions for ASD people.  I hope in one hundred years from today with all this intervention going on at a young age that a talk by Ethan would be changed due to the hopeful changes of this and continued research on the subject.  Imagine the joy of NOT having to explain your every word, noise, facial expression and so on‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. as if you were speaking a foreign language.

If he seems like the type who isn't social, or can be overwhelmed by conversation, just ask him how he is doing every day and leave it at that. If you make it a routine to tell him hello or ask how he is doing every day, you'll become a part of his routine._ @7evYT¬† you know this reminded me of something. Like I'm usually a loner (but I do talk to people and have friends and all). So this one time I was sitting alone and he literally came up to me and said that I could sit next to him. At that moment I kinda got flustered and told him no. But then I started overthinking and thought that did i seem that l lonely to him. It was such a bittersweet situation. Because I don't know how to talk to him.üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠_ @akanksha_soren¬† I know the feels. I've been out of school for awhile now, and I can remember more than one situation where I liked a girl and didn't know how to approach her, so I just never did. Just remember that if you really want something, you gotta just go for it. Even if it ends in some embarrassing way, I promise that is better than having regret for not going for it in the future!_ As a normal person, there are times when I hate people in general, as well. It's a passing feeling though. Do you feel this hate for other people all the time? Or is it also just a passing feeling? I only ask because hate is a very corrosive feeling. It ends up hurting you if you hold onto it for too long. Just be yourself and do the things you love to the best of your ability. You will find your place. And always remember, even normal people struggle every day to find out who they are as a person and how they fit into the giant puzzle that is reality. You aren't alone._ @7evYT¬† Never get too caught in a word, it's meaning may be different to someone else. Hate in this term describes the simple vs impossibly complex. I hate too simple, but get tired and wear thin at being overly complex about everything. I would hate to be normal, in that sense. I hate the fact that in most cases it is a choice for a person to use their brain heavily, and most choose to not use it. So many would rather let someone else deal with those details. Well, literally all of those details I am perpetually driven to question, forever in the \"just about to answer\" mode. It can be productive, but even I have to learn how to leave it alone and let it do what it wants. Usually it's music on and from one task to the next. Full on combined ADHD at full steam 24/7, it sucks but I'm not sure I really wish to be any other way. I just wish I could communicate and have friends, but most of the people like me are hiding just the same. As for finding a place, I have been able to see that place since I was 12 years old. 33 years later, I am almost there and I will say that I am stunned that I have been able to get to where I have today. Stay tuned, there will be a certain revolution in my name!_ The world isn't even set up in a way that introverted people can feel comfortable. I couldn't imagine having autism._ Autism isn‚Äôt a disease. Like he said, it‚Äôs another way of thinking. It‚Äôs not a bad thing. I have Aspergers and I can still function as a human being but I want to be treated with respect as an autistic person. That‚Äôs all us autistic people want. We‚Äôre not annoying or shy. We‚Äôre freaking autistic. I show a ton of empathy but no one ever shows empathy for me and people who lack empathy are psychotic._ Thank you for such a great talk!

I was nearly blnded by constant bright lights in my face.\n\nDue to photophobia (i.e. light sensitivity,) from autism, my eyes hurt from being constantly subjected to bright lights while trapped in an improper setting. Continuum of Care, an agency clsiming to \"\"rebuild lives\", employs negligent stafg without any certifcations. They're in it for an easy paycheck. I pleaded with them to stop allowing a bully to destroy my belongings. They hid in the office. They tried and failed to commit me for being harassed by a bully they forced me to reside with. I'm still a hostsge since I don't choose where to reside I finally moved out of that place, still trapped in Continuum of Care. My own $ would be witheld if I discharged myself.\nPpl with autism are under attack and expected to not defend ourselves.\nThe Department of Public Health\nwould probably retaliate if I reported said violations.

But everyone is different I guess._ Humankind would never reach the stars, if there were no people on the Autism Spectrum. Neurotypical is just fine for farmers, craftsmen, clerks, and factory workers, but it took some SPECIAL thinking to conceptualize and develop the modern miracles that people already take for granted. I often think of \"Star Trek, The Next Generation\" as an ideal that we, as a species could hope to achieve. There is NO WAY that vast level of technology was conceived and developed solely by Neurotypicals. Others in the (literally) special (or specialized?) range also includes those with ADHD (and their ability to hyperfocus), and the dyslexic (with their innate ability to simultaneously perceive and comprehend, holographically--in all physical dimensions, including time--as opposed to neurotypical, linear thinkers).\nI believe that human evolution is ALWAYS happening. As Technology advances, Neuro-ATYPICAL traits (enhancements?) are being SELECTED FOR, BECAUSE of their differences from Neurotypical linear thinkers. SOME are twice, or thrice Blessed (AKA, presenting multiple atypical traits). ONE DAY, they will become the PREFFERED choice of mate, because it INCREASES the chance of any offspring to be Truly SPECIAL, AND Successful in the hyper technological future._ My Asperger‚Äôs roommate was a slobby mess who within the first week tried to drop subtext about that he was sexually open ‚Äòto whatever‚Äô while quickly and aggressively detracting while later throughout talking about buttsex and gay rockstars and atheist painting w blood and ‚Äò..Africas actually pretty much more advanced than you‚Äôd think of it‚Äô and making apologetic statements about ‚Äòpedophiles and ü§§ serial killers‚Äô and bursting out of his room talking about Satanism while trying to belittle my presence bc he could sense my weakness bc I was sick and the ‚Äòunicorns fucking‚Äô and projected upon leaving that I was the slob and that the room was already a mess when he got there_ I have autism to, it isn't particularly bad but I do have it and I agree with this guy 100%. I get overwhelmed with loud noises so much I can have small mental breakdowns unless iam in controller of it, I don't like oatmeal or strawberrys cause of the texture, I don't like to much light. But iam told iam very smart tho I don't see it. And like him I can hide it so we'll no one's knows I'm autistic while they call other people autistic cause there dumb. I also hate change, idk if that is autistic made one of you guys could answer that for me. I love trains and turcks and I have troble showing my emotions. But I wouldnt change it at all, I may be different thena others but I like that._ And in real life when you are an introverted , some relidicous people say that you have AUTISM , And they don't understand what's the AUTISM in first place , Mostly introverted people accepting the truth they are introvert, because they want it most of the time and this is their desire! \nBut they don't understand AUTISM people how they are suffering in their own life to Express their own needs .\nIt's bad sometimes that there are a people thinking this way and don't understand how big is this for AUTISMS!_ Thank you Ethan Lisi_ I have a daily struggle to keep calm with how loudly I talk and the pitch and tone. It is also an acute daily struggle for me to pace my restless brain to work at the right pace, the healthy pace, for the whole hour and the whole day. My restlessness from the Asperger's and the antipsychotic medication I take makes my brain sometimes angrily restless with OCD the severity of which makes me have inner hostility and inner aggression._ This chap will probably be Much more comfortable in 500 years or so when Androids and Humanised Robots are Prevalent all over the place!_ I despise the people on TikTok that fake having Autism or convince themselves they do when in reality they don‚Äôt, cause it sheds a really negative light on people who actually are affected and genuinely struggle to live with it._ here after watching the first 6 episodes of the kdrama EXTRAORDINARY ATTORNEY WOO! and I‚Äôm really amazed and fascinated by autistic people! they really are an inspiration ü§çü§çü§ç_ treat with fish, salt and green foods for autism, \nfish for soul, salt for the lows, and green foods for sociability_ You are amazing_ Thank you so much by telling people the truth about what autistic people think or how their brains work differently.

That makes me so happy to read your story. That movie I AM LEGEND was scripted about you!_ I'm proud of you! I'm autistic and working on my biochem degree. Patterns help me with this all the time, but explaining what I see when answering questions is very difficult. People will try to be mean to put you in a place they expect people to be and it makes me sad and afraid of certain types, but I've found it easier to recognize the good ones, and how to be a good one to others. The world needs people who see it differently and we're a big part of that._ I also saw his recommendation and approach Dr Oyalo for the herbs on YouTube.

My child social skill is good now and response to name has improved too_ You are perfect my boy ‚ù§Ô∏è_ So what is the spectrum that autistic can do_ I'm 29 years old and autistic. I have high functioning autism. I was diagnosed with autism when I was only 2 years old. I've now been through 27 years of living with autism and I don't feel ashamed._ The thing about autism that I feel gets forgotten a lot, is that literally everyone is different. Some people can‚Äôt even function because of it, others are barely effected by it. Autism is so broad, and has so many different effects, that I rarely ever state stuff about it as fact. For example, if I were to list a symptom of autism, I would say that ‚Äúmost‚Äù or ‚Äúsome‚Äù people with autism have this symptom, because not everyone can have that symptom._ My Son is an autism too. what he said in video was true._ My kid has autism. Until now I'm trying to give my full understanding by living in his world. At first I questioned the Creator but now I want to receive him as a special give from above._ If you're happy then why change._ Just because your autistic does not mean you are not human. Or incapable of living a successful and productive life you just have different veiwpoint on the r world around you and need a little extra help and support then others in order to achieve you goals and dreams. We should just except people for who they are and instead of being afraid give effort to understand. Instead of shunning people who appear different. Because everyone is unique in there own special way. We would live in a much happier place if we just accepted people for who they are instead of judging them because they appear different._ My latest obsession is watching videos about autism._ Unfortunately, OED defines a \"disorder\" as an \"illness.\"\n\nCan we go with difference?_ We all mask sweetheart ._ While I can appreciate that in modern times it simply just a matter of thinking differently. But what must be appreciated is the fact that  much of society is based on remnants of a time when life was literally a struggle. Go back 100 years, and 1 in 4 of your children would not make it. Your ability to survive through a winter depended on every member of your family and community working together.\n\nI'd argue that while modern society is not built towards autistic individuals, there has never been a better time to be alive with such a condition._ As a mom it just really hurts when people look at my child like he‚Äôs weird, or when no childcare wants to accept him.  The autism doesn‚Äôt hurt me.  It‚Äôs the rejection from so called ‚Äúnormal‚Äù people.  That is what I‚Äôm learning to cope with._ Masking takes a LOT of mental energy._ Everyone uses autism. The ones that grown up abuse think they have autism, but its just a behavioral disorder._ My Mother is Autistic like the speakers Mother, but I am non autistic.  It was difficult for me to deal with it because when you need some real guidance and emotional support autistic people are not there for you.  They're only good if they're not closely related to you and you don't have to depend on them.  In my opinion, autistic people are, with outside factors such as drugs and/or alcohol, are Terrible parents.  I can't even imagine an autistic parent or parents that also have drug and/or alcohol problems!_ I am autistic. Be it a disease, defect or condition it's something that should be cured. The exact reason autism is on the rise is unclear, but many factors are being studied. Mainly the effect that modern technology, diet, agriculture and many other factors have on the development of humans._ That's why it is called spectrum. How many people with autism when they grow old cant even live independently. They don't even know that they have autism._ THANK YOU Ethan Lisi for speaking for those who cannot! Thank you for your poise and communication skills that I am sure were not a simple task for you to perform for us \"normals\" to understand. Thank you on behalf of my son. My son is also autistic. He is absolutely wonderful in every way. I have always hated that he walks the world with a target on his back and unable to clearly communicate with others. I know that he is capable but I also know that it is very difficult. I have to try and try and try to communicate with him at times. I know that the struggle is equal on his end of things also. More people in this world need to stop giving up on people who are autistic and discarding them as broken in some way. People fear what they do not understand. Thank you for helping many to understand. Thank you for choosing to put yourself out to the world._ I am on the spectrum myself, and I can tell with all my heart that autism is nothing to be ashamed of. It may come with it's boundaries, but it shouldn't be judged poorly. But it is hard to judge it successfully._ 1) Detail oriented. \n2) Enhanced consistency in logical thinking.\n3) Hyper focus.\n4) Extremely talented.\n5) Great memory.\n6) More self-control._ @danielmoore4024¬† Thank you, Daniel._ @danielmoore4024¬† yeah no thats bullshit.

God bless you doctor_ I applaud his courage to speak of his condition. \"Pretending\" to be \"normal\" (whatever THAT is) can, in itself, be overwhelming. What disheartens me, is that SOME of the population UNDERSTAND that when they OVERWHELM a person on the spectrum, that they will go into shut down or (when cornered) emotionally LASH OUT. So these \"people\" INTENTIONALLY overwhelm the Aspie to abate them as a person or consistently get an adverse reaction (basically on cue). SHAME ON THEM!_ Yes of course autism & other disorders are part of the natural human spectrum. However, that doesn't mean that there aren't people with more severe/extreme and debilitating forms of autism, who require 24/7 help and support and can't function at all in human society. I understand that autistic people don't want it to be seen as a \"disease,\" but I really disagree with the notion that scientists should stop seeking a preventative cure for autism, because many people and their families are struggling and suffering with much more severe forms than the one presented here._ ‚ÄúI have autism.‚Äù shocked face lol_ My son improved excellently from his autism spectrum disorder with assistance of herbal medicine from Dr imenherbal channel on YouTube_ I've been diagnosed with autism OCD and ADHD_ I'm not a tinfoil hat wearing conspiracy theorists, but I truly believe that whatever is causing such high rates of autism is either environmental or in our food._ How can drugs reprogram a brain üß†?  The world is not a fan of Autistic people, or other disabled people.  So spinners make the day better, emotions are  hard to communicate,  and  there is nothing wrong with a woo-hoo.  Being quiet and low lights helps the Autistic person deal with everyday life.  Today we know more about helping people with Autism. To be gental with the children, or adults is a must. I have great sympathy for the children with Autism, because l am dyslexic.  Maybe if you can't understand how deeply a brain function disorder affects your life, try to watch an Autistic child trying to play with a normal child. You will see that one child will be able to connect,  and the Autistic child will have a hard playing with the other. You can see the child interested in objects, than other people. Just think about what the child maybe missing in social interactions.  The best you can do is take the child by the hand, to quietly explain what is going on and be extremely patient. They need your attention and love. I remember that l was treated that way by most of my teachers. As a disasabled person it is nessary to realize the world looks so much different to us.  What takes you five minutes to finish,  could take them much longer. But they will learn._ i feel like bursting really loud .  I know what the consequences are . I just suffer in silence and wait to die._ He has great eye contact, faker_ This the new bullshit you brainwashing our kids with?_ Here is something I want you to know about the Autism spectrum. It is a very wide vista of thinking and reacting values. The speaker in this presentation is not characteristic of the entire spectrum.  He is a part of it, absolutely. In fact, the public perception of the spectrum does indeed focus more on people who might be upset by a range of food smells or tactile sensations or loud noises. Those are all valid characterizations for many people on the spectrum. However, there are thousands of people who are definitely on the spectrum for whom those aspects are not in play. We are very smart, without all of us having an appreciation of Maxwell's Equations.... or being accomplished violinists. Sure, if it helps, you can place all of us into a box, but it needs to be a VERY large box. I hope that helps._ My child scream with all lungs, do tantrum in public and is aggressive to me... probably not a disease but for sure not a superpower. If one day someone develop a medicine to make him \"normal\", we will go  for it.  One day we will die and he will not be able to take care of himself... God have mercy on us and cure my boy, in the name of Jesus._ I want to talk to everyone. But instead find myself alone with no one. Happy/ not happy_ Damn I would have never guessed he had autism. When he revealed that I was mindblowned!!!!!_ Ask we get older, we figure ourselves and others out. We realize that we don't hate loud noises, necessarily, we hate when the music sucks and the conversations are boring. We should find our best music and crank it up and sing along loudly, whether driving in our cars with windows down, or home alone so we can dance like crazy and feel the peace and joy of energy and love. As we got older, we seek out the weird, because it's way cooler than the \"norm.\" Life is too complex and interesting and we know so little. God makes us different and we use our authentic brains and perspectives to make our world a better and more meaningful place. It's an adventure! Enjoy life! Don't let your heart get broken by it!_ hahaha someone farted at 1:09_ I was diagnosed with autism as an adult. This video was helpful to me.

God bless you in everything you do in lifeüí™ü•∞_ I've sort of assumed that an autistic person usually has unusual insights or perceptions the rest of us lack, but might simply have difficulty expressing them at times._ My Son is on the spectrum, he is the most amazing person I know. I could never live without him. My son definitely has empathy, it is hard to express_ I have no problem with people trying to find a cure for autism. Autism is a mental disorder and mental disorders are diseases.\nIf something is mostly a negative over a positive, is it wrong to try to find a way to prevent it from happening?_ I could listen to this dude talk for hours_ I swear the name Ethan gives you Austism, talking from experience._ Amin brother...._ I have a 4 year old who displays a lot of the traits discussed here.

Better then I would in front of a group  I'm sure he was nervous .  Thanks for the insight._ It's a struggle socially_ <3_ It's very unhealthy to think the world isn't \"built for us\" because it changes positive perspectives towards a lot of things. One being that you subject yourself to the belief that you don't belong another being that you convince yourself of a vast separation within society. The world in a sense is built for everyone but if we were to look at it from his modern societies perspective then the world isn't built for anyone in that case. One of the biggest things noticeable to people who have autism against those who don't and vice versa is how they adapt to the world around them, it's only an illusion if you think those who aren't like you are fitting in perfectly because you aren't from your own perspective, take people who aren't autistic for example.. the majority of them (especially younger generations) are trying to fit in, they are actively trying to find a place that suits them within their own societies.\n\nYour behaviour patterns will only get worse as it has with others when you continue to separate yourself from the rest of the world. Granted, it might feel that way and that's normal but to allow your feelings outweigh your thoughts will only promote an imbalance between emotional and rational thinking. The truth of the matter is, everyone is different regardless.. society isn't as black and white as it might seem. Embrace your difference and accept that there will always be those who wont._ Is he considered ASD-1 or ASD-2. I find it odd he didn't specify._ why did no one laugh when he said \"a white Male speaking in monotone\"? lmao sjendien_ Oh i have atusim i like mlp and 13 years old_ Oh man it hurts to hear how some perceptions of autism are. God didn't make a mistake when He made you._ So what does Toronto Union Station means?

He‚Äôs hecking smart too, and doing physics with him is great since he‚Äôs actually bearable to speak to_ My masking is sometimes so good that when I told a friend I had autism, they said ‚Äúhey, it‚Äôs not funny to pretend to have a mental illness‚Äù. This caused me to laugh uncontrollably, which only worsened the situation._ You sound like a phenomenal mother. I wish great things for you and your son!_ It's already been proven that Autism is not a disease, therefore it cannot be cured. Inform yourself propperly about it._ @filipeflower¬† In what way has that been proven? I gave an argument for why it is a disease while all you did is say that it isn‚Äôt._ @CaffeinatedNihilism I know. Even autistic activists debunked that statement already (such as Sara Rocha, for example)._ It is wrong, because you can't cure what isn't really a disease. Read the DSM V._ Bullshit._ Be proud of your kid. I've worked with autistic kids at school and they were all unique. They never caused trouble, they perceived the world a bit differently but to me it was really special. Of course they need praise and a steady environment. It is the other kids and parents actually that look down on them which is very sad... I hope this changes soon. I'm going to have a talk this year with my students about this issue in class, I hope they get more aware. People with differences of any kind should not have to struggle to get accepted in this cruel world._ Can you please summarize your point?_ @filipeflower¬† The first sentence was the point. The rest was an insight to any reader that was curious as to why the point makes sense.\n\nPoint being. You shouldn't going around thinking you don't belong in this world OR go around teaching people that autistic people don't belong in this world because it creates an unnecessary and additional handicap._ @beardedserious6837¬† That's your opinion. But my point is autistic people have a place in this world as well._ @filipeflower¬† I don't think you understood what I said even after I explained it to you.\n\nMy point is that everyone has a place in this world, the guy in the video said that Autistic people don't belong in this world. I was the one saying they do and explained why, he wasn't and didn't._ @beardedserious6837¬† Oh...ok, sorry about that ._ The problem with your arguments is, you cant separate  Neurological disorders and Mental illnesses  from the Capitalist Society they get up in, because it affects every facet of how their symptoms and Habits and actions and understandings are Patrolled and set by Socirty as a whole_ Does he have to?_ Absolutely brilliant and informative talküëèüèøüëèüèøüëèüèøüíØüëåüèø_ This guy is one of the smarter autistic people in the world tbh, and I would know because I know some pretty weird autistic people_ I am gay and I am Autistic.

Says shocking things to gain attention and respect. He‚Äôs a great teammate. So unselfish. He passes too much in hockey because he wants people to like him though he should shoot. The boys know this so every time he gets the puck they call his name. It‚Äôs infuriating. The good news is he‚Äôs learning to be independent and decide for himself what‚Äôs best at the time. You must watch the bullies that take advantage of these awesome people. I don‚Äôt use that term lightly. \nGod bless them all!_ No wonder why I struggle working in sales so much.

I have autism and it is literally just like feeling like anyone else.  Everyone processes things differently even 'normal' people.  There is no 'cure' to autism and to think or want a cure is inhumane.  It isn't a disability, it is a different lifestyle.  I make more and work less than any of my non autistic friends while being happy and healthy._ I‚Äôm on the spectrum, it‚Äôs hard to function socially.  It‚Äôs a battle every day._ i can elaborate pretty well but i need others to elaborate a lot more . i wonder if it works both ways i sense i am autistic as well. i may have been missed in the 80‚Äôs . i remember my parents thought something was wrong and took me to get an mri and basically what for ? blinks eyes a lot and makes some weird noise . i grew out of that  i think or it just morphed. i believe i maskd so much . i never been diagnosed . till this day i am extremely sensitive to light and loud music i like sometimes but loud noise from people talking or outside noise makes me where i can‚Äôt think straight sometimes . but i think people try and hide it because then someone can say something‚Äôs wrong with em . i o remember growing up how i dealt with people i would draw on my side over and over with my finger . draw the little R or 8 . maybe it was mild idk but now it popped up in my family someone recently diagnosed with autism ._ 1:09 someone farted lol üòÇ_ What a superb Guy, his parents should be very proud to have a son who is not phased by talking openly in front of a crowd of people._ where did this guy get the steryotypes of autism_ Love your honesty and courage to talk about it openly. Thank you._ I support this idea of autism as difference not a disease but its always high functioning people who express there is nothing wrong with autism. At the same time there are people with severe forms of autism for whom it is an hourly struggle to prevent from severe self-injury and who have never and may never have an opportunity to communicate to their loved ones. We cannot know whether they prefer it that way or whether they feel trapped. I don't think it's wrong to want to find medical  treatments or even \"cures\" for some of the symptoms of severe autism, so such a person can have options the way high functioning people with autism do. At minimum, the ability to communicate, (whether verbally, typing, with hand signs or a communication board) is such an essential piece of human dignity, if there IS a way medically to make such a thing possible for those who can't, I think it is our duty to find it._ My son is Autistic.

So i mask, i pretend to very quiet while all the time a thousand thoughts are russhing around in my head and im tempted to isolate one of those thoughts and speak it......eg, a social conversataion may be about a work issue and workmates may discuss a former employee for example, and im having hundreds of thoughts about that person. as soon as i think ive isolated a relavent thought, i blurt it out, only to learn that the conversation has moved on to cars, or something someone has bought recently etc. this makes me appear slow and unintelligent when in fact i am of extremely high intelligence. perception of autistic people is in my experience so wrong. others ask me why i can talk to them but not other people and i cant explain this...they say to me, just talk to them as if you are talking to me. But i can only use analogies to explain. so i tell them they can hold a pen in their left hand and easily draw a line on paper, but if they tried to write left handed(or opposite hand to normal) their writing will mostly be unintelligable unless they really sit down and focus very hard on writing with their left hand and even still it will be an untidy set of words or sentences and taken so much longer to write than if they were to use their good hand. asking an autistic person to pretend theyre normal is like me asking you to write out what ive typed in this comment but with your left hand.....yes they will get it done but so slowly and not neat at all. they know how to write, they know the alphabet and all the words in the dictionary and topped the class in reading and writing, but they struggle just simply coz they have changed hands. telling an autistic person to act normal can be done with some of us, but its still as difficult as me telling you to copy this long comment out on paper using your opposite hand. try it and see how frustrated you get after just a few words, while your partner tells you to keep up with them as theyre writing out this same comment with their good hand. then add a cd playing in the background with nothing but a man or woman calling out random letters and numbers and words. this is my life outside of my house. And i too am not ashamed of my autism spectrum disorder. Great speach Ethan. ps sorry i wrote such a long comment, but i dont expect anyone to read this far down so i dont really feel so bad about this. Ps, i actually feel really bad, i was masking. :)_ There is no cure for Autism spectrum disorder. It is not a disease. I have Autism Spectrum Disorder._ Fun fact: Autism is only considered a disability because of the terrible society we‚Äôre forced to live in\n\nAs someone with social anxiety disorder, another very misunderstood mental disorder, I fully believe that autism is not a disability or a disease.

Anybody here have autism or know of someone and can they work like non autistic people?_ que progressives saying\n\"NO you ARE autistic, you dont HAVE Autism\"_ i see why stand up comedy could be hard for an autist... hard to read the room_ Because I have never heard any of this_ What problems?_ @filipeflower¬† Autism is considered a disorder so if you have those traits, you should be considered flawed. That is, society as a whole thinks you are a problematic because you don't fit in the herd._ Your point?_ I have very little autism, but the bit I do have definitely makes my life interesting, for better or worse. I don‚Äôt really like loud noises like vehicles or tools being used and I have trouble understanding sarcasm sometimes, but I was able to persevere and now these things aren‚Äôt as bothersome. Plus, my autism allows me to focus well on things I‚Äôm interested, making it easier to get done. To those who think it‚Äôs a disease, it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs a different way of seeing the world. If anything, it has made me better at some things than if I didn‚Äôt have it. All power to my bros in this boat with me!!_ My 20 year old son is autistic , nonverbal and self injurious.

When the water poisons are gone the autistic children will not be autistic at same levels. Many can completely recover. Please check the water with lab for tiny worms and spinning radio wave activating particles, military weapons of war added to our water ways all over America to then disperse the weapon into airways all over America. The worms are weapons and are receivers of electrical current and are intentionally being added to our tap water as a a weapon to connect our brains as receivers to a satani military computer terminal to alter brains medically using the worms that can harden into tiny electrical devices for military control over minds and people's ability to function. Please SUE the govt with many others until autism is ended for good and the children can recover when they are not breathing in the weapons that are dispersed into airways from toilet water and sink drains into homes as a designer military weapon of satanists connected to NAVAL RESEARCH at Halifax, VA airport buildings with a faux medical research facility under a name that may be close to Avarie labs or something sounding a little different but is at the halifax, VA airport roads and has terrorists and satanists who are using computer terminals to operate the little wormy filaments in the brains of all children now that form a goo and is electronic assault weapons! END autism and sue the govt and military for poisoning our water ways all over America with electronic vibrating and spinning worms. Feel your water bottles, it vibrates and is not the same in other countries!! SUE THE GOVT END AUTISM_ I don't see autism here_ Never hide ....your awesome...._ I remember when I went to a convention for autistic people. We were so upset when the manager brought his best friend and said friend's family to check the place out. When we were heard they were not autistic, we pulled the manager aside for a meeting and told him, directly, that we don't want non-Autistic people here at all. He said \"What are you talking about? The husband and dad is my friend from college. He just happened to be nearby during a road trip and I wanted to see him before he got going. Why can't he and his family be here for only half an hour?\" A member answered him, \"they are not Autistic. They look DOWN on us...and deem us lesser people to research and feel sorry for. We will not tolerate their condescension.\" Then I patted the manager's arm and said, \"yeah, so...get 'em out of here. Get 'em out of here now. We don't like their snobbish, judgmental type.\" And I still feel this way. If non-autistic people are going to internally belittle our social skills and think we're inferior, weird, and pitifully disabled, then we don't need 'em in our groups--or presence.

I have a 12 yr old daughter who has autism and she has difficulty with exspressing herself , but by god she cares for everyone and everything , she is all heart and consistently thinks of everyone around her and of how they feel and is it possible for her to make your day better. so she struggles with the way she comes across but if her autism is part of the way she is , well i'l de dammed if she's not even more beautiful for it._ When he says about 1% of the population is diagnosed with autism - he could have mentioned that a lot of people with autism are just that - not diagnosed. I know a lot of people that are not diagnosed with autism but that show a lot (and I mean a LOT) of \"typically\" autistic behaviour, myself included. And still all these people somehow \"work\" in society. I don't see why people with autism (diagnosed or not) should be excluded or considered \"diseased\".

It's like half emma watson and half this guy tristian. when did covid begin?_ Autism is a negative thing and would be better without it_ \"Loud noises overwhelm me.\" The audience is loud a.f._ Normal is a word that was invented to make the masses feel better about the things they do which are in fact weird and different. Most if not all people have an aversion to what we perceive as weird or different. I think it's because of a survival type of gene that. Just like animals leave behind their young if they are not what the gene has told it is the right one who should be fed and let the other die. We are animals too, smart, but animals nonetheless. I like to think that the reason we are so much more advanced and smarter than all the other animals is because of people who are different from all the rest in a significant way. To these people who are different from the majority, we probably look like the equivalent of autistic or any of the other labels we give them, except for them the only label they given us is \"normal\" they don't treat us any different. So who is the normal ones in the end? These people we see as different could be the ones who see the world we so badly want to see but can't because we are just normal._ Completely AWESOME üëèüèæ Great job also üëçüèæüëçüèæüëçüèæüëçüèæ My grandson is autistic and great gift üéÅüòä_ I feel an intense urge to cry when watching cheesy evening dramas such as Eastenders and have to work hard to suppress it, and not just because I'm watching Eastenders, whereas when I'm experiencing a sad moment in real life such as someone telling me that their mother just died, It's like the wheel is turning but the mouse is dead. I don't have the urge to cry, and I can't find the words to express empathy, so I either say nothing, stare and shrug, or attempt to say something helpful and make a mess of it.\n\nIt's always fun when that happens._ I hope my own son can one day be as articulate and brave as this young man_ this guy does not mask well lmao ü§£ worst spy ever_ Thanks brother._ It's like not having legs and saying it's not defect. In my opinion there's a difference between accepting yourself and pretending you're not diseased. And I have asperger which like smaller autism so it's not the hate comment or anything like that. But if I could be neurotypical I would for sure want it because autism/ asperger make life harder and IT IS A DISEASE. So accept yourself love yourself but dont pretend that it's normal because its disadvantage and we have to live around it._ I have ASD.

And just because someone disagress with you, doesn't give you the right to offend that person._ Yeah that makes zero sense haha_ I was diagnosed with autism yet I seem to not have many of these problems in my everyday life, and it's because we aren't all the same, even if we do have autism. If I tell someone that I do have autism they are like \"WHAT!\", because I don't show it and I find it very easy in most circumstances to act \"normal\" and they don't believe that I have it. I think this is because my traits have withered away but I still think the same way that I have since I was a little child. The truth is, I don't know if I act as a person without autism would, or if I am hiding my traits because my whole life I have been in a group that is not understood very well. \n\nTo anyone that is struggling out there, I say this: Don't be afraid to take leaps, because you never know what it's like otherwise.\n\nP.S. Don't worry about me because none of my problems in life arise from who I am, and for that I am happy. :)_ For high functioning autistic people to say that they don't want a cure is really not fair to the people that are non verbal and much more severely affected. i think my nephew would prefer some sort of cure_ I like the theory, that Autism is the next step of human evolution.

They can be the glue, that keeps humanity away of becoming absolutely chaotic!_ Wow...I'm giving Ethan a standing ovation right now...with silent clapping._ As someone who has aspaergers spectrum I can totally agree with this. I love my way of thinking. My spectrum is definitely not a disease that needs to be cured. I don't even expect people to understand it. I enjoy understanding it myself every day.  I don't need validation or a pat on the back for it though.  I go through a lot of the same things and hardships as other people I just see them and feel them Differently.

Autism is another Human Spectrum. Including everyone enables all to grow_ Autism means being obsessed with Buffy the vampire slayer and star wars and not being able to have a 'normal' conversation but being able to go on for hours about my obsessions, being overwhelmed by music in stores, loud sudden noises, high pitched sudden noises,large crowds except when I'm with people I trust or when I keep moving or I can zone out! It also means having a really hard time communicating what I want, and having a hard time understanding what people want from me unless they really explicitly say what they want in great detail! And I can't read people's faces etc etc!_ I believe that Autism is the next step in human evolution_ Free prayer requests service is now available here on youtube comments.

As you can see with high functioning autistic people (like me), autism forms your personality. It does the same in low functioning too. It would be great to cure it for low functioning, but would they be the same person, and how would it work?_ @tezlatower2362¬† lol it has nothing do with personality. lol low levels think different that is wrong in ever sentence_ @bullrun2772¬† that's still their personality. Your personality is literally how you think, that's what makes you different._ @bullrun2772¬† by curing autism, you are entirely changing the person. You literally said it yourself.

But if there was a way to change and be normal wouldn't u want to? Ur first comment about not needing a cure made it seem like we are fine but now it seems we should just accept that we are not fine.

The document lists many flawed behaviors which allists routinely engage in, and for which they are at a distinct disadvantage as a result.\n\nSome scientists hypothesize that the real reason that allism is the most functional neurotype is merely that they are by far the most common, but that allism and possibly other neurotypes may fare just as well or better if they were in the majority instead.\n\nAs for why allism is in the majority, well I think that is explained quite thoroughly by anthropological studies of primitive human behavior and early human evolution._ @TheReaverOfDarkness¬† Ok, can you link me to that?_ @filipeflower¬† Maybe, but YouTube has a habit of deleting links immediately.

Symptoms of autism appear to be the much the same as I developed BAM one day with my brain injury. I've thought for a long time that it's likely that those diagnosed with autism were perhaps injured at birth in some way and think it would be interesting to look into how many of those said to have autism suffered a difficult birth.¬†\n\nIn other words I think that many who are diagnosed as 'autistic' actually suffered brain injury = have brain damage, but healthcare providers & medics don't want to be held liable for causing that so it's lied about, denied & covered-up - as so many healthcare harms are (including my own caused by NHS in the UK); and all healthcare providers, governments and pharmaceutical companies prefer 'mental health' diagnoses because less liability and services people with brain injury need costs so much more than e.g. online CBT and medications.\n\n Birth injuries must be prevented whenever possible - & it usually is possible, this would prevent so many babies' brains from getting damaged - 'invisible' injuries that will often only become apparent later on.\n\nI'd be interested to know if this young man (& his mum) suffered any complications at birth and whether he has ever had an MRI scan.\n\nThank you._ The nail that sticks out gets hammered down- (Japanese conformity).

Once in awhile he appears to let his \"mask\" slip and then hurriedly covers it up looking fearful that I've seen it.  I love him so much and want him to feel like he doesn't have to mask himself around me all the time.  He's told me how exhausting it is for him to mask himself.

My son is autistic and this expanded my whole world._ Is mental retardation a disease ?_ Brilliant!_ What a darling guy‚Ä¶I‚Äôd love to meet him._ Wonderful_ I think it's really important to understand that when people consider something like autism a disease, what's happening on an emotional instinctual level is a different question: Are you dangerous? You potentially being 'diseased' implies danger, and the sense of danger is what fuels people's stance towards it. So even if you can bring forth evidence of autism not being a disease, so long as you're not having the 'are autistic people dangerous?' discussion, you won't connect with the people you're trying to affect. And that sense of danger is very multi-faceted. Danger isn't just about 'Are you going to kill me?'. It's also, 'Will you embarrass me?', 'Will you make me feel insecure?', 'Will you lead to me having a lot of arguments?' or any other negative experience people will dangerously overcompensate to avoid. The notion that autism could be a disease is merely and emalgum of those worries. The clue is in the word itself, really. Dis-ease. To remove from a state of being at ease. That's where the dialogue needs to happen._ I have autism but I have an amazing sense of humor_ That's an imersive speech, I like this guy.

It‚Äôs for over 18‚Äôs but apart from that absolutely all are welcome. It will take 25-30 mins on average and is an online survey. I apologise if I should not have prospected here for participants and will hold no malice if this comment is deleted.\n\nAnyone interested if you could comment to me I‚Äôll provide the link._ It's more often a symptom of a disorder._ What does that has to do with this?_ Thats not a clinical term so I don't actually know what you meanüòÖüòÖ could you define how you're using the term 'mental retardation'? Then maybe I could help answer your question and maybe even help you find other terms to help communicate more effectively^-^_ Autism is not a disease, it's a disorder._ Your point?_ Sure_ @budgie463¬† Thank you very much but my research is now concluded. My research indicated that Empathy (measured by EQ), systemising (measured by SQ), aphantasia (measured by VVIQ) and gender (in this case male and female 'brain types') may explain up to 52% of autistic traits in the general adult population._ So well done!  You helped me understand autism a bit better._ As mum of one autistic boy and maybe to more autistic girls (so hard to get them diagnosed) I am shocked every day at the needless struggles they have to face! \n\nThey are highly intelligent and capable, but do not fit into the regular school system. One is great with computers, one a highly gifted cellist and the youngest has stunning memory and mathematic understanding. So why is it that our society prefers to look at their difficulties rather than valuing their capacities, literally excluding great people just because they are not ‚Äúeasy‚Äù to handle? Their place is neither in an institution nor in a hospital for they are neither crazy nor mentally disabled, for heaven‚Äôs sake!!!_ here's my issue with saying that ASD is not a defect or a disease that needs to be cured, if i were to offer a 100% safe cure for ATC im pretty sure 100% of autistic people would take it. being on the spectrum is astronomically difficult and there isnt really a silver lining. it just sucks. ASD is nothing to be ashamed of, of course, but let's not pretend that it's just another way of living. its a huge handy cap and we should work to cure it if we can._ I was diagnosed and honestly regarding the Pulse shooting I've not shed as many empathetic tears in years since._ Wow‚Ä¶ thank you for this video. I‚Äôm not autistic but I know all about masking. I‚Äôm not a very social person, but I have to pretend to be in order to get a decent job. I have to make sure to pick the right answers on personality tests that required to apply for jobs. It‚Äôs very stressful because I‚Äôd like to just lay back, chill and be my laid back self, but to every single employer and really most social groups, I am a horrible misfit, mindset and really have no value to their group, team or organization. I lie in order to survive._ I have autism and love technology_ ‚ÄúMy people are destroyed from lack of knowledge‚Äù_ Well, I didn't come here to learn about what Autism is and why it's \"not something you judge\" Nor did I come here to learn about the sob story (yeah, the title fooled me.. I thought I was gonna learn something about autism and  not get the moral bashing for not knowing what autism is) of how autistic people struggle to live with the (so called) \"normal\" People. Thus, I will have to dislike your video because it's a click bait at best._ It is so nice having this topic explains by someone who has it_ Amazing_ God bless you_ My 6 year old son has autism. I‚Äôve never felt more amazed at what a wonderful human being I‚Äôve created_ god bless you,ethan!_ Awesome!_ I have it too, high functioning I think. It can be a major advantage at times believe it or not. I found my niche with mathematics. But it can also suck at times because my social skills are beyond repair lol_ Terrific video! No two people with autism are the same and that's why my TED Talk is titled, \"An Autistic Genius Discusses How Differences Make Us Special.\" You're definitely someone special and I applaud your courage and your talent. Stay you and keep growing!_ Being mediocre is being very normal.  No apologies._ Medically loud music will make you concentrate less so be a bit austictic ._ It's a weird world for many but very much understandable.  Be constructive._ I still believe it needs an antropologist skill to really except differences in people._ I mean if they're autistic they are mentally disabled but other than that totally agree lol_ What are you trying to cure here, most autistic people just think different. Of course, the world hates different people, for some reason it's society's first instinct to wipe all diversity._ No silver lining? 100%?????!? Dude soooooo many autistic folks don't want a cure lmao, like, gimme a pill that helps w overstim and my hyper/hypo sensitivities? Sure, I'll take it. But no way would I take a 'cure' for autism lmao and sooo many ppl agree_ I wouldn't take it, thanks. In fact I think most wouldn't. You can't cure a personality._ That's your opinion._ Sounds like you're ignorant on this subject._ Finally someone who COMPLETELY understands me_ Thank you so much for this, I‚Äôve learnt so much._ autism is the way of nature and the brain of beautiful new human beings to say to our society \"SCREEEEEWWWW YOUUUUUUUUU I DO WHAT I WAAAANT YOU SICKO! LIFE IS HOW I WANT IT TO BE NOT HOW YOU TELL US!! GNAAAAAAA!\" and actually live like we should all do. by doing what we like and feel like doing. period._ Well said.üòÖ_ Well said really good. Forget about those bais outdated views._ ‚ÄúDefective‚Äù is not a medical term, but autism is a ‚Äúdisorder‚Äù that veers too far from established ‚Äúnorms‚Äù in one‚Äôs behavior, ability to learn, etc.  A disorder can be treated, assisting an autistic person learn to talk, sit quietly in a classroom, learn how to interact with peers and make friends (ie learn ‚Äúsocial norms‚Äù), etc. If we can help a autistic person with these things, they are able to do things like give TED talks.  \nNot long ago, society didn‚Äôt experience autistic persons, except the ones who were so high functioning that they learned to adapt or ‚Äúmask‚Äù to society.  Others were kept at home or institutionalized.  This means we weren‚Äôt exposed to autistic persons and we did not know how to interact with them.  This, of course, is not true today.  With greater awareness, interacting with persons with autism will get easier for *us.*. Thank you for sharing._ I am proud of you Ethan , and I am also thankful. You made me understand so many things .My daughter is been diagnosed at the age of 8 and I don't know how to feel... I think I am also autistic but I am here, I survived to this hostile world she is just beginning to discover this society and I am so scared_ Diagnosed aged 54 , I find this so helpful. It brought a tear to my eye. Thank you so so much._ I‚Äôm autistic and all the things he said that people think autistic people have are true for me_ I Love ‚ù§ someone with Severe Autism ‚ù§_ Research Dr tinus Smith using cease therapy.

I think i do._ It a marketing  tool  to call it disease  stimming  I call rev their mind_ thank you for your insight_ My brother has autism so I‚Äôve always kinda understood._ Love the console comparison._ As an autistic person, I've gotta say he is actually wrong in his intro, special interests are a key feature of neurodivergency and social skills do take a hit with neurodivergency. Saying this is wrong is wrong, yes they don't define us, but they are there_ I was diagnosed 2 years ago when I was 51 years old and I feel the same as you._ What kind of doctor or testing does this diagnosis?_ @JLBisHatedbyPresidentXiEven¬†I think a psychiatrist or psychologist_ Doesn't work._ so much bots_ Worth looking into^-^ do some research, even if you choose not to go for a clinical DX learning abt itself is always good_ Your point?_ @filipeflower¬† I feel like I made my point pretty clearly_ @cyanidepanda¬† Not to me._ @filipeflower¬† well he says that these views of autism are wrong, but they're key diagnostic tools and common in most neurodivergents_ @cyanidepanda¬† What views?_ You are wonderful! I‚Äôm a 50 year old woman who just realized I‚Äôm autistic.  My daughter was diagnosed almost 20 years ago and it still never occurred to me until now.  Miss diagnosed depression all these years.  When you said my inner feelings are unlimited, but my mind only lets me express extremes. That resonated so deeply inside me. Your ongoing talk about not being defective just human, is exactly what someone needs to hear when they are realizing this about themselves. I‚Äôm so thankful I watched your video. You are incredible being, and I appreciate you for your words and your bravery._ Excellent presentation._ Thank you...you have expressed it exactly as it is..._ 5:32 what was that laugh for? did he not control himself for 2 seconds?_ Hold up did I hear a fart at 1:09_ who farted at 1:10._ My sis has it..I feel bad for for the past 12 years..she loves singing and painting_ I admire him. He seems nervous, but the courage it takes to ignore that, stand up on stage and stop misinformation on autism is overpowering him._ Seems like he is talking off the cuff. Amazing job._ I mean who exactly even established this \"normal\" thingy_ Thanks for posting, very good talk. i learned a lot._ One mis-conception is/are that ALL autistic people can't stand loud sounds/noizes how-ever I can't stand all sounds/noizes but I'm fine with loudness but depends on which matireal./texture._ ‚ù§_ My sin was just diagnosed with level 3 Autism. We also knkw about sensory processing disorder...in particular he is a seeker, always seeking stimulation. Unfortunately we have been left in the dark most if the time, 90% of what I know is from personal study_ I think the only problem that people with autism have is communicating, there are people that have great communicating abilities but they are dumb, but they are so good talking that they convince and hypnotize people just by talking, autism is the opposite, people with autism are extremely intelligent but they don't have good communicating abilities, because if they did it would be unfair, extreme genious intelligence and great communicating abilities at the same time only few people have had in history, so what i'm trying to say is that people with autism are normal people, no one is perfect, like I said people are born with different traits, everyone is born different, so autism is normal, If not there should be a condition too for people with great commutication skills but extremely dumb_ another ethan what's good üëÅ üëÅ_ What he says grasps only the theoretical, we all need to productively interact to provide for our needs._ So based on this video I'm not autistic._ My family is almost all Autistic. IDK why but we are. My children all have it as well. I dont treat it as tho its an illness. Its just life to us. :)_ I have autism, diagnosed when I was 9. Growing up my mom noticed that I hated noises such as a door slamming or even just the sound of a blender (fun fact: I had a slight fear of hand dryers when I was younger). Going to a simple birthday party would cause me to ask to call my mom to come pick me up. But I‚Äôm surviving! Oh I also forgot to mention that I have ADHD too. Lately I‚Äôve been watching a bunch of autism videos and I always see the same comment: ‚ÄúIf you have autism you wouldn‚Äôt be commenting on this video‚Äù and stuff like that. I just wanted to say, autistic people are not stupid. They are human beings, and should be treated as such. It depends on where you land on the spectrum, but some autistic people, like me, are smart enough and perfectly capable of commenting and typing paragraphs, like I am right now. Please don‚Äôt make someone with autism think they are stupid! That‚Äôs all I wanted to say, thanks :)_ Probably not, i'm autistic and i have free will._ That is a very good question._ some little kid probably judging by what is considered \"normal\" and \"not normal\"_ I‚Äôm so sorry you are going through that_ btw we are all very loving and kind. Just FYI. Its crazy when people say someone who is Autistic doesnt feel. We feel sometimes WAY to much._ It's okay. Be proud of who you are._ @happymolecule8894¬† Thank you. That means a lot to me..... I am glad people are starting to see how special autism is and how amazingly smart kids and adults are that have it. We have our ups and downs but I gotta say .....My kids are SO freakin smart and I couldnt be more proud. So its like a warm hug to me when I hear you say that! It means a lot._ 'idk why' yeah, not like it's genetic or anything /lh_ My son 24, with aspergers/adhd is no longer on medication....he was on many different types when growing up to help with aggressive behavior. My question, I'd be so grateful if any young adult who reads this post could help me to better understand how to motivate him....he's addicted to computer, has no friends, but is a very friendly guy, very kind and sweet....he works part time now and has social security....I'm hoping to learn how to help him to 'care' beyond computer about himself and his life._ Well said. And yes, your hair is awesome!_ Natural Human Spectrumüëç_ Very enlightening.._ ü§ó_ An awesome and deeply moving expression of self understanding with a quiet yet steely passion that the world might learn how to think differently about autism and being autistic. Mic drop._ This will help a lot of people to understand Autism_ My bf has autism, some of my closest friends and I sometimes think my father has it._ I am an Autistic and have 2 Amazingly Autistic sons! He is wonderful! üëè_ He's good üëçüôå_ Ok at 3:30 he is talking about different things that overwhelm people on the spectrum. Personally, I am not on the the spectrum but I do have anxiety. So I do relate to these senses causing people to overwhelm._ I'm autistic and I think it feels like every other person in the world is a non-player character._ SO POWERFUL, Thank you Ethan Lisi._ I feel like i got autism watching this._ Plot twist:\n\nWe all have autism to some degree.  The spectrum is so wide that we can all literally fall onto it somewhere_ I have autism and that intro described me._ You are so amazing and I love the phrase \"Natural Human Spectrum\". It is 100 true. Autism is not a disease or a disability like unfortunately some narrow minded people call it, it is just a part of the human broad spectrum of differences that is valid and special in its own way._ I used to have a negative view autism. I mean don't get me wrong some of my best friends were/are autistic, but I viewed it as a weird thing that makes people annoying. I would think \"That person definitely has autism lmao\" or \"This autistic is kinda annoying\". \n\nThat was until I actually learned about autism and figured out that I myself am on the spectrum. Unfortunately I was just a good liar._ it's scary how so many terms on ASD include the term \"DISORDER\" why can't the terms become less scary like \"tendency\", \"propensity\" etc etc? when you think of disorder you know something is out of order and that does not seem to make a lot of  sense to people with high functioning autism!_ Autistic people are better than a majority of our sick, sick society._ I'm technically still teens but I'm autistic if that helps. My first answer is ask him lol, if he's happy as he is don't force him out of it but if he's asked for help but neither of u can figure out how to help him you could always ask me some more specific questions if that might help him?_ And you didn't mention yourself????üòÇ u get along super well w a bunch of autistics and one of ur parents might be autistic, but ur completely pnt right? /Lh_ you can get em and yourself some psychedelic product for true feeling from..._ *mycodre*_ hes on instegram¬ø                                  ¬ø_ That‚Äôs not funny_ what?_ lame._ @SkankHunt42isback¬† nah, that wouldn't work. With all those graves, where would they put your body?_ @SkankHunt42isback¬† unfortunately, that plot is occupied by the Your Mom jokes (rip 1990's), however, if your autism will allow the change in routine, we can get you a plot next to that?_ @SkankHunt42isback¬† It's already been proven scientifically that Autism isn't really a disease. Go check it out._ @SkankHunt42isback¬† Even though the evidence says otherwise_ @Ellie Reed Those people who were arguing with you are Internet trolls. Watch out._ absolutely not and this is a very harmful attitude that is frequently used to invalidate autistic people's experiences\nimplying that people who are not autistic understand what it's like_ Congrats, you just learned what a spectrum is._ EvErYoNeS a LiTtLe BiT aUtIsTiCüòÇüòÇüòÇ_ Thank you for your comment._ I gave up trying to fit in and everybody thinks I'm weird but I'm happy, except the teachers they don't like me climbing the walls._ My Circle is so small üò≠_ I have autism pall so at least i got a friend who has autism_ I have ADD_ Had I not been born with an autism spectrum disorder, I likely wouldn't have had all the trouble I had in making friends as a child, and I certainly wouldn't have had my interpersonal and sensory difficulties. But I very likely ALSO wouldn't have had, among other things, my ability to empathise from an outsider's perspective, my above-average skill for pattern recognition (the results of an IQ test I took last year confirmed that), my intensely obsessive interest in the arts and the two postgraduate degrees I've consequently acquired in that field, and most importantly and significantly, my neurotypical dad, at the end of a conversation about autism and family, thanking me for being his son (and, for that matter, he and my mum fighting for me and my siblings to this day). And I do know how hard I can be to deal with, but there is nothing I'd trade any of those blessings in for._ My whole 47 years of life I have lived with Asbergers Disease(a form of Autism), Turrets Syndrome, and Muscular Dystrophy. Most of life was very difficult around people, but I never gave up, and have continued helping others most my life. The ups and down each day is I am always alone with no friends or family support most days and I cannot drive or even own my own transportation, but I work hard on projects, learn everything I can, and very creative with Music and Art that I share each day, and still here writing this sharing my support to anyone with Autism. We are in this life together._ I have autism and I am socially awkward, say things without thinking, lack empathy, and pretty much everything you put up on that board. Being autistic has ruined all my relationships, kept me from getting a job or driving and pretty much from living a normal life. I'd give anything to get rid of my autism._ If you read this know that Jesus loves you so much,you are completely normal to Him and to me for sure :)_ This is so relatable. One time, I won a competition and I didn't know how to react when I went onstage to receive the certificate of recognition. The pictures came out weird because I was trying to pretend to smile as if I was excited. I was. But I didn't know how to show it._ 85% or so, persons with autism are males. My autistic male physician works in an all male clinic. He acted in a misogynistic manner and canceled my long term prescription for oxygen that was prescribed by my now retired female physician. I have two disunited rib fractures and it's hard to breathe. I have computed my 3D reconstruction image from CT for which I paid $60. I paid $995 for MRI but computing its 3D reconstruction is one order of magnitude more difficult. DSM-5 would be one route my physician could understand his brain disorder but I think he is lazy and stuck in a rut. With good image processing I can advertise myself to all the best surgeons, like the Communists who live in Cuba. Autism is a genetic mutation. Maybe gene sequencing is available. It was said that \"autism results from a two-point mutation\". However this fails to account for the regrettably high incidence of autism in the population. Instead autism results from a mutation that can occur in one of two places. Trust me, I'm a Ph.D.  doctor. What is published in books can be hard to follow. What is published on Youtube is easier to assimilate. The two sites for the autism mutation results in two types of autism. I looked into his MD degree. Legally it is an undergraduate degree. He also has an undergraduate degree in Molecular Biology and Biochemistry. I earned a Ph.D. in Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, so I outrank him academically by a long shot. He lacks the research background to do experimentation. Because of his autism, he has strayed into the domain of medical malpractice. Because of his autism he is unable to form Mens Rea, so it is idiotic to contemplate court proceedings._ Anyone can claim falsely to be autistic for whatever reason. What you need to be convincing is an airtight diagnosis like that given by Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Various antipsychotic drugs may be prescribed but the most expedient is cannabis if you can handle it. We used to believe autism is a rare disease, because it is written, \"autism results from a two-point mutation\". However this fails to account for the regrettably high incidence of autism in the population. Instead autism results from a mutation that can occur in one of two places. Trust me, I'm a Ph.D.  doctor.  My younger brother has autism and his autistic delusion resulted in the death of my nephew. My physician has autism and he says the most offensive things, that are offensive to my health and welfare. I will refer him to my Magnetic Resonance Imaging Professor for a Brain MRI scan. I will apply for a new physician that does not frighten me._ Bro this is so relatable. To all my fellow autistic people, autism isnt a curse its a gift_ God i absolutely hate people who pass ultimate judgements on us!_ The problem with most western analogies on ASD is that people tend to pathologize it. The problem with this attitude is that we're still trying to figure autism out but we like to seal it out with fixed diagnostics. Since ASD is a deeply rooted nature of the psyche we will never really come to a conclusion on what it really is._ On the calumny \"Autistic people don't know right from wrong,\" throughout history societies do not always respect properly thought out definitions of right and wrong. Right and wrong are usually sloppily thrown together by tradition and what everyone else is doing having been presumes right. I was nonverbal till the age of 5 and later in life I earned my PhD in both applied mathematics and mathematical physics. I cannot accept societal standards of right and wrong because they have too many contradictions and they tolerate victimizing innocent people. When I refuse to buy or eat foods that require killing animals people say I am wrong because everybody else eats meat. They demand explanation and I tell them how Heisenberg indeterminacy of exactly what chemical actions will take place in the brain of a sentient creature in manifesting consciousness proves physical free will, which establishes a dignity requiring us to apply Kant's categorical imperative to animals. Most people, especially those of limited education and culture dismiss it as invalid because \"Nobody else thinks the way you do.\" Their \"reasoning\" would never be accepted in defending a dissertation, but democracy does not have to measure up to any standards when it decides what is right or wrong. I cannot accept society as my authority on right and wrong because society chooses not to earn such authority to which it aspires._ üòÖüòÖüòÖüòÖthey are really better person_ I feel like I turn autistic when I‚Äôm high_ The alleles for autism overlap the alleles for higher intelligence that those who have higher intelligence have whether they are also autistic or not. We autistic people are just neurologically different. And, the cool thing about us is that most of us tend to be more trustworthy, and to be hard workers. We tend to have higher analytical skills than most people and are problem solvers. Sure, we get overstimulated by too much stimuli. But. If you work with that about us and about our communication differences, and have patience with us, you will get to know us to see we are kind and caring, too, just a little different, but we can help society via the working world, if we allowed to do so._ wonder who was diagnosed first - him and then his mother since she felt he was getting all the attention?\nWamnx can do that sometimes_ I guess since he can talk he doesn't want a \"cure\" for those that will never do so..._ How did you get two postgraduate degrees? I feel kind of jealous, since I am only working on my first undergraduate degree (in arts and humanities).\n\nSadly I only have a very average brain and average abilities, so I don't get to brag like you do_ @unicorntomboy9736¬† I got them, sincerely, with painstaking work and a lot of help._ @jarredkennedy6131¬† Most peaple I have encountered only ever got one undergraduate degree. I didn't think that was possible_ @unicorntomboy9736¬† Not if you study two different disciplines._ There are other ways to handle that._ @filipeflower¬† lol bruh he probably has autism not like you_ Your point being?_ What exactly are you trying to say?_ Precious, mild mannered soul!!!_ So..how many people realised that the loud cheering and clapping was stressful to the guy?_ the porblem is human fear and regection of what it doesn't understand. The problem is society, portraying differences as a scary thing, and only showing \"failure\" and the \"negative aspects\" of differences, may it be adhd, autism, or even conditiosn and illnesses. If society would show the real human nature behind conditions and differences, portray human traits and not fear, we'd be much stronger and much wiser. In the news, movies, documentaries; whatever difference, illness, condition a person may have, they always portray it in a way that it looks scary, alien, etc. This gives people the impression that it's not going to happen to them ever, because it's not of this planet, it's not human, and that if someone has it around them they're alien, not human, and scary.\r\nThis needs to be switched with the focus of empowering people, showing the nature of humanity in all it's forms. Showing a very humanistic side of things,  a very relatable side of things, so everybody will feel connected rather than disconnected._ I have also autistic_ I applaud you sir for being a voice for people like my son. And you do have beautiful hair! That made me smile thank you for this speech, superb job._ When I was a kid I figured out that if I just pretend and act like everybody else I would get in less trouble , it worked ..till it didn't_ Autism has been around since the beginning of humankind. A study based on a genome-wide association study of ASD conducted by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium and information regarding evolutionary gene selection showed that inherited variants linked to ASD were found under positive selection in larger numbers than would have been expected by chance. Variants that have a large negative impact on reproductive success are generally eliminated from the population quickly. However, common variants that occur with high frequency but small effect can cumulatively have big impacts on complex inherited traits ‚Äî both positive and negative.  If variants provide a better chance of survival, they are positively selected, or tend to stay in the genome through generations. Many of the positively selected variants associated with ASD identified by the researchers were enriched for molecular functions related to creation of new neurons. We are important. We should be accepted as human and not as diseased. We do not need to be fixed. Society needs to learn to be more accepting and compassionate towards those who ~seem~ different._ Yes, autism might be seen as a disability, but that doesn‚Äôt always if at all mean that it can take any common skills away from whomever it chooses. I have high-functioning autism, and when I found cerebral fitness games from HAPPYneuron and sometimes Lumosity, I noticed that it was just harder for me to develop such skills and therefore also to stop having ‚Äúspecial needs.‚Äù_ I think the best way I can describe autism is a little kid in a big kid‚Äôs body.(at least for me)_ One thing to keep in mind is : If you meet one person with autism, you've met ONE person with autism. Everyone is different, and it's important to realise autism is used for huge range of people. Some are very successful and have great love lives, while others are devastated they can barely function. There can also be people with multiple diagnosed conditions. Some desperately do need a cure or some kind of treatment, others do not.The issues are complex, so it is essential to deal with the autistic as unique individuals and not make judgments or assumptions until you get to know them._ How's the white matter in your corpus callosum?_ Thank you bro for sharing.\nYou are having right mindset._ This guy is so cute and shy so I just wanna hug him_ This guy is wonderful_ i have  autism and id rather not have it. sometimes id rather not think about world war two every day of my life._ The human race simply would not have advanced to where it is today without autism. Einstein, Tesla, Isaac Newton as well as some of the richest and most successful individuals in the world such as Elon Musk and Bill Gates all are on the spectrum!_ It's also gross oversimplification to label autism as a \"different way of looking at the world\", as any outsider, or dare I say 'neurotypical' person, will never understand the complexities and intricacies of an autistic person by that simple and seemingly innocent statement. People who simply \"think different\" would not be susceptible to life-inhibiting traits, the inability to form friendships or relationships, be chronically unemployed, and at risk of suicide and lower life expectancies than 'normal' people. To say that the statement does an injustice is a massive understatement._ The x box/play station was such a great analogy!!!!!_ Brilliant! Thanks for such an insightful and interesting talk.‚ò∫Ô∏è_ Great talk! But to all those that cheered so loudly at the end, all I could think was ‚Äúcome on he literally just said he doesn‚Äôt like loud noises.‚Äù_ Thank you for that comment._ this seems a little biased_ @bullrun2772¬† How?_ I am autistic as well and I don't think everyday about World War 2.

Although historians are pretty confident that Isaac Newton most likely was._ @psychedelictacos9118¬† i never saw them as that they were just gifted in their talents so is everbody else. people are just confusing gifted and autism in these people. also elon did just to get attention on him because of him buying twitter_ ok boomer_ @luis9639¬† Uh, yeah, that doesn't work here._ @FlyboyHelosim¬† What exactly is your point?_ @filipeflower¬† Um, my point is that it paints a rather innocent and oversimplified picture of what autism actually is. Therefore not allowing people who know nothing about it to treat sufferers incorrectly, which could lead to catastrophic results._ @FlyboyHelosim¬† Oh, okay. By the way, I'm autistic._ @filipeflower¬† Me too._ @FlyboyHelosim¬† And I have a job and a girlfriend as well_ @filipeflower¬† That's good._ I was recently diagnosed with Asperger syndrome which is on the autism spectrum. I I didn't embrace it from the beginning because I didn't want to be viewed differently by my family and other people. But now I learned to live with it. It's just soooo awesome the things you can do that other nonautistic people can't do. I feel very special and you should too. üòä_ The worst audience ever. He just said he does not like loud noise and then everyone screams and claps hands_ I'm an attractive man who's also muscular.

I, too, have to educate others on reality versus stereotypes, and have produced several YT videos just offering my firsthand perspective. I keep on saying that I believe when all of us come together, this world will be a much better place, and people can finally accept each other for who they are (not just be aware). I support your endeavor and keep up the outstanding work, Ethan!_ I couldn‚Äôt agree more with his intro. Autism is not a mental illness is a social disorder that involves difficulty in communication, social interaction ,  repetitive behaviour and  perhaps hypersensitivity._ I have autism too lol_ 0:50 Dude he described me_ Im also aspergers and I agree. It may not always be great but there are many positives!_ It's not dead, it's just underplayed._ Speak for yourself._ I have no memory. He's extraordinary._ I'm on like buds of trees and the swaying of trees. I can be the wind, or sick. It's up to you/them. So it's them, and I can't stand these idiots. We need to reimagine our space._ Stemming isn't wrong. It's an action. You stand next to me. If you give another name, then you are truly lower_ Thumbs down, just for your intro_ you are not diseased... the sleep problems should  be cured, that is the disease., also food sensitivities_ that playstation and zbox comparison is really good I'll definitely use that from now on_ \"Some people think because of our ability to mask, that this is a cure to autism. However, all it really does it make us ashamed of showing our true selves\" \nAdded to liked videos_ We need people in the UK to understand that autism comes in all shapes. No one individual is the same and there is a spectrum to autism._ has anyone else tried sleeping on gold leaf? :-))_ Briliant!_ I will be lonely forever not being able to connect with anyone so I‚Äôm going to be the rich single auntie_ My four year old has been diagnosed levels 2 and 3 on the spectrum (3 being the highest). He is the happiest, kindest and most gentle child. He stims when he is excited and I love it, it‚Äôs a physical expression of how he is feeling. He has a significant speech delay and didn‚Äôt really speak until he was three, but he remembers the names of hundreds of species of animals and loves listing things. I‚Äôve been told when he starts school the teachers will be making sure the kids know the alphabet and how to count to ten, my child has known both since he was 1 year old and currently can count up to 340. Amazing right? But if you asked him a question that we haven‚Äôt practiced (like what he ate today or what his favourite part of the day was) he won‚Äôt be able to answer you. My child is autistic, but he is just as wonderful and valid as any other child. My hope is that he makes some kind friends that love him and know to take the lead in the friendship, boss him around in a loving way because my son wants friends, he just doesn‚Äôt know how to talk to them_ I was diagnosed with autism on my 20th bday. I dropped out of different schools before my diagnosis, because I thought I was simply \"dumb\". The diagnosis felt like a weight lifted off my shoulders. Knowing how my mind works has helped me a lot throughout the years and Ethan here described autism accurately. Honestly a video I'd recommend to people who don't know that much about autism._ It‚Äôs weird. The majority of my friends are ASD and it‚Äôs so clear to me that they show TONS of empathy. It‚Äôs the neurotypical folk who lack empathy, IMO. They tend to be more disingenuous in showing their empathy. But again, everyone has different experiences with folk._ I once spoke to a person who didn't know I had autism at first, and she talked to me in a seemingly natural way. About a few months later, she started talking to me in a more cautious, mindful way, and that gave me the suspicion that she found out about my autism somehow. This situation here is the reason why I rarely bring up the fact that I have autism. People might change the way they talk to me even though they really don't need to, and it makes me disappointed to know that they might think that I can't handle a normal conversation. In other words, if I reveal that to certain people, then that just changes EVERYTHING apparently._ Hard to watch, but worth it_ Hermoso mensajeüôÇ_ Love the PlayStation/XBox analogy.  Both highly capable systems but they process information differently._ Dios vaya puntos pringaos_ I am autistic too. We all differ a bit. I don't mind loud noises and I love going to concerts. Although I hate dance clubs for the most part. It's not usually my type of music. I'll be the guy blasting my rock music down the road in my car. However I do feel somewhat awkward interacting with people at times. I was very much a stereotypical autistic kid. Now as a young adult I have quirks that I definitely identify as an autistic. I was also diagnosed with ADHD at the same time as my autism diagnosis in kindergarten_ *stimming_ zbox_ one is always better than the other_ @i_likemen5614¬† That depends on what you want really._ Also, the 'mask' has to drop at some point because keeping it on is emotionally draining. In order to be a 'cure' it would have to be sustainable, indefinitely. And even then that only covers up a person's traits just enough to get by in a social setting. Social inadequacies are not necessarily even a big part of autism for some people._ Yess also masking is so so so Turing It's like a fulltime job_ That part_ You're not the only one, here I am from Chile in Latin America, which makes it even harder_ Be careful. Please just accept him for who he is or you'll traumatize him. You have an advantage here knowing that he is autistic. Don't force him to mask._ Same with my son.._ I was the wird kid in my class untill they found out I was autistic and they started acting like I had some cronic brain disease üòîüòîüòî_ @pietersfilms5171¬† Did they treat you like a toddler?_ @glenwicks4976¬† yeah ._._ @pietersfilms5171¬† Well that's just cruel._ @glenwicks4976¬† That's why activism is necessary._ @filipeflower¬† Yep._ Yes_ Everyone should be different_ Thank you for being brave and sharing your story!_ Thank you for this ‚ù§Ô∏è You‚Äôre a beautiful human being_ I'm autistic.  Diagnosed as a child.\n\nWhat does autism mean for me?\n\nAutism is living as an alien ambassador on a strange world with different customs.  You look similar to these aliens but you don't say things the same or hear things in the same way.  Everything is louder and brighter on this planet.  \n\nThese aliens don't speak the same or have quite the same mannerisms, but you do your best to match them as a good ambassador should.  \n\nBut wearing that mask is tiring.  Being around them for long periods takes so much effort.  And everything is so loud and bright.  You need time to recharge and let your body destimulate.\n\nBut sometimes it's too much anyway, and your mask breaks, and you mess up.  Or it goes horribly wrong and your mask shatters altogether and you become extremely emotional. A meltdown.\n\nThat is what my autism is in part._ This actually did to me the opposite of what it was intended for non-autisric people_ The up side to having autisme is no lines at amusement parks for me._ If it is David Bowey or John travolta even Nirvana I am ok._ Like him. Loud noises can bug me, but it is only the case if there are a lot of people are around._ I am autistique. People d‚Äôont realize that I can‚Äôt ignore them. It can be difficult for me._ NO THANK YOU... I tell people we are NOT defective we are differently brained. I think we have an upgraded brain actually :D more evolved for the world of the future._ We are the meek, and we shall inherit the earth._ As a diagnosed autistic person, I‚Äôm actually a highly sensitive person and people don‚Äôt tend to notice that I am autistic. What I always do is copying behavior of other humans in order to ‚Äúfit in‚Äù. I go to a special school for children that drop out of high school because there‚Äôs something that happend to them. I can function normally just like neurotic people and live a very happy life._ Mahalo Ethan! I ‚Äúyoutubed‚Äù how to speak with an autistic person and your video popped up.  Your sincerity and transparency helped me immensely to alleviate my apprehension to engage with autistic people. ü§ôüèª_ Thank you friend with all my heart and soul!_ 20k show support\n321 people disliked this video, therefore not only refuse empathy but don't accept the info & speaker.\nDescision of dislike is critical_ It's not a disease but it's a negative for sure_ John Doyle_ ADORABLE. what a beautiful spoken man._ All thanks to Godüôè and Dr Oziengbe on YouTube. He was able to cure my only child that was suffering from Autism with the herbal medicine I order from Dr Oziengbe._ I have been harder struggles in my life I am also have autismüò™_ lol upgarded brain this just wrong_ bruh this is stupid_ yeah i have autism myself and it pisses me off when people say its a good thing even though it really isnt. All people do by saying it's a good thing is make it seem as if it's easy to live with even though it makes life extremely hard not knowing how to interact with people_ @millitarecho664¬† You tell that to the great amount of autistic people who have successful lifes._ @filipeflower¬† Those \"successful\" people might not live with the same challenges that other autistic people do, since it's such a broad spectrum. If you are happy with your autism and can embrace it, rock on!  But that doesn't mean it's your place to invalidate other people's experiences. This person's feelings are just as real and valid as yours._ @brockhampton3078¬† Wait, what is this?_ @millitarecho664¬† yeah and just don't want to face the truth_ @bullrun2772¬† What truth?_ @filipeflower¬† wow dude I don‚Äôt care anymore this was months ago if you are still pissed at me well get a life_ @bullrun2772¬† I do have a life, but that thing you claimed doesn't respond to anything._ Please\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop_ @ruler_of_everything¬† I will not stop I need to let people know that Dr Oziengbe natural herbal medicine product is a blessing to treat and cure Autism completely_ @elizabethbetty4959¬† why is a bettle your profile pic?_ @ruler_of_everything¬† fyf_ I have autism and djing is the best thing tat happend to me cuz thats how I found out that I cant cancel out background noise for example  when 2 songs are mixed (only headphones when your matching the beats ) I cant focus just on 1 track I always here them together .other example is when 2 people are talking to me I cant ignore the other one  but Ilike big partys with alot of  lights and loud music  but thats thenice thing about autism theres not one exaple of autism_ s_ This feels as if the first self-conscious AI is trying to present himself in front of humans_ I have a autism and I see the world as sad_ The stench of certain food and people, and the sound does irritate me. \n\nThat's why I avoid the urban areas._ Good job Cliff Burton!!_ There seems to be a misunderstanding among high-functioning autistic people about a search for a cure.  It's not for you, it's for the low-functioning autistic people that, once fully grown adults, become a danger to their caretakers and/or are at high risk for abuse.  Those people would see significant quality-of-life improvement if cognitive function could be improved._ Amazinggggg Thank You Soooo Muchhh for Your Story Your Strength and Your Posture! We Love You and No You're Not diseased You are a Miracle_ Many high functioning adults have autism. The way you can tell is by asking them \"logic\" questions.Where i live i would use one simple question. I would ask, would you be more likely to be attacked or robbed at the south Michigan Street McDonalds which has had hundreds of incidents or would you be more likely to be attacked at the South Miami Street McDonalds that is in a good area and has really no incidents. The person with Autism will answer you have the same chance of having trouble at either of them The normal person will answer the one in the bad area naturally._ Most autistic people are male and most westerners are white. Sucks to see the left infect everyone with their idea pathogens.\n\nI know some of you will want to respond with pseudo ignorance. But I don't respond to fake ignorance._ hope i wasnt the only one that thinks this kinda looks like an adult swim set_ I disagree, autism is a disorder and we should find a cure._ I mask so much, even Drs don't believe me! But I find a psychologist who is willing to listen and tell them everything about me and boom they know exactly the issue! I basically have every trait of autism, and I've learned to function the best way possible. No one else can do it for me. So I'm blessed and happy to be autistic, and u should also!_ üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëåüëåüëåüëå_ Autistic people just operate at a different frequency, than non-autistic people. Studies have shown that some people with autism remember better, and are a lot more attentive/detail oriented._ Thankyou so much for this video! My son is on the spectrum of autism and he 14 years old hearing you and seeing you explain this gives me more insight to what he may or may not be going through that I may not understand. Keep up the great videos !ü•≤_ GODBLESS HIM he is a fucking BRAVE guy!

A neurotypical one!_ @filipeflower¬† prove that hes wrong right now_ @bullrun2772¬† Look, whoever you are, please stop stalking my comments. I have my job to worry about now and I don't have any obligation to waste my time with this. Best wishes for you._ disagree tho your mix up the truth_ @bullrun2772¬† Got anything to debunk that?_ üëçüëç_ He‚Äôs amazing. I myself would not have been able to give such a beautiful walkthrough demo or talk about Autism. Great job, I‚Äôm so impressed! üëèüèª_ I argue that autism is not a disease. This guy may function well, but there are others, who cannot even speak. If the inability of speaking is \"just another way of thinking\", than what a disease is? The mild cases (like this guy) is just the not-so-intense version of the same problem._ I've decided tobe very open about being autistic.  A few hours ago I told a man that lives in my building that I am autistic.   He said he thought so by the way I move my eyes around when I talk to him.  It blew me away how good it felt that he knew and didn't treat me differently for the months that I've known him!_ dont say that autism is just \"different way of looking at things\"  its very insulting for all those parents and kids who go thru so much trouble ..who suffer because of the symptoms ..just because u got on a TED stage does not mean that u can say anything and it wd b considered true ...tomorow somebody would say that SCHIZOPHRENIA is also not a disorder ..its just a \"DIFFERENT WAY OF LOOKING AT WORLD\"_ What a brave an intelligent young man. Thank you._ He has long hair because he probably has severe sensory issues_ As an autistic person i can relate to what this guy said, and the way of how he's speaking too. I never realized something is wrong with me before the teen age, and then i did, and then... realizing that something is wrong with me and how i think and see the world is wrong.. it's just overwhelming and depressing. I feel like this world is so alien to me, and i'm alien to it. I still don't think i'm weird or something, but i just often feel being out of place.. My speeches are always a \"word salad\" tho, guess people find that annoying...._ When I was younger, people told me I might be autistic.\n\nWatching this I know I am definitely autistic._ anyone saying low functioning autism is horrible and should be treated if possible, is just willingly blind_ Continues to talk basically monotone lol_ You are speaking so truthfully. These things are so true._ Yes actually means no\nbut SENTENCE = SENTENCE .\n\nHereby I pray for the innocent ones in jail to be released._ i hate it when people with 1/10 of my intelligence notice it and talk to me like i am a toddler._ The title should say what it‚Äôs really like to be autistic, the vast majority of autistic people (including myself) use this to describe ourselves because, at least personally, autism is me._ The people that disliked this video need help..._ The masking stuff made me tear up. I have autism and it takes everything in me to try and hide it. Most people when I tell them I have ASD, they almost don‚Äôt believe me because I‚Äôve gotten so good at hiding it. I was bullied a lot when I was younger and I had to try to hide how I was in order to not get bullied as much._ I hope there's a heart button here :) ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è_ I can't stand the sound of skateboarding or the feeling of cold fresh air on my skin._ \"I can only communicate in extremes or nothing\".\n\nYeah, that is me!_ Try reading about Autism on the NHS U.K website._ ‚Äã¬†@filipeflower¬† Both you and I know that is not reasoning, just a well known ugly trick; you're saying that I'm so dumb that it is not worth to answer me.\nStill, I know a lot about autism, I even know two autist people. I agree that well-functioning autists are just a bit wired, not ill people, but there are many badly functioning ones at the other end of the spectrum. Autism is a serious mental disease for them, isn't it? If you disagree, please use reasons this time._ @MrEnyecz¬† Like I said, read about Autism from trustworthy sources, specially the ones written by actually Autistic people. I didn't claim you were dumb. Don't accuse me out of random, please._ @MrEnyecz¬† Try reading about Autism from Associa√ß√£o Portuguesa Voz do Autista. There's an english version there._ @filipeflower¬† Those having autism and capable to write (what I can read as you say) are those called \"well-functioning\". I was speaking about the poorly functioning ones, who cannot even speak. This guy says, autism is just another way of thinking, not a disease. I'm saying that for the poorly functioning autists, this is definitely a serious disability, a mental disease._ @MrEnyecz¬† Are those terms written by the World Health Organization?_ @filipeflower¬† I don't know, probably not. And now what? Authoritarianism is a well known argument error (your second error!), please do not do it. Especially when the authority cited is so much full with politics, like WHO.\nFor me a condition causing a serious disability is an illness. This is not a shame. I don't hate ill people, I accept them as is. Of course,  you can say, no, this is not illness but \"foo\" or \"bar\" or whatever nice word you find out. OK, then call it a foo or bar, this is just some magic with the words._ @MrEnyecz¬† Still unanswered by the anti-autism individual (you). What's the problem here?_ @filipeflower¬† LoL! Concluding that I'm \"anti-autism individual\" based on things like \"I don't hate ill people, I accept them as is\" is a bit hard, isn't it?\nBut to answer your question: I had no problem. I just noted that this guy was wrong as, at least in serious cases, autism is not just \"another way of thinking\", it is an illness. Then, for my perspective, a random social justice warrior came out of the blue and told me that I'm an \"anti-autism individual\" just because what I think. But still, I don't have problems with autists, I just pointed out that this guy was wrong._ @MrEnyecz¬† Actually, it's already been proven scientifically that Autism is not a mental illness. It's a neurological diversity. That's why it cannot be cured. If you really researched about that, you'd know this by now._ ‚Äã¬†@filipeflower¬† Let me see this proof! We are arguing about  definition, so neither of us can have a solid proof. :) However, a definition can be bad in a way that it becomes containing too many corner cases, or it may indicate serious consequences none of us want.\nWhat kind of consequences? For example, if autism is not an illness, health care system and health insurance can easily say that developing autistic children is not their business. And if you start thinking on it, you can find out many similar problems immediately..._ @MrEnyecz¬† How long have you been studying Autism?_ @MrEnyecz¬† It's been 8 days and no reply from you. What's the problem here?_ @filipeflower¬† lol wow you are a troll_ @MrEnyecz¬† Now it's been 3 months and still no reply. It's safe to assume you're not an expert on that subject._ yaeh so true_ lol what did you just say. this so wrong_ lol wow so you can't cope with other people opinions_ @bullrun2772¬† Neither can you apparently._ Always remember to repent of your sins (sin is transgression of YAHUAH The Father In Heaven‚Äôs LAW: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, & Deuteronomy) And Have Belief On Yahusha The Messiah.

At the school they did not want him they fought with me for years by bullying me intimidating me sending false reports about my child so they can make me take my kid out of the school. N.B. the kid is a quiet and good kid not agressive. \nThey just did not want my child because the child has autism and they see it as problem for them so they did to us the most unkind horrible stuff. Psychological war, putting the kid in separate classroom or outside. People have done to me and him the most horrible stuff just because of autism. That was their excuse. Things i would have never imagined myself to do to anyone. I have met all of human cruelty because of my child s condition. I also entered a relationship with a person wouter van der g who i later realised only wanted to use me for free roof free food and to bring his dad to my country. And all this because his dad gerard van der g and grandma helen van sha were telling him i worth nothing because i give birth to autist kid. All these while i have found job to wouter gave him a place to live for free and cooked for him each day while i even cured an std he got cheating on me with a woman his dad gerard van der ga told him to sleep with. Also wouter van der ga has beaten me on several occasion when he wanted to go out with other women while living in my property becayse as his dad told him i worthed nothing because i have an autist child. When i took wouter to courts for his beatings and the damages to my property he has done, he put a girlfriend of his to call on social services on me on false accusations that my kid eats from the garbages. Imagine we are talking about wouter van der ga a guy who was eating each day at my house fresh food i cooked for him and he was seeing the food was fresh for him and my kid with my money. This van der ga family lived in middelburg until they came in my country on my expenses in my property. To add to this my family mother and father does not let me date anyone or have any friend. My mother never keeps my child while she keeps my sisters children._ \"Low functioning autistic\" people do have a disability._ ü§† From my understanding, what he's talking about with the senses are part of what is called nervous system overdrive. It IS pathological. Not just another neurovariant. Just because he has autism doesn't mean he doesn't understand the biological causes. \nThe symptoms and manifestations CAN be remedied with healing the nervous system (and then learning social skills to catch up with behavioral development). \nAutism is associated with injury to the nervous system. There are various causes and can be multifactorial._ Autism: I express my emotions in my own way instead of in the way everybody learns to\nAllism: If it's not my way, I refuse to see it.

Instead of trying to understand how the autistic sees things. The thing is that the Autistic cannot change to be more like them._ My son and daughter both have autism.

My son and daughter even though are young people know they are different within minutes._ Would be helpful if you could share what all therapies you went through ? As a child and till now ?_ I find living with autism/Aspergers to be far more genuine and unique than how the masses live their unimaginative, unoriginal, bland and boring life.\nI'd rather spend my time with those who do not \"fit in\", than the insufferable robots who call themselves \"normal\"._ Happy to see an actual autistic talking about it and not just another \"autism mommy warrior\" or Special Ed ABA enthusiast._ When he said ‚ÄúWhen I‚Äôm masking most of the time people don‚Äôt realize I‚Äôm autistic until I give them the Big Reveal‚Äù and then he does a little laugh as the crowd was silent,\nI laughed along with him and made me realize if it was a room full of autistic people we probably all would‚Äôve giggled along because it‚Äôs almost like having to ‚Äúcome out‚Äù as autistic lol_ I have asd, which is mild autism, my parents never put me on any medications and while i had lots of difficulties younger on, i  can definitely say ive progressed a long way, i dont see it as a disability, just taking skill points from some areas and adding it to others_ India has the largest number of autistic children (851,000), followed by China (422,000), Nigeria (207,000),  and Indonesia (159,000). Vaccination rates are often low in these regions, further refuting already debunked claims about a link between vaccines and autism._ Autism is definitely Human, even a separate species of human, what is NOT human is the pervasive world poisoning creating neurological/immune system disruptions mimicking autistic symptoms, there lies the dramatic increases ~~_ Yes, absolutely autism is another way of thinking.  There was a time when I wished I could be more like other people, but now I'm very happy to be the way I am.  Woooooooooo-hoooooooooooh!!!!!!!  (Sorry, forgot to mask for a second there...)  I've been working on a particular creative project for several years, 100% focused on it, committed to it and excited about it, and I have the strong feeling that if I were \"neuro-typical,\" I would have given up on this thing a long time ago._ Your courageous and beautiful ...and I love your hair, reminds me of my grandson, he has beautiful hair too‚ù£Ô∏è lol ... and thank you for your speech, it really helps me to understand a little more about him as well and that is a very special gift üíù_ My autism makes it so I hate loud noise and can‚Äôt handle it that well so I get really tired from being outside by the city because of all the loud cars. I once had a sensory overload in a restaurant because a baby was crying really loud._ I‚Äôm 35 and beginning the journey to understanding autism.

I have been cracking up the whole time while the audience is silent. I just make jokes for me lol_ I'm so glad we're talking about this. Because same. And it got me thinking about the way we autistics have a different kind of humour. Not sure if you all feel this way aswell, but in the beginning he was like \"people think an autistic person is a white male, speaking in monotone, going on and on about the same topic\" while standing there as a white male, speaking monotone, about to go on about autism. To me it's irony, because those first three things he named are how people will perceive him and they're so wrong for that. And he just blatantly pointed them out. Followed up by the \"because I'm autistic\" is also funny, because I'm pretty sure that was clear at that point after pointing some ironic things out about a certain topic he seems to be a professional on. But no one in the crowd laughed, so now I felt like I'm laughing at his disability, while I'm literally autistic myself lol_ Yeah I felt that in my soul. He even gave a quick look to the virtual audience to see if anyone else shared that humor. I went 27 years undiagnosed, having to mask constantly, so this whole video made me emotional. My wife had a hard time believing it at first until I started masking less around her. My son was also diagnosed with ASD which helped solidify my proclamation._ @emmaoelius¬† I saw the irony right away and couldn't help but laugh._ Yep. And that's the one time, when it slips out who I really am, I am laser focused on their perception of me because suddenly I realize, they may have just seen ME._ Lol sameeee_ SAME i thought that was so funny_ A friend of mine didn't even know I was autistic for about a year after I met him, only first learning about it when the subject came up while chit chatting._ @lopsidedoreos¬† how has it been for you?_ Yep._ I laughed and then felt bad because no one else was laughing._ I laughed too ü§£ I'm autistic._ If I was there I would've shouted: Spot on brother! Spot on!_ @emmaoelius¬† Exactly! Hahahaaha. I was thinking about the same thing. The audience was like \"‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶\"\n\nDon't worry, you are not laughing because he's autistic, you're laughing because of the irony and the 'no reaction' of the audience. I laughed too. We understand each other better because we think similarly, if not exactly the same.\n\nAlso, I hope he got the message across from his first lines. That stereotype he pointed out is itself powerful already. If people think like we do, they would've understood already._ Yeah I once mentioned autistic masking and 'coming out' and half the group laughed and half had no idea what I was talking abt lol_ Same. I still am sobbing though_ Autistic humor is often lost on NT. It seems to be different. I have noticed I find things from autistic creators funnier than NT creators. (am on the spectrum myself)_ I‚Äôm not autistic but I found the same things he said funny. I was confused on why the crowd was so quiet! Lol In my mind I was thinking ‚Äú it was a little funny ‚Äú I started to laugh , but when crowd went quiet I stop lol ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è_ This guy is hilarious and the audience was just ‚Äúüò∂‚Äù confirming to myself that I‚Äôm autistic because he‚Äôs someone I‚Äôd very much get along with._ I do love the big reveal, I guess you could say I have something of a flare for drama_ Hi. I have to wear a mask too sometimes. I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder and light autistic spectrum disorder. After years of wearing a mask (depressive phases) I am now very good at it. üôà. Sometimes the asd kicks in and then I am wearing a mask too. Some of my colleagues didn't know either of my depressions or asd.... I am really happy that my 7 year old son, who is an asperger autist, does not have to wear a mask at home and gets every help (we could get) to live a good and joyful life.... And yes, I laughed. üòä_ Its weird.. I felt uncomfortable at that moment when he giggled but the audience was quiet.. What was that? Was I feeling awkward for him or the audience?_ They were silent because it‚Äôs obvious he‚Äôs autistic. There is no ‚Äúreveal.‚Äù_ I know how it feels to say stuff with no reaction. Socialising is extremely hard._ reading this comment and all the replies, i gotta say i didn't laugh at all nd i still don't exactly understand whats there to laugh about_ @lopsidedoreos¬† I can imagine it must feel great to not have to mask at home as much with your wife. I was curious if you wouldn't mind if I asked a question. My son was diagnosed with Autism when he was about 2 years old because he was not reaching his milestones in time. He is now a happy little 6 year old and has yet to become verbal. I had some genetic testing done via a blood drawing for him years ago. I was informed that his Autism was not genetic. I mask a lot and have trouble socially. But it is a bit scarry to \"come out possible autistic\" to other my family and husband. How were you diagnosed at a later age? How did they reach such a diagnosis? Thank you and I know you may not want to answer and that is ok too. But I'd love it if you did because people do not talk about it enough._ @idontcare2851¬† How much are you willing to bet on that?_ @idontcare2851¬† \"If you have a husband, you probably don't have autism\"? That comment only shows your ignorance. I've already met autistic couples on real life._ @idontcare2851¬† LMAO you couldn't be more wrong if you tried._ @lopsidedoreos¬† That Idont Care user has been doing nothing but spamming anti-Autism comments everywhere._ @filipeflower¬† he needs to show us on the doll where the autistic person hurt him_ @lopsidedoreos¬† The doll?_ @idontcare2851¬† I actually am. Why do you ask?_ @lopsidedoreos¬† Don't post your diagnosis. That user is trolling you._ @filipeflower¬† don't worry, I won't. Theres no need to validate myself to a nobody on the internet üòÇ_ @idontcare2851¬† post your high school diploma first. Just kidding I know you don't got one üòÇüòÇüòÇ_ @lopsidedoreos¬† Good answer._ @chereipeach345¬† I found it funny when he said people don‚Äôt know he‚Äôs autistic until he gives them the ‚ÄúBig Reveal‚Äù as in, ‚ÄúI am autistic‚Äù and it feels like having to come out of the closet as autistic. (I am queer as well so maybe that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs also funny? Idk)\n\nThe Big Reveal was funny to me in the wording, because it‚Äôs true, it feels like having to come out as autistic and it‚Äôs this BIG REVEAL to allistic people, & allistic people tend to be like ‚Äúoh my gosh! I didn‚Äôt know you were autistic! You don‚Äôt look autistic/act like an autistic person!‚Äù Because they don‚Äôt actually have a working idea of autism aside from the stereotypes, so it just feels like a big deal expressing to someone your neurotype especially if they don‚Äôt even know that different neurotypes exist.\n\nI understand the context in and of itself doesn‚Äôt seem like a joke, I tend to laugh at things I find relatable and I also just laugh a lot, it‚Äôs almost like a vocal stim for me. I also genuinely find a lot of things funny/silly that other people don‚Äôt really laugh at lol.\n\nIt‚Äôs jus silly in my opinion!\nHowever, humor is subjective and you don‚Äôt necessarily need to find it funny at all! Even if it‚Äôs relatable. It just personally gave me a laugh because I relate to that entirely on a soul level and if I were in the crowd I would‚Äôve giggled along with him because it‚Äôs relatable and I thought his wording was spot on surrounding that feeling. Whether he was delivering a joke or not, I still find it funny because of personal experiences and relatability._ @genderqueertears2675¬† okay i get it now i think. i'm queer as well so i get the coming out part now lol_ I am not autistic, but I felt guilty coz I thought internally\"dude I can tell you are autistic from miles away\" I didn't think he was joking_ Same. In the parts that he giggled i did too, but then it was kinda awkward bc nobody was laughing‚Ä¶_ Imagine believing autistic people are well known for their ‚Äúsocial masking skills‚Äù\nüòÇ really?_ @emmaoelius¬† i‚Äôm neurotypical and saw the irony right away. Bernie Sanders used a similar line in his primaries :)  i think people didn‚Äôt want to laugh at it because it wasn‚Äôt a joke, it‚Äôs a very serious subject. and people certainly don‚Äôt want to make the speaker uncomfortable, so laughter is usually very reserved unless the joke is very obvious and we know we are allowed to laugh_ as a neurotypical i will say- yes, the ‚ÄúBig Reveal‚Äù was humorous, but we don‚Äôt giggle out loud at everything we find slightly humorous, especially something we cognitively understand but cannot empathize with from personal experience. the joke REALLY resonated with autistic people viscerally because it‚Äôs personal, it describes their experience, which is why it‚Äôs simply funnier for them._ @PutinsMommyNeverHuggedHim¬† Your point being?_ I laughed too!  And I don‚Äôt get many jokes‚Ä¶. I take them too literally_ true_ @emmaoelius¬†he is the stereotypical autistic person‚Ä¶semi weird (to the rest of the world they‚Äôre calling it quirky) monotone (cuz its either extremes or nothing) white male and for him to have to explain that ‚Äúits because i‚Äôm autistic‚Äù is redundant to the stereotype. normal society has zero understanding of what it means to be autistic cuz autism is a spectrum and we‚Äôre all unique on the spectrum just like all ‚Äúnormal people‚Äù are unique it creates an irony in itself thats just‚Ä¶speechless and funny to anyone that can see the redundancy._ Is it possible to be extremely social and still be autistic_ I noticed that too! Why didn't the crowd think that was funny? He even gave them an extra second to laugh... double empthy problem?_ I smiled, too._ Idk if i autistic but i got the joke and i think that it was sad actually_ @emmaoelius¬† laughed cos it‚Äôs relatable_ @sirgalah561¬†I was mad it was a good joke and Dey didn‚Äôt laff_ That's was a joke_ Neurodiversity._ Me too I have so much empathy and compassion because I cry üò≠ when I watch Darr Mann videos because they are so emotional üò≠ to watch._ I really also really love watching the good doctor because there‚Äôs a person that also have autism and it‚Äôs also making me cry üòø so hard because of how emotional üò≠ and with happy tears ü§£._ It means problem_ You guys are funny_ What a brave young man! He is giving a voice to all the heroes on the spectrum. So much more compassion from those who have autism than the people who consider themselves ordinary . Let these angels lead our country, we would have so much more._ The way humans have gone politically nuts these days, I have to say I enjoy my two autistic sons that much more! They aren‚Äôt sold out to political ideology and they have the ability to reason and care._ He's so cute üòä_ He is absolutely right._ 1 in 36 people born now will develop ASD, that ratio is headed towards 1 in 3 by the end of this decade. we are going through a glyphosate epidemic people. Speak up now or suffer the consequences of the silent._ Thank you! \n\nCongratulations on a great presentation. \n\nWhat you said about feeling forced in certain situations to mask your coping mechanisms broke my heart for you. \n\nI hope the world comes to a better understanding soon, including the gifts, as well as the challenges‚Ä¶ so you don‚Äôt feel so obligated to play by our rules. \n\nThe analogy you made about PlayStation and X-Box was perfect. It really helped your idea click for me. \n\nI have a secret for you that you probably already know. \n\nMost folks I know - no matter what their particular challenge might be - feels the need or desire or pressure to mask at times who they really are inside for fear of being ostracized or worse. \n\nI hope the world gets more comfortable for everybody and stays authentic, less ‚Äúparty face‚Äù. \n\nI have a toddler son who will be tested soon. He is so sensitive and gets upset and cries if any other kid is crying until he sees us check on them and make sure they‚Äôre alright. We call him ‚Äúthe Sheepdog Brother‚Äù.\n\n It really helped me understand him when you talked about the extremes of emotion that you feel underneath because I can see that in him. \n\nA few nephews and a niece have been diagnosed and are a bit older and I‚Äôm so grateful they‚Äôre in our family because seeing how their families function give us some examples and some insight and preparation. \n\nI‚Äôd hate for them to be made to feel less than human. \n\nThanks so much for sharing your perspective. Very brave.\n\n And very handsome hair indeed. \n\nCheers to your success! May it prove to be one of many in the trajectory of a long, healthy life for you._ Thank you so much for sharing! You're video made me understand my son so much better ‚ù§Ô∏è_ A lovely speech from a lovely person._ How long did it take for you to start talking so much my son is autistic he is now 8 he likes to play with me but he can communicate so little he can tell me he is hungry and I ask him what he wants to eat and its always a repeat of what I said and tabita or tabani he is half Japanese so most of if not all his words are in Japanese I hope to see a day to have some what normal conversation I love the moments he looks at me and asks to be tickle but its so few 90% of his time is playing alone and laughing in his world._ I know people that are autstic and wearing diapers_ Grown up in Asia, the western social gathering events that are full of alcohol, small talks and extremely loud music and drunk ppl don‚Äôt make any sense to me, then I was told that is just the cultural differences._ As an aspie myself I am very proud of this guy for making a stand, telling Norms about us and educating and raising points that need to be heard! You did amazing up there, be proud of yourself ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è_ Creepy_ It's nice to hear this message being spread, and all power to him for doing so, cuz it cannot be an easy thing to do.\n\nThat being said, being someone who lives this experience day in and day out, this talk doesnt feel like it was directed to people like me (which, for the record, is fine) as all of this basically comes like common knowledge to me, though I am painfully aware of the fact it is not for most ppl._ This is really touching_ I hate Dhar Mann. His videos are so unrealistic._ @rmn070¬† because they are actors_ @NicolasCereghino30¬† I know._ @rmn070¬† at least Darr Mann is not like this fakestation Jaystation ImJayStation 666 Dream Team and Station Studios has a poor reputation to YouTube._ @NicolasCereghino30¬† I‚Äôve never watched them, so I wouldn‚Äôt know. I did hear that Jaystation got arrested. Dhar Mann isn‚Äôt that bad enough to get arrested, that‚Äôs just silly._ @rmn070¬† jaystation makes videos like \"I ORDERED A HUMAN FROM THE DARK WEB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (GONE WRONG OMG) (NOT CLICKBAIT)_ What's your point exactly?_ I know people without autism that are wearing diapers_ hi um, could you not use the term \"Asperger's\"? it's really harmful and you can do a research for why. sorry I can't really write normally rn i want to sleep and am not a native speaker, hope u understand/nm_ @crit_dmg¬† Why is it harmful? I can‚Äôt find any reason, it‚Äôs just a name of a condition that many including myself live with._ @crit_dmg¬† You would get your point across much more effectively if you told us why you feel the term Asperger's is so harmful instead of expecting us to research it based solely on your stated opinion. I find the term to be a helpful shortcut for identifying a set of traits or tendencies in a way that many (or perhaps most) people are familiar with. Sure, shortcuts usually have problems of their own, but I'm curious why you feel this one is so damaging. I'm also curious about specifically what damage you feel it causes. Sure, I can do my own research but because all of our lives are so busy these days, I'm not likely to unless I have a reason or motivator to._ ?_ I am autistic, so SOME people could learn from this. It is not a disease, never has been. We are not normal sure but we are something that is capable of so much more._ How much of autism involves a definable favoring of individuality over the collective?  I'm thought to be a high-functioning autistic person, myself, but I know exactly why I am the way I am, which was brought about by my having been severed from the outside world.  I know better, in the process, to not be concerned about the majority of collectivists.  There is self-protection and group-protection, and the two cant possibly work together in lockstep, so a majority will side with the collective, while a minority will side with individualism.  That's also what explains what's going on today:  in history, there are naturally times when there is an individualistic backlash against the collective, as in the 60s and 70s.  Like then, there will be a new equilibrium and the radicals will be re-absorbed into the new equilibrium. And so it goes._ Seriously, props for not slamming your hands over your ears and falling off the stage like I would have done. That audience caused me physical pain._ Incredible presentation_ All nine of those traits are kinda true though_ Sweet guyüòç‚ù§Ô∏è_ im have autism. i have zero empathy. also i dont like talking or some foods._ I have autism and the i would say: Autism is a form of being different.\nAnd everyone is different in his own way._ I cant believe kevin parker giving speech about autism in the ted talk_ My son is autistic. I try to be a good father._ I‚Äôm relieved to find a video like this. I myself have autism, so seeing this man explain is somewhat satisfying_ Media: Autistic people don't understand humor.\nThis guy: *Jokes*_ I definitely relate to this. It's hard to remember that being autistic is not a bad thing when it's been beaten into your mind that you have to be normal to be considered successful and not a burden to society. I'm glad this guy isn't letting neurotypical people bring him down and acting like being neurodiverse is a bad thing. I respect people who don't want to have autism (because I feel that way too a lot) and we're not a monolith._ yes so relatable I hate parties because of loud noises because I also have autism and when I stim I use my fingers to calm myself!\nFinally someone is isn‚Äôt an idiot and saying ‚Äúyou have to show yourself‚Äù or ‚Äúwhy are you not crying to this sad movie?‚Äù Because I can‚Äôt show my emotions and literally can‚Äôt explain it to them because I can‚Äôt process what I‚Äôm saying makes sense. It‚Äôs really troubling for me as a 13 year old to tell them to realize I have autism even they know I have autism but they still treat me like a normal person and tell me things that are hard for me._ This was great!!! Thank you_ Fake disease. Stop being sensitive lmao_ autism is diseases. dont distort scientific part_ Bravo ‚ù§Ô∏è thank you - yes, spectrum of human being, not a disorder. I wish everyone would have so much empathy, kindness, & gentle attitude like you_ I stopped masking in my 20s as it was maki g me ill, 52 and still go Woo woo in public too._ Elon Musk is autistic;   Is he diseased?  Heck no!_ Then again, normal is a subjective term._ What's your point exactly?_ @filipeflower¬† two-fold:  first, the simple parallel of at least some autistic behavior with that of individualists, and second, if these people can find work through corresponding organizations, I had to wonder if i could do the same, since i dont have any use for anything but work on the job.  I was actually called on the carpet for working on the job at the Superdome.  Since that meant that they couldn't yet be trusted as employers, I quit, and wonder to this day where to find work in a world that exaggerates the value of talk.  Talk is BASED on work--not the other way around, after all._ @billbrenne5475¬† For Your Information, I happen to be autistic myself and I have work. Are you somehow implying that it's impossible for Autistic people to find work?_ @filipeflower¬† exactly the opposite.  I dont understand how you drew that conclusion(?)._ @billbrenne5475¬† Oh...my mistake. Sorry._ @filipeflower¬† That's alright.  I stopped and thought about your responses, and realized how you could take it that way.  My only point was that I seem to be cut off from keeping jobs unless they require little or no supervision, and otherwise, talk seems to rule the day in much of the job world, and the fact is that work and action come before talk, because talk has to have a foundation.  But in a world full of people, the cart is apparently often put before the horse.  It's been suggested to me more than once that I'm a high-functioning autistic person (Asperger's), but it wasnt until lately that I started seeing parallels between at least some autistic behavior and the behavior I'm coming to see must characterize much truly individualistic behavior, and I reasoned to myself that if there are job resources available for autistic people, then maybe those same sources would apply to me.  But I then started thinking that if I, myself, on my own couldn't take it as a given that I could get and keep jobs because I dont play the game, then how could or would any organization do any better?  The irony is that I'm in a better position than many are, I think, to point people back to the ground beneath their feet, even though that would likely fall on deaf ears. \n       So you see, I didnt really have a thought in my head about the capabilities of autistic people, per se, so much as my focus was on trying to find my way out of an apparent dilemma in the job world myself._ Autism isn't really a disease._ @strbor2506¬† Thanks for the back up._ tell that to the multiple doctors who diagnosed me then lmao_ There's already evidence that Autism isn't a disease. The NHS website should be a good start for your research._ @strbor2506¬† Not according to the NHS website._ the \"D\" in ASD stands for disorder.

Thank you for these words Ethan!  -Mylene (parent of two humans living with autism)_ As an autistic person myself, I can think of one advice (for now)...never discriminate people just because they're autistic. Never._ You may want to do a little more research into what the autistic community thinks of the labels of high-functioning and low-functioning._ @mpl8680¬† No disrespect, but how would you identify the autistic who is independent in communication and daily living, as opposed to the autistic who has no functional communication, smashes his head into walls, bites people, and consumes his own feces?  Both of those examples are autistic people_ @pardonmyfrench4760¬† I am not a psycologist, nor am I diagnosed with autism. I am saying they should do research into how autistic people people prefer to label themselves. From what I have read (which is limited), it is shown as a wheel with different symptoms in different sections, but as I said I am not an expert, and it is better to do research than listen to me._ @pardonmyfrench4760¬† personally i would be considered \"high functioning\" (though I don't like that label) but when I was younger I would dmsh My head into walls of vite myself,then I learned to mask and only vite My nails for eg or go to the bathtoom and cry when everything became too much_ @alicia1636¬† I think there are plenty of different ways to deal with stress.  When I was about 10 years old, I would get super pissed and punch walls (that behavior was quickly punished naturally haha).  But when I look back, not only was that not a good way to deal with things when upset, but it put my health at risk (I'm sure I fractured my hand at some point).\n\nWe all have different coping mechanisms, but if said coping mechanisms put the individual or other's health at risk, then it might be time for some kind of replacement/intervention/counseling._ @pardonmyfrench4760¬† true!

These kinds of views are harmful for those that are  suffering deeply everyday. \nHe‚Äôs right about the media only showing certain  \nKinds of autism, most people have never  seen severely autistic people/kids, they‚Äôve only seen high functioning autistic people that are pleasing on the eye, severely autistic people will always be children,   they‚Äôll never be able to look after  themselves and  will always wear nappies , don‚Äôt let your virtue signalling get in the way of potentially helping those that are actually suffering.

But its not true, because by having a \"mental disease\" it wont be considered normal and they would see you differently, which hurts a lot when other need to mask so they appear \"normal\".

How is finally having answers to a life of misunderstanding a handicap? You acknowledge you're not qualified to have an opinion yet somehow still decided to press enter and broadcast stupidity.

I instead of just doing a test,¬† read more about it and found more similarities, but part of me feels like I am just trying to find an excuse for being the way I am and not changing, and I am scared. I don't know completely how one can be diagnosed, I don't wanna go to a psychologist and try to \"prove\" that I am one and be told I am not because that is just going to leave me more confused that I am now. I partially don't think I am autistic and my anxiety could be seen as normal since I am in a different country where the people around me don't speak my language and it is harder to maintain the routine I had before. I just don't know what to do. don't even know why this is important to be honest but it would bring me some clarity. what do you think I should do, how should I approach this problem? I have been feeling a lot of guilt for being the way that I am._ @goncalomoura7628¬†\nFirst of all don't view yourself as a problem, it's lead so many to self-hatred.\nThe only benefit from an official diagnosis is you will become entitled to support services, if you've already got enough support a diagnosis won't make a difference.\n\nIf you are autistic higher levels of anxiety and feeling disturbed when a routine is disrupted is common. In the autistic brain it's been seen there's overactivation in what's called the \"amygdala\" where the fight or flight function is.\nAutistic brains are systemizers and function in a systematic manner, if both the income and outcome are known it doesn't cause as much anxiety.\n\nIf you join an online autism community so you can talk to other autistic people, if you find it easier to understand autistic people than nonautistic people it's another sign you could be autistic.\nIf you look up and read about the \"double empathy problem\" you could come to a better understanding.\n\nResearch indicates the problem with communication and interaction is grounded in the social expectations of nonautistic people who don't try to understand the other.\nYou're not the burden, society's lack of empathy for autistic people is the burden._ @danielmoore4024¬† Thank you for recommending reading about \"double empathy problem\" it was a very insightful read. I am going to try to follow your advice and see where that leads me. also in another comment on this video you said \"how The problem is society's rejection of diversity\" and after reading about the characteristics that can make up an autistic person I can see how the world is not built around with those people in mind, something that hopefully will change in the future. if I come to the conclusion I am not autistic at least this was really eye opening, destroyed the previous ideas I had about autism and made me more aware to the problems people can face on a daily basis. Thank you again for responding._ I have not been diagnosed, but I have too many traits to not be autistic.

If you are autistic you'll find it easier to communicate with other autistic people, it's called the \"double empathy problem\".\nNonautistic people struggle to communicate with autistic people, it all goes in both directions.\n\nThe truth actually is we don't know what autism is yet, what we do know is humanity will not survive without us._ You are an amazing woman!_ hiiii, we don't love the terms \"high\" and \"low\" functioning, we prefer high support needs and low support needs. :))_ Neurotypical people don't find routine breaks as stressful as Autistic people do. \nGetting a diagnosis would not be a good excuse; there are no cures for autism(the reactions to which you consider a personal failing to improve). But there are mitigation techniques; if you imagine you are autistic, try the mitigation things, and they help, then congrats, no need to worry if you are or not. \nSo in conclusion, it doesn't matter if you're subconsciously using autism as an excuse(which I severely doubt you are), because all you would be doing is mitigation and management techniques. \n\nAlso, people with autism have difficulties labelling emotions(not the best phrasing)- so your difficulty in figuring out if your faking or not would be an example of that function. \n\nEither way, look for stuff that resonates with you among autistic people, and if it helps it helps!

Cures for deafness exist (albeit not perfect ones). Yet, in deaf culture, deafness is celebrated. Still, some people choose to get a cochlear implant or even just a hearing aid. It‚Äôs a choice. The cure can exist, but we can also celebrate people who choose to embrace their deafness. Can‚Äôt autism be this way, too?_ I find having high functioning Autism to be a burden._ We live in a time when all effort is being pushed for comfort and ease. We are addicted to convenience and raising children has been oversimplified to be known as an inconvenience many do not want to put the effort into. So imagine having a child  with Autism, which takes effort, the same as raising any child, but also gives one opportunities to learn new ways of thinking and doing things which will effect the quality of life ones child has? THAT is why people are trying to ‚Äúcure‚Äù Autism. It‚Äôs inconvenient. And what‚Äôs actually being done, is eugenicists are trying to find markers in the womb to determine if an unborn child may have autism so they can be aborted for the sake of the child, but not actually for the child at all if we‚Äôre being honest. Read NeuroTribes and learn the truth about Autism._ Love how the guy states all the misconceptions of autism at the beginning and states how this is not true because 'I am autistic', after basically describing himself in single word terms._ Autism is more than that, actually. Start doing your research about it._ @filipeflower¬† You seem a little defensive about it. I never said it wasn't more than that. I'm just acknowledging what should be logically apparent. Disability checks go to people with disabilities._ @jeremiahnoar7504¬† I suggest you do your research more accurately about Autism._ @filipeflower¬† What do you think I'll find?_ @jeremiahnoar7504¬† What I know you'll find (as long as you actually try it) is useful information about Autism._ @filipeflower¬† what kind of useful information? anything relevant to my post above in any way?

Well as you may or may not know, the Autism spectrum is a very large Multi faceted and sometimes complicated subject.  if you want me to research something then you‚Äôre going to have to be more specific._ @jeremiahnoar7504¬† Does the NHS UK website mean anything to you? (that's one example among many)_ Your confusing legal context with neurological context._ @tricksterjoy9740¬† actually I'm noting the contradiction between the legal and neurological definition. In this particular case, I don't see why we've  defined the two terms separately._ @jeremiahnoar7504¬† Imagine someone has a condition where at random points of time and for random periods of time, they can‚Äôt use their legs. Would you consider them disabled, or would you consider their condition disabling?\n\nFor someone with autism, the level of difficulty in life fluctuates drastically depending on many many factors, and is generally completely different for each person. \n\nContext and understanding of autism is required before you start calling it a disability or not a disability. It‚Äôs more complicated then that, as much as we all wish it wasn‚Äôt._ @jeremiahnoar7504¬† the point is, technically autism isn‚Äôt a disability, as what hinders them is largely external. It can be disabling in many cases. They are completely different, but there are similarities to CPTSD, as CPTSD on its own isn‚Äôt a disability, but it‚Äôs symptoms CAN be. \nSocietal navigation of made up social rules and etiquette, the constant lying EVERYONE does, and much more are what are the issue. \n\nPlease do look into what the experience of autism is like, ideally from people who actually experience it like myself and are better at explaining things._ Maybe it's a bit inconvenient that he said \"We don't think of it as a disease\" because some people will say it's just his way of coping with the diagnosis. I actually learned that science itself says it's not a disease. It's a different neurological way of functioning, that is not curable BECAUSE it's not a disease. Just adding that. He's amazing for holding this speech_ Yes me2_ Has your family ever looked into giving him letters of the alphabet so he can point to them? I can guarantee he most likely has thoughts and feelings just can‚Äôt speak them out physically but maybe showing him the letters will help him get his thoughts out <3_ I very much agree.  I am not an extreme case but I am on the spectrum.  Now that I am older and more experienced, I know society expects certain things.  If someone tells me that a loved one died, I know that I should respond that I am very sorry for them and that it is a sad time.  I might not truly think that, I might think its great that the person died, since they had cancer and were suffering for example.  So I know what society expects and I can deal with that.\nIt is when I am on my own I am most effected.  When I eat the same foods every single day.  When I must go to the gym for 1 and a half hours every day.  When I must use the toilet in my own home.  When I avoid participating in an event because I will not be able to follow my daily routine.  \nI would love to be spontaneous, try new things, take a day off from myself, but I cannot.  This all has zero to do with outside influence.  In fact those outside influences are usually very encouraging._ I used to believe this and I don‚Äôt anymore, personally I wouldn‚Äôt want a cure because I‚Äôve come to understand my brain much better, things I thought I was struggling with totally unrelated to society, turned out they were related to society just in a way that was hard to figure out, and this mostly happened when I joined communities full of people like me and it helped me to realize a lot of the things that bother me so much are so normal in that context, they really don‚Äôt bother me anymore, I was able to accept myself fully because of that community and I was rather surprised to realize I just didn‚Äôt care about those things anymore, I really thought it was totally unrelated to society, just objectively sucked, but I didn‚Äôt realize the whole time that even alone in my room I was trying to make myself ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and ‚Äúfailing‚Äù at that was what actually bothered me, your opinion is obviously valid but I just wanted to share my perspective because I have a lot more peace with myself and my struggles now, those communities made me feel normal, and I really don‚Äôt know how to explain how deeply that changed me, I really wish that for everyone_ Weed is the cure. I don't believe in a vaccine for autism or any sort of other cure._ Don't count on it. There is no cure for Autism._ @filipeflower¬† I'm on the spectrum, but I understand other people's reasoning for not wanting to have it. We're not a monolith. Some days I wish I could be neurotypical too because of my confidence issues._ @itsannieharrison¬† That can be worked on._ You have no idea how insulting that comment is for people like me._ @jamieholmes6087¬† lol says the one insulting those wanting a cure_ @idontcare2851¬† Prove it._ @bullrun2772¬† I didn't see Jamie Holmes insulting people. Besides, autism isn't a disease and can't be cured. That has already been proven._ @idontcare2851¬† And that proves your claim how exactly?_ @idontcare2851¬† And by the way, you don't have to insult me (by calling me \"dipstick\") just because I don't agree._ @idontcare2851¬† How exactly am I \"dangerous\"? Just because I don't agree with your claims? If that's what you consider \"dangerous\", then you're the one who needs to leave the internet, not me.\nBy the way, Ad Hominem attacks only reveal the weakness of the attacker (that's you)._ @idontcare2851¬† For Your Information, I've already spoken to multiple Doctors (that are actually qualified for this) and none of them accused me of being \"diseased\" just because I'm autistic. As for dictionaries, you're going to have to be more specific than that. Not all dictionaries are the same. And for further information, there's a certain activist (called Sara Rocha) who already proved that Autism itself isn't really a disease as some people were led to believe, but a neurogolical diversity. That's why all attempts at trying to \"cure\" Autism failed. I suggest you read her articles. Sara Rocha works in the health department and she happens to be Autistic herself.

I think autistic individual's are exceptionally special and gifted. God Bless you Brother!_ I like twains_ As a person with HFA, I agree with most of what this fella said. Huge amount of respect for him. However, even as an autistic person, I have to disagree with the notion that it‚Äôs not a disorder. Here‚Äôs the problem with that theory:  if it were simply an alternate way of thinking and processing emotions and thoughts, it would have to be something that‚Äôs learned over time, or even chosen. Like when a person chooses a religion or philosophical ideology. However, autism wasn‚Äôt something I chose, or even picked up over time; I was born with it. In addition, I‚Äôve struggled in school my whole life, haven‚Äôt been able to get or keep good jobs, and most depressingly, haven‚Äôt been able to build or maintain romantic relationships.  That being said, I see no reason to view it as anything other than a disorder. \n     I would certainly agree that the massage of autism awareness needs to be spread, as I believe we are probably the most commonly discriminated minority, but I truly believe that not calling it what it is, a developmental disorder, is harmful to those who have it. I know this as I have suffered at the hands of doctors and therapists that told me I was ‚Äúnormal‚Äù, I just process things differently. With all this said, here‚Äôs what I believe:  Autism is, without a doubt, a developmental disorder, however, it can‚Äôt, nor does it need to be cured. Through proper therapy, and learning of social skills it can be treated and worked through. And through people like this, the world can be made aware that we‚Äôre people too; we have feelings, desires, and we matter just as much as anyone else!\n     God bless!_ You are NOT AUTISTIC ....you are....AN INDIGO_ thank you_ l so admire his courage and abiIity to speak up in pubIic! NormaIIy, peopIe with autism are too shy to do that!_ One of my best friends has Autism.  She is one of the sweetest, funniest, and brilliant people that I know! People haven't always been kind to her. There is name calling and someone cussed at her for being interested in his pencil. She has her struggles, but she is just perfect the way she is! It's great to hear someone say it like it is, people with autism are human beings just like us. Just because the perceive the world differently doesn't give anyone an excuse to bully, shame, and make fun of!! \"I am human and I am not diseased\"! Amen brother!!‚ù§‚ù§_ You are amazing, You are brilliant, and very brave, & have nice hair. I am not Autistic, but am in contact with someone who is waiting for Diagnosis of it.

Not a criticism btw._ I want to start an autism group that puts all bullies put on death row_ What's worst is a non autistic person without empathy than an autistic person not able to express.._ I am autistic, and I am ashamed of being autistic. I hate myself. because being autistic is being alone in this world. That nobody understands you. That even your family do not understand and most reject you and mentally abuses you because you cannot do the same things everybody else can.\nBeing autistic is being the victim and center of prejudice, mockery, bullying.\nTo suffer every day of your life without nobody lending a hand, to nobody to save you when you feel like drowning.\nAnd no body to love.\nAnd I hate it. I hate it with all my heart. I am an old man, who is literaly in the streets. Because nobody gives you a job. And when you get one, you cannot sustain it as it gets overhauling. \nFor four decades I've been trying...\nAnd I can no more._ very well said wtk_ The NHS UK website defies your comment._ What‚Äôs that_ what?_ You‚Äôre really kind , thanks for giving us hope in the world_ Coran?

It is not an obsession when you go through it every single day._ @solitaregames¬† And? That doesn't change the fact that other people (specially strangers) have nothing to do with your personal life._ @filipeflower¬† do you have any idea what mental abuse and physical abuse is?\nBecause it seems not._ @solitaregames¬† I don't recall you mentioning that before. But even so, quitting your identidy because of what others think of you isn't the solution. I've been through a similar situation and I'm still here._ @solitaregames¬† Therapists and advice or support from other people will never work unless you truly want to start loving yourself. Start out by actually taking care of yourself and have fun in life. Life isn't about having a job and getting money or being normal, it's about having fun and loving yourself so stop with the self pity and go out and actually make a change yourself instead of relying on other people to change you, because that's never going to work. I hope you actually take my advice and I wish you good luck._ @kr0ll3x¬† My point exactly. üëçüèª_ I have both asthma and autism how am I still alive_ He have that Elon Musk vibe..

I'd like it if my mind could be read, because i can never get out my true thoughts or intentions._ 5:00 they don‚Äôt know how to see autism then_ If we see it that way, then we cant blame anything like let's say...vaccines...vitamin k shots, etc...not to make anyone feel negatively and not for me to be perceived negatively. I'm just trying to cope with these recent diagnoses and understand everything while I have a strong suspicion..._ What about those with Autism who have bad behavior issues? Those in the spectrum that have these fucking meltdowns!\n\nMy kid has autism, he's a teen. And he's meltdowns are really bad.

It's very difficult.\n\nI need help with my son and it's so difficult to get help_ \"My inner mind is unlimited\". That's how it feels to be autistic._ God bless you dear_ When i hear autism i immediately think of Chris Chan. However his life was pretty much ruined from his early childhood. Born to old parents of the old generation where ppl who were socially different were locked up in asylums and lobotomized so they never got him any help. \nHis parents basically locked him away and pampered him with toys to keep him quiet and never got him the help that he needed.\nAnd the trolling he suffered from it as an adult is legendary online.\n\nThere is so much to him that it's impossible to write. But there are  documentaries about him on YouTube if you're interested.\n\nPeace ‚úåÔ∏è_ Is Autism something we should prevent if we‚Äôre able to? Not cure but prevention? Let‚Äôs help each other understand instead of getting angry at differing opinions_ So far this has helped me tremendously in understanding Autism.  My son is Autistic and is now 17 years old and I was unsure of a lot because I don't have contact with him due to a bad ending of a relationship with his father.  It hurts not knowing what type of emotional distress this has put my son through to which I have been separated from him since the age of about 7 yrs. Old.  Thanks for the knowledge and being so courageous to share your story._ Great job!  You are one of the amazing advocates for many who need clarification and need to do less apologizing for who they are.

I don't wish to change him, but to ease his life.. great presentation._ Excellent & informative._ I find it infuriating that I can no longer use the term 'stimming'. It bloody well works. I work with autistic adults and when they 'stim' they regulate fast and return to baseline under the Cornell University idea. But you can't say 'stimming' or 'regulating' or 'meltdown'. Political correctness has stifled staff who want to provide support. It's all about this 'want to get a coffee', 'want to tell us about your day' philosophy, rather than being person centred. We are trained to train them. Not trained to let them be who they are. I say to a resident \"what have you done today\". I should be saying, \"what would you like to do right now\". But healthcare systems don't allow this._ I am so proud of you as I am for my autistic son,you are the best teachers we could ever have and a proof of the most pure hearts that still exsict,last year I saw thi ga in me and start making me think that I may be also autistic and I was very very surprised when you mentioned your mom, tears came into  my eyes...

In coming years a lot of people will be born autistic. Highly creative, highly intelligent but socially awkward to how society is now. However, a person who is autistic is more likely to want to do good in the world than to be the next Hitler._ My exact sentiments - I needed this so much!!!  my daughter is ten diagnosed at 18 months ... and she‚Äôs amazing.

Because I was taught that if you have nothing nice to say; then say nothing at all._ The problem is not Autism, Down Syndrome, ADHD etc.\nThe problem is society's rejection of diversity, society's fear of what they don't understand._ I get overwhelmed by noises of people eating or drinking and mankind noise....

However, to show empathy, you have to mirror the other person's emotions, which people with autism might not know how to do._ After people clapped his voice was a little shaky. You can tell it was very hard for him to do this._ Don't mean to be harsh but autists don't cry until a Disney movie comes on._ That subject is much much more complicated than that._ @ZTRCTGuy¬† \nNo it's not, you're intruders who intrude our lives with your delusional one size fits all belief._ @danielmoore4024¬† Making an emotional argument instead of a rational one will not help any discussion. Society's reaction on any kind of diversity being good or bad, or what even defines good or bad are objectively complicated subjects.  \n\nIntruders... gtfo._ Most of society can't understand why a person would  not be enthusiatic at talking nonsensical drivel, such as pointing out the weather or gossiping about people in their town.  They can not understand why someone may want to share and converse openly of their passions and interests_ @ZTRCTGuy¬† his comment was as rational as it gets, what are you talking about? That is exactly what is happening, and it's an innate biological response_ Eh. There‚Äôs still a problem with diseases. I have autism, it‚Äôs a disease. I deal with it every waking moment of my life._ @idontcare2851¬† \nNeurodevelopmental conditions are not diseases, it's natural neurodevelopment.\nDiseases involve abnormalities, there is no such thing as a \"normal\" neurodevelopment meaning there's no such thing as \"abnormal\" neurodevelopment. \nThe term \"normal\" was not even being used until the 1840s and these conditions have existed throughout evolution.\n\nI'll give you an opportunity to prove to me it's a disease, answer the following question to prove your claim;\nWhat scientific evidence brought mankind to the conclusion there's only one correct way to neurodevelop?_ anc¬† just because someone's a minority doesn't automatically mean they're good people. and them being a part of that minority doesn't make them a mouthpiece of the issues faced by the said group as a whole; because personal experiences differ and it's a vital part of building character. i say this because even though i personally don't think you are either of the things you mentioned, just another internet anon hiding their prejudice behind false qualifiers, i wouldn't be surprised in the slightest if you are indeed a bigoted gay individual on the spectrum._ George Fentanyl¬† \nI've never seen Autism as any kind of sickness or disease, when younger I asked what's a disability, they're answer of disadvantages and limitations fits all humans, only the needs of autistic people are less common, and that most of the suffering was not because of autism but by how people reacted to it.\n\nI could sense something positive about my autism as well as unusual difficulties, strengths as well as difficulties and disabilities don't give strengths, so I didn't see autism as equivalent to disability. \n\nConcerning things like some being unverbal, I think it's possible they prefer unverbal communication. Just because I see being unverbal not the best position doesn't mean they don't, people claim my life must be devastating but it's not, I think their lives are as they would say devastating but they claim it's not. It makes me think people judge the life of others by comparing them to their own life.\n\nI've always believed that some differences can be used as advantages if the person can self-accept. If we temporarily think of schizophrenia, believing unreal things, we describe so many things as \"unreal\", I imagine many great inventions were by people with schizophrenia because they believed unreal ideas as possible that they still pursued it while people without would not because they saw it as impossible. \n\nThis is why I support The Neurodiversity Movement, first the reasoning to call them disabilities is no more valid than saying there's only one correct gender, race, culture etc. \nAnd second, these neurodevelopmental conditions give advantages.\nAnd third, according to scientific knowledge the only genes that survive are genes a species requires, if that's correct these conditions are supposed to exist._ Thats true_ @You are correct But \nFirst of all, the majority of what you call \"autism deficits\" are no different to \"human deficits\", like stimming, nonautistic people stim. Basically people have just described all the behaviour of autistic people with negativity when it's no different to the behaviour of others who are not autistic, and this is where the idea we're all autistic comes from. People see themselves performing human behaviours labelled \"autism traits\" and assume they're a little autistic when they're not, because the majority of deficits are no different to the majority.\n\nThose utterly dependent on others for their most basic needs is not because of autism itself, but because of how selfish and mindless the society is concerning their needs. How can I as someone who's not a paediatrician successfully help parents help their children overcome their struggles while the paediatricians failed them? Because I know the the true cause, how insensitive and thoughtless the society is. \n\nSo much behaviour of autistic people is not bad at all, it's just different and difference is not a bad thing, it's differences that make this world a great place.\n\nI take parents out of the traditional medical route to a route that involves treating the person as an actual human, and not a broken child. \n\nThose who are unverbal, there's nothing bad about being unverbal, it's just a difference, the fact I can still successfully teach parents how to communicate with unverbal children reveals it's the society's problem. \n\nIt's plain obvious that the society hates differences and all hatred arises from fear, as so many good differences you describe as deficits you do so because the society  hates differences._ @You are correct But \nNo, people don't display traits to a varying extent, they display human traits, people are either autistic or not, there is no \"I'm a bit autistic\", someone is either entirely autistic or not autistic at all, people cannot be both on and off of The Autism Spectrum, you're either on or off, autistic or not autistic. Neurotypical people use metaphors, I sometimes use metaphors, does that mean I'm a bit neurotypical?\n\nThey have the inability to feed themselves etc. because you never teach them, the very kind your speaking of I've spoken with parents with those children and as soon as they followed my counseling within a couple of weeks they were feeding themselves, the parents find it unthinkable. \n\nNeurotypical people struggle to communicate and interact with autistic people, it's all been tested and neurotypical people are even worse at reading autistic people than autistic people, it's a two directional problem.\n\nWhich level is neurotypical and what is your scientific formula to determine what measure it crosses from neurotypical to not neurotypical?\n\nI can say you've got deficits because your brain functions far below the level of autistic people, you have a great lack of attention, a great lack of thinking, a great lack of mindfulness, lack of detail, a great lack of concentration. The lack of social intuition is compensated by attention, thinking, concentration, detail orientation and mindfulness no matter where on the spectrum they are. \n\nIf you're going to refer to the human genome first know it contains no more than 21,000 genes the size of a worm, the scientists knew all along, anyone can be pathologised including you. \n\nNotice I said society, if you had compassion you would actually listen to the autistic community and accept our advice as the parents I privately counsel with to get their kids functioning, we wouldn't have the bullying, mockery, suicide, masking, employment discrimination._ Syd Barger¬† \nDefine the symptoms of \"normal people\". \n\nSaying there's only one correct way to neurodevelop is no more valid than saying there's only one correct gender, race or culture._ Or it's just that you spend your whole day watching my little pony and have no self awareness of it._ @platosocrates9350¬† \nI don't even know what your little pony has to do with this, NTs do tend to speak pointless rubbish._ @danielmoore4024¬† What do you mean when you call not pooping in front of people at the park because you know basic social norms, \"speaking pointless rubbish?\"_ @platosocrates9350¬† \nA lot of your \"social norms\" are absolutely disgusting, while neurotypical people just fall in the pit so unconsciously autistic people are able to self-reflect and not sacrifice their values for disgusting behaviour.\n\nYour social norms involve bullying, profanity, foul mouths, insensitivity, pornographics, violation, stealing, flirting, curb crawling, during the last decade you've developed a worldwide sexual obsession. Sexual obsession is what your social norms are full of._ @platosocrates9350¬† \nOh, do you really feel so ashamed of your low-functioning brain regions that you erased your comment? At least I'm not ashamed of my cognitive functioning.\n\nI'll say it again, Einstein pointed out \"A problem cannot be solved by the same level of consciousness that created it.\"\n\nIt shows the great lack critical, radical, creative, detail orientation, concentration, mindfulness, held back by social convention, what a great lack of brain functioning normal brains have.\n\nIt's a well known fact the majority of entrepreneurs are the most creative because of their dyslexia, how their dyslexia increases their creativity. \n\nYour \"normal\" brain that is nothing but a group of statistical artifacts is not very gifted compared to neurodivergent people is it?\n\nL. V. Beethoven (Bipolar)\nEinstein (Autism)\nJohn Nash (Schizophrenia)\nRichard Branson (Dyslexia)\nBach (ADHD)\n\nThere's just a few, how many people are so influenced by their works? \nAutistic people are not very influenced by neurotypical people because we've already left the box and gone beyond you._ anc¬† That just makes you even worse._ Syd Barger¬† \"Normal\" is a subjective term, you know._ anc¬† You don't even know where I'm from._ Syd Barger¬† What makes you think he has the mind of a child? Only because he disagrees with you? That's not maturity on your part._ Syd Barger¬† Look who's talking._ Syd Barger¬† \nYou still can't answer my question and you're deciding to talk about maturity? I'll give you a few more options.\n\n1) What scientific evidence claims there's only one correct style of cognitive functioning, what is the scientific basis?\n\n2) \"normal\" is a social construct, meaning \"abnormal\" is a social construct, why do you create \"abnormal\" if you don't like it?\n\n3) Some regions of neurodivergent brains function better than neurotypical brains, so why insult our brains but not your own low-functioning areas?\n\n4) What gives you neurotypicals authority over our lives, why must we let you perform oppression on us?\n\n5) Why must we allow you to physically harm us?\n\nDon't deny all the abuse you neurotypicals execute on the neurodivergent population through your arrogance and hypocrisy._ @danielmoore4024¬† Well spoken. üëçüèª_ Syd Barger¬† Actually, you labeled Daniel Moore with a comment of yours that says \"you have the mind of a child\". You pretty much patronized Daniel. This is just one example of evidence. You also accused me of not being much of an expert in maturity (without even knowing me to boot) and yet you still believe that you're right anyway. That just reveals ignorance (and prejudice) on your part.\nAnd third, just because you see Autism as an \"genetic abnormality\" doesn't make it true. Specially when you failed to provide evidence to back up your claims. I, on other hand, already did that. The NHS UK website is one example (among many). There's more where those came from._ Syd Barger¬† \nYou call this mature of you?\n\nYou oppress us and take authority over our lives by supporting your arrogance and the neurotypical way of doing things to us.\n\nOne part of your hypocrisy is you neurotypicals accuse autistic people as unable to accept another's perspective.\nThe reason we don't accept your perspective is the fact what's good for you is sometimes harmful to us, unfortunately you're too arrogant to acknowledge that.\n\nMore of your hypocrisy is accusing those of us autistic as people with social deficits when you have the very same difficulties yourself, you struggle to communicate and interact with us but once again, are too arrogant to acknowledge that.\n\nMore of your hypocrisy as already mentioned, claiming there's something wrong with our brains because they function less in some areas while again being too arrogant and prideful to acknowledge you have brain regions with low-functioning.\n\nYour attitude towards us is more of the oppression making us have to fight for a place in society when we shouldn't have to. Your pride and arrogance is one of our biggest problems to deal with, just because you see something as bad you assume it's bad for us and try to reshape us with things like ABA. You think an autistic person been unverbal is a bad thing, well, my nextdoor neighbor has an unverbal autistic grandson and my neighbor says his grandson likes his life. Even though he likes his life, neurotypicals like yourself want to take that from him and make him verbal.\n\nThe pride and arrogance of you neurotypicals treating and talking about us with inequality and cultural prejudice is what causes most of our suffering, so stop frowning on our decisions of how to live life thinking yours is better for us when it actually leads as far as suicide.\n\nI don't know how you neurotypicals can live with yourselves pushing autistic people to commit suicide just to make things suit your expectations, it's plain cruelty, now answer my questions._ Syd Barger¬† \nNo, I've asked you enough times, so answer mine first.\n\nYou're an intentional liar as you've written lies in your responses, so why should I believe you have any diagnosis?\n\nEven if you are autistic, that makes you an intentional liar again with deceit._ Syd Barger¬† \nCertainly not trust you as your lies like not labelling me are not accidental lies._ Syd Barger¬† \"you have the mind of a child.\" This comming from the same person who not only can't read minds, but also fails to understand what true maturity really is like. You know nothing about me, so stop acting like you do._ Syd Barger¬† Also, if you knew how Daniel Moore would reply, why couldn't you just post his comment before he posted his? Seriously, anyone can claim to know something, but to prove it is the hard part. And evidence is something you don't seem to have. Stop playing the smartass card._ @platosocrates9350¬† What's wrong with watching My Little Pony? Are you even aware that the Brony community exists?_ Syd Barger¬† How do you know? I bet you can't even guess my first real name._ @filipeflower¬† Yup, and that's the saddest thing about our generation. We have an entire subculture dedicated to unbathed basement dweller males who are obsessed with a show meant for little girls. And it's people like you who comprise that community._ @platosocrates9350¬† Correction. It used to be for little girls. But ever since 2010, that idea was changed. If you actually did your research more accurately, you would have known that fact. Keep your ignorance to yourself._ @filipeflower¬† That just proves we have an epidemic of unproductive man children who will be all homeless in another 10 years._ @platosocrates9350¬† And how does that claim of yours prove anything? Where's the evidence?_ @filipeflower¬† I don't have to provide evidence. You're the child who spends your whole day watching a cartoon for little girls in your parents' basement. 50 years ago such behavior would be considered abominable. You think the guys who flew to the moon and invented that TV you use to watch MLP spent their lives acting like you? What are you going to do when your parents can't care for your any longer?_ @platosocrates9350¬† Oh, so now you're resorting to random accusations about me (with prejudiced Ad Hominem to boot)? That only further proves my point about your ignorance. You know nothing about my personal my life, but you're acting like you do. That says a lot about your character.\n\nPS: I'll have you know that I have a job and a girlfriend._ @platosocrates9350¬† Nice edit, by the way._ @platosocrates9350¬† \n\"What would happen if the autism gene was eliminated from the gene pool? \n\nYou would have a bunch of people standing around in a cave, chatting and socializing and not getting anything done.\"_ @filipeflower¬† You probably work a part time fast food job and you never said you don't live with your parents lol. Your girlfriend is probably just your sister pretending to love you because she feels bad for you._ @platosocrates9350¬† Do you have any evidence to back up your accusation?_ @danielmoore4024¬† And what's your evidence for that? Unproven claims of Steve Jobs having your condition that's highly controversial and wasn't even known about until less than 30 years ago? Yeah, sure. ü§£_ @platosocrates9350¬† Well, to be fair, you failed to back up your claims yourself, so who exactly are you to talk? Seriously, it's obvious you're trolling for the sake of it._ @platosocrates9350¬† \nThe evidence is in front of you day after day, your obsession with socializing. \nThen we've got all the inspirational people throughout history like Einstein, Tesla, Mozart, Van Gogh and tonnes more who moved things in their interest forward would be diagnosed as autistic today._ @danielmoore4024¬† You forgot Satoshi Tajiri, the creator of Pok√©mon._ @filipeflower¬† Why would I? The fact that you even said that makes it obvious that I'm right lol. But of course, your type can't pick up on nonverbal cues lol_ @danielmoore4024¬† Not a single one of those people you mentioned had autism lol. There's no evidence except \"they were smart\" and because your mommy told you that you were smart too as a child, you took that literally and now use made up rumors about famous scientists as your defense for not contributing to society. The only one you mentioned that's actually mental was Tesla, but it's agreed he had OCD. Once again, your black and white thinking got the best of you. You think all people who are smart are autistic and that those who aren't autistic are just socially centric hoodlums. I bet you don't even know what autism actually is according to the DSM V, just what your friends on Tumblr told you ü§£_ @platosocrates9350¬† Wrong. Assuming that you're right doesn't make it true. I only mentioned a fact. You are in fact trolling. You've been making a lot of wild assumptions about my life without even trying to prove any of those to be true. You're literally the only person here who believes that bullcrap, in case you haven't noticed. If you think you're right, why don't you try to prove it?_ @UCCDQpg_pi0r2ZkWRPT8giJw I only mentioned one example. That's no reason to assume I work in a fast food restaurant as part time, no reason to assume I have a basement, no reason to assume my girlfriend is my non-existing sister, etc. Seriously, if you want people to believe any of your wild claims, at least try to prove that to be true. Prejudice is not the answer._ @filipeflower¬† You use bronies as proof that it's normal for men to watch little girl shows, and then you make completely unproven claims that several historical figures were autistic with no evidence at all, and blatantly lie that you have evidence to prove such a thing. You'd best stop arguing because you are making a complete fool of yourself! I'm saying this for your own good! You haven't a literal clue what you're talking about!_ @platosocrates9350¬† First of all, it was Daniel who said that, not me.\nSecondly, you have Google to help on your research and yet you don't seem to be using it for that purpose.\nAnd third, just because you (supposedly) met a lot of people (including Bronies) with those features, doesn't mean everyone else is the same. All your arguments so far are nothing but wild assumptions about my life. I bet you can't even guess my first real name. Seriously, you demand evidence when you're the one who needs to provide it. That only makes you a hypocrite, as a matter of fact. Not to mention your laughter emojis, which is evidence if your trolling._ @filipeflower¬† Using my neurotypical instinct I previously mentioned, I was able to INFER that you were in agreement with Daniel, who was smart enough to realize he was losing the argument with me. Once again showing your disability clearly to the world!_ @platosocrates9350¬† He could be asleep. You never know._ @platosocrates9350¬† Also, like I said before, assuming that you're right doesn't make it true. Specially when you yourself didn't show any evidence to back up your claims. You're literally the only one who believes that, in case you haven't noticed. That doesn't make you a \"winner\". It only makes you look like a self-absorbed convencido._ @platosocrates9350¬† \nWhat argument?\nYou continually making assumptions with no evidence and denying the facts is no argument, I can bet you haven't read a single piece of evidence I've linked have you?\n\nSorry about your disability, been hypocritical and dishonesty do tend to be two traits of nonautistic people._ @danielmoore4024¬† Wow, you're here already? I thought you were asleep._ @danielmoore4024¬† Lol I love how your friend alerted you of what I was saying so you could come back and try to counter me. Are you texting on discord? Or maybe that's your alt account and you're actually the same guy? But the facts are that all your claims are made up. And why are you so outraged by a guy on the internet telling you basic facts and him using his neurotypical intuition? Your embarrassing behavior today has said far more truth than your words. You are definitely a low functioning case!_ @filipeflower¬† If you were a neurotypical you'd have had enough brain cells to know that such poor timing just indicates you're using an alt account or PMing him on insta ü§£_ @platosocrates9350¬† \nStill no evidence of your claims that they were not autistic, I've given you a site just above by professionals with professionals arguing over some showing the producers are playing no bias act.\n\nSo give me evidence that those who the professionals are certain were autistic were not autistic, show me biographies that oppose the claims in the site I gave you._ @platosocrates9350¬† Actually, that doesn't prove a God damn thing. It's just another one of your wild assumptions (again). And just letting you know, I don't even have an Instagram account. Don't accuse me of things that you can't prove. I told you about this so many times..._ @danielmoore4024¬† \"Still no evidence of your refutes to all the claims I've made that I myself haven't provided any evidence for!\"\n-Daniel Moore_ @platosocrates9350¬† Are you sure you're not making that up?_ @filipeflower¬† Ah, you're trying to catch me in my own trap. Unfortunately for you I don't have a trap! I'm just stating the facts. You're an antisocial child in an adult's body who doesn't want to admit it. You sit in your parents house watching my little pony and try to justify it because you're too deep in your narcissism to even realize how low you truly are. I can't help you if you don't help yourself. Rather than try playing games with me, why not grow up? But whatever. Go your  merry way! I've warned you!_ @platosocrates9350¬† I don't see what \"trap\" you're referring to, but again, your comments don't prove anything. Now you're accusing me of being anti-social while ignoring the fact that I already have multiple friends (both in real life and also on the Internet). Next time you accuse someone of something, try providing evidence. You haven't done that.\nAlso, I haven't seen MLP since 2018. But I don't watch it on TV. I actually watched it online. And last time I checked, even adults (non-Bronies) can watch MLP (among other stuff). The fact that you're callling that a \"little girls show\" with no effort in your research simply proves your ignorance.\nAnd speaking of growing up, have you looked in the mirror lately? You've been making troll comments this entire time. And when it comes to evidence, you haven't shown anything. So what makes you think those are \"facts\"? Facts require proof. Bottom line. No proof, no truth. Simple as that._ @danielmoore4024¬† I think YouTube flags links as spam (specially if you live in an European country). Try mentioning the names of those websites instead. That can help._ @filipeflower¬† \"I haven't seen MLP since 2018\" \"I'm tough because I stubbed my toe and I only cried for 20 minutes!\"_ @danielmoore4024¬† Lol do you have any CREDIBLE sources other than some that YouTube video that once again made a baseless unproven claim based on internet speculation? Normal people can also have these issues you know. Or they could have other mental disorders. Regardless, they don't make you special._ @platosocrates9350¬† \nYou are indeed a great loser, there's no denying Temple Grandin as autistic as she has an official diagnosis of autism and is numbered among the 100 most influential people while we've got you here thinking we can't do anything.\n\nNo nonautistic person would have the combination of traits Albert Einstein had, give me a disorder besides Autism that makes people have a difficulty socializing. \n\nNo nonautistic people go as far as Cavendish including introverted people. \n\nIt's what makes a person different that makes them special, in this case, my autism is what makes me special. Since you haven't shown what makes you different I have no idea what is special about you, you just blend in with everyone else.\n\nThose of us autistic, no matter where on the spectrum have abilities nonexistent in nonautistic people because of neurodivergence. Not one nonautistic person is capable of focusing at the level autistic people focus at nor can you focus anywhere near as long as us because your brain lusts for social activity that you can't stay focused for over 12 hours without stopping to socialize.\n\nThose of us on the Autism Spectrum have detail orientation unlike nonautistic people which is why we can see the things that others can't see. Look for yourself and see there's organisations that only employ Autistic people because of our neurodivergence, what it makes us able to do that you will never be capable of._ @danielmoore4024¬† Ignoring the fact that you're still trying to weave unverified claims of Einstein's behavior into a myth that he had a developmental disability (and Nikola Tesla who you are actively disagreeing with actual educated psychologists about), Temple Grandin did nothing for the world except shut a few vegans up with her animal psychology pseudoscience. But even she did more than you. What others accomplish doesn't make you special. It just shows how insecure you are about yourself to the point that you ride off the coattails of better people. You should give up and stop your attention seeking behaviors. Nobody cares, I promise. If you were as good as them, you wouldn't care so much about this nonsense._ @airbreather9816¬† It's the right thing to do m8_ @airbreather9816¬† You're calling us \"idiots\", when Plato Socrates keeps throwing random accusations with no evidence what-so-ever while making fun of us at the same time? Are you two friends in real life? If not, why are you siding with him?_ @platosocrates9350¬†  Ok, you wrote too much stuff already. Let me separate my comment into numbered topics to make it easier for you:\n\n1- I didn't say that. Don't put words in my mouth. This is more evidence of your trolling.\n\n2- You're telling me to \"grow up\" when you're the one who keeps acting like an Internet troll over and over again? The evidence is written in your comments. You can't say you didn't do that.\n\n3- \"Normal\" is a subjective term.\n\n4- I suggest you look into other sources, such as the NHS UK website so you can see what Autism is really like. Just because you don't consider those sources credible, doesn't make it true._ @platosocrates9350¬† \nYou still can't accept what the professionals have to say, you believe neither autistic people nor professional showing you're an absolute fanatic who believes no one besides himself. You are just a jealous fanatic of the positive aspects of our autism like detail orientation, hyper-focus, thinking brains instead of social brains, mindfulness, attention and we don't fear the backlash of public opinion like you._ @airbreather9816¬† \nJust take sides with someone full of mockery, lies, denial of facts, a fanatic and call us idiots.\nI know enough about you._ @danielmoore4024¬† Either these two are somehow friends or that could be an alternative account of his._ @idontcare2851¬† it is a disease?_ @filipeflower¬† Lol the same NHS that hasn't been able to deal adequately with COVID is supposed to understand the human brain? You did say it and you know it, that's a fact. You clearly wrote it on your alt account and then agreed with it. Normal is where your brain can function. Yours cannot. Of course, it actually can, not because you are \"high functioning,\" but because the whole thing is fake anyway. You seriously expect me to believe you don't know that taking a crap in the middle of the street is weird? And then you say I'M the troll? It's clear who's trolling buddy, and us normal people can INFER that I'm talking about you._ @hllyenaylleth9576¬† yes. A disease of the brain and nervous system causing developmental delay_ @danielmoore4024¬† Oh don't give me that. The only thing your brain can hyperfocus on all day is a brick wall. Or a TV with a girly kid's show on (like my little pony). Your ability to speak does not make you intelligent. There still is no genuine proof on your side that Einstein had autism or that it contributed anything significant to society. You ought to try harder, troll._ @idontcare2851¬† what is humanity? Perfect?_ @hllyenaylleth9576¬† you are a threat to vulnerable people with a serious medical condition. I‚Äôd hate to be you._ @platosocrates9350¬† Oh, you're still here. Look, right now, I have my job to go to. We can deal with this after I'm back from work. Until then, be patient._ @filipeflower¬† Even in eastern time it's literally nearly midnight. Just admit you're a 12 year old that's been sent to bed by mommy._ @platosocrates9350¬† Actually, it's already past 6 am here in my country. Your claim doesn't prove anything. But like I said, we can talk about this later when I'm back from work. After all, my job is more important. Until then, be patient._ @filipeflower¬† Lol no. You've dedicated yourself fiercely to this debate and you even had time to respond to me. But I'll show you kindness! I'll wait until you're finished asking mommy and daddy for money to give me a response. I'm a good guy after all! Maybe you'll be like me one day when you develop self awareness!_ @idontcare2851¬† how? What are you talking about?_ @platosocrates9350¬† Okay, I'm back now. Again, I'll separate my comment into numbered topics:\n\n1- \"Yup, and that's the saddest thing about our generation. We have an entire subculture dedicated to unbathed basement dweller males who are obsessed with a show meant for little girls. And it's people like you who comprise that community\".\n\nFirst of all, you assumed that all Bronies don't bathe. That's mistake number one. You assumed that all of them live in a basement. That's mistake number 2. And you also keep assuming that My Little Pony is still just for little girls, when that statement has been proven wrongs years ago (since 2010). And that's mistake number 3. You barely started arguing and you already made 3 mistakes (based on mere assumptions with no accurate research). This is proof of your prejudice and ignorance. You also assumed they will all be homeless in about 10 years. That's mistake number 4.\n\n2- You also said this \"I don't have to provide evidence\" (1 day ago (edited)). And yet you've been demanding evidence from other users, such as Daniel Moore, for example. How hypocritical is that? Fact is, without evidence, your accusations lack credibility. Simple as that. You accused me (and Daniel) of a lot of things that you can't actually prove, such as these:\n-\"You're the child who spends your whole day watching a cartoon for little girls in your parents' basement\" (fun fact: I don't even have a basement)\n-\"You probably work a part time fast food job\" (you don't know what my job is and you said \"probably\" (twice). That alone takes away your credibility) \n-\"Your girlfriend is probably just your sister pretending to love you because she feels bad for you\" (again, assumption without evidence)\n-\"because your mommy told you that you were smart too as a child, you took that literally and now use made up rumors about famous scientists as your defense for not contributing to society\" (another assumption)\n-\"I bet you don't even know what autism actually is according to the DSM V, just what your friends on Tumblr told you ü§£\" (do you even know if Daniel has a Tumblr account? If so, what's his actual user name there?)\n-\"You are definitely a low functioning case!\" (I bet you're not an actual psychologist)\n-\"I'm tough because I stubbed my toe and I only cried for 20 minutes!\" (you're the one who said that first, not me)\n-\"You clearly wrote it on your alt account and then agreed with it.\"(what alt account? Would you please back this up?)\n\nYou see, Plato Socrates, you make a lot of accusations (and assumptions) for someone who has zero evidence to back those up. And without evidence, your claims are nothing but empty words. Simple as that. I can also accuse you of murder, but does that make it true just because I said it? Of course not. Same thing with your statements really.\n\n3- (12 hours ago) \"Even in eastern time it's literally nearly midnight. Just admit you're a 12 year old that's been sent to bed by mommy. Lol no. You've dedicated yourself fiercely to this debate and you even had time to respond to me. But I'll show you kindness! I'll wait until you're finished asking mommy and daddy for money to give me a response. I'm a good guy after all! Maybe you'll be like me one day when you develop self awareness!\"\n\nYou seem to be forgetting that I happen to be from a different country. Just because it was midnight on your side, doesn't mean it's midnight everywhere else. Do the words \"time zones\" mean anything to you? Also, you're now accusing me of being a 12 year old when you have zero clue about my real age and you yourself said I work in a part job as a fast food restaurant worker. As you can see (or maybe not), these accusations aren't compatible. This is clearly another one of your baseless accusations, but I'll say it again, evidence is required. Otherwise, you're just bullcrapping. Simple as that. And you expect me to believe you're a good guy when there's opposite evidence of that? If you think I'll end up like you, think that. With my job, my girlfriend, my friends, my family and my belongings, I don't see a reason to worry about._ @filipeflower¬† Lol as if there are bronies who do bathe, live on their own, and have a job? Where's your evidence that, in the year 2010 AD exact as you said, it was officially proven that it's normal and acceptable for men to sit in their mothers' basement all day (unbathed as usual) watching my little pony? I don't have to provide evidence because you all are the ones making the claim. You're making all sorts of absurd, unproven claims (mental illness being a superpower because famous scientists supposedly were mentally ill). Then, you try to use the new reputation of the scientists for attention and credit from others. How am I the one in the wrong exactly?_ @platosocrates9350¬† Once again, numbered topics:\n\n1- I met some of those Bronies in real life. Some of them do have jobs and lives of their own. Just because you never saw them (supposedly), doesn't mean they don't exist. Perhaps if you actually did more research (online and offline) you would have discovered that. So far, you've only shown prejudice and ignorance. And like I said, not everyone has a basement in their homes. I happen to be one of those. Try using Google or any other search engine.\n\n2- Actually, you do have to provide evidence, because you threw a lot of accusations at me (and also at Daniel) without proof. That technically counts as difamation, which (according to my country's law) is considered a crime. Anyone can accuse someone of whatever, but to prove it to be true is the hard part. And that's what you haven't done...at least, so far. That only reveals falsehood on your part.\n\n3- I don't remember saying \"mental illness being a super power\". Where did you get that from?\n\n4- Once again, you got the wrong user. It was actually Daniel Moore who said that, not me. But some research about it wouldn't hurt. I don't know about Daniel, but I can't post links directly because of YouTube's censorship (they can delete the comment if it contains a real link). Specially if you live in an European country, which happens to be my case. That's why you have to use search engines (such as Google, for example) and find the answers yourself. Don't expect others to do your work for you.\n\n5- You also failed to reply to my other statements written above.\n\nBut anyway, right now it's almost 6:30 am in my country. I'll have to prepare myself for my job (once again). You can doubt this all you want, but you can't prove this isn't true. Try doing more accurate research about cases of Autism and maybe you'll learn something. Good luck. üçÄ_ @filipeflower¬† One of the signs of schizophrenia is seeing things that aren't there. If you're really seeing functioning, well groomed bronies then I'd highly suggest you get checked for the disease. No clue how I've thrown any false accusations at you though, since everything I've said has turned out to be true. You literally said your autism makes you special and that only mentally ill people can contribute anything significant to society. If you weren't obviously using an alt account then I wouldn't be holding you accountable for what Dan says._ @platosocrates9350¬† Like I said, we can talk later after I'm back from work. Until then, be patient. Keep using Google._ @filipeflower¬† How about you become a man for the first time in your life and stop letting mommy send you to bed at such an early time in the night?_ @platosocrates9350¬† \nStill living as a prejudice fanatic I see, I feel sorry for fanatics like yourself._ @danielmoore4024¬† Lol says the fanatic who glorifies a neurodevelopmental disability..._ @filipeflower¬† I'm still waiting!_ @platosocrates9350¬† Actually, I'm the one who's been waiting. I posted that comment yesterday and only now you replied? You usually reply soon. What happened this time?_ @platosocrates9350¬† \nSays all the professionals who diagnose and observe with the DSM 5, PhD.s and neuroscientists that you're a fanatic. \n\nYou don't believe anything the professionals have to say that opposes your stereotypes, that shows you've got disadvantages as well, that you only believe yourself without evidence of your claims making you a fanatic._ @filipeflower¬† Wow imagine being that inconsiderate. I've been awake two days waiting for you to reply so I can hear your argument after you told me you'd respond when you \"get home from work.\" And in return you insult me and mock me? You need serious help._ @platosocrates9350¬† In case you haven't noticed, I already replied. You're the one who's late. The only reason you replied back is because Daniel Moore replied after my comment (which is the same comment you didn't reply to until now). Read the dates on the comment. Those don't lie.\nAnd you already insulted me and Daniel plenty of times, so who are you to talk?_ @danielmoore4024¬† If you didn't have a disability, it wouldn't be a diagnosis. That's the reason psychopathy isn't a diagnosis (because psychopaths function well in fields like military, law enforcement, and business). You've been diagnosed with a disability for a reason. If you had self awareness then you'd understand why._ @danielmoore4024¬† Thank you for bringing that up. This user doesn't even act like a true professional and yet he believes he's right in everything (with no evidence what-so-ever to boot)._ @filipeflower¬† Lol this just goes to show that you're trolling. Now you're making false claims that you replied when in reality you never did. You're obviously just trying to get a reaction out of me! üòÇ_ @platosocrates9350¬†  First of all, you're the definition of trolling. That little emoji (\"üòÇ\") is evidence of that. Secondly, you need better eye sight, because I literally posted a comment 1 day ago. It says right there on top. And you're saying you've been awake for two days? That is the biggest bullcrap I've ever seen so far._ @filipeflower¬† I have offered you plenty of evidence, but you continue to ignore it for the sake of your narcissism. You want to feel like you're special._ @airbreather9816¬† You still believe we're idiots now?_ @platosocrates9350¬† Oh, really? Where's that evidence? Show it._ @filipeflower¬† I'm a troll for using emojis? Umm ok? You're the one making false accusations, insulting & mocking me, lying, and acting abhorrently as a whole. I feel bad for you really. What drove you to the point that you have to spend your days trolling random people on the internet?_ @platosocrates9350¬† Emojis of mocking laughter after a mockery comment, to be more specific. I already posted a list of the unproven accusations you threw at me (and also at Daniel). You're not expecting me to repeat that, are you?\nAnd before you accuse anyone of lying or whatever, evidence is required. You never did that. I don't see any links or prints in your comments anywhere. You call that plenty of evidence?\nAnd third, I didn't troll anyone. The only person I've replied to these days was you right here (and Daniel, but I sympathize with him). You've spent just as much time as I have with this silly debate, so who exactly are you to talk about it?_ @filipeflower¬† There your brain goes again. Sigh. Under that context, my emoji was laughing at the fact that you clearly don't understand what your talking about to a laughable degree. I wasn't laughing at you, I was clearly laughing at your poor argument. I haven't made any false accusations whatsoever. You, however, have made countless false accusations, notably accusing famous scientists of secretely having disabilities so that you can prop yourself up. It's obvious you're trolling, and you're not funny._ @platosocrates9350¬† \nWhy must I see autism as a bad thing, why are you so desperate for me to feel sorry for myself? Just because something's labelled \"disability\" doesn't make it a bad thing, if you knew the truth you would know that the only people who believe disability is a bad thing are those who taught themselves disability is a bad thing.\n\nThe truth is \"disability = disability\" with the disability been man-made which is why even though the condition has always existed, it wasn't taught to be a disability until mankind began teaching it to be a disability less than one century ago.\n\nThe truth is \"autism = autism\" and that's why it wasn't seen as a problem, unfortunately people like yourself don't live by the truth, instead you live by the delusional belief \"diversity = bad\".\n\nJust like neurotypical people have your disabling traits, autistic people are no different.\nJust like neurotypical people have abilities, autistic people have abilities outside of your limited size box. You are not \"able\", you are \"en-abled\", everything is designed to suit you.\n\nAs this is my last response to you, I love being autistic for there is so much I've achieved in life that I would not of achieved if I were neurotypical. I would be such a wasteful person, another trait of neurotypical people. I wouldn't be able to concentrate on my goals so well because I'd be desperate for social activity, socializing obsession is another neurotypical trait of nonautistic people. I would just throw away my values just to fit in, being a faggit is another trait of nonautistic people, too fearful to be different. I can label one behaviour of neurotypical people as a deficit after another, that's what diagnoses you as \"normal\".\n\nNormal is a social construction, meaning abnormal is a social construction by men and women. You label anything that differs to the majority \"disability\" when you're the creators of abnormal/disability without even acknowledgeing your own disabilities showing arrogance is another trait of neurotypical people. Neurotypical people are the creators of discrimination and racism because they differ to the majority and the majority is a social construction. If I asked you all for a definition of \"normal people\" then about yourself, none of you would align with your own definition of \"normal people\" showing there's no such thing as a normal person and you're all fake, you are not actually who you display yourselves as, inauthenticity is another trait of neurotypical people.\n\nI love not having your disability, I will always prefer to be autistic and never involved with your creation of discrimination and racism. The main trait of neurotypical people is wickedness, and \"normal\" is your disability._ @danielmoore4024¬† Okay, I'm back. Well explainned. If more people could stop discrimination, this world would be a somewhat better place to live._ @danielmoore4024¬† Disability means \"Removal of ability.\" Not, \"You're a super talented genius because you don't have social skills or friends and watch my little pony in your mom's basement all day.\"  And if you were really an intelligent genius like you thought you were then you'd know autism wasn't even a word before 100 years ago. You don't want to be normal because you think we're feminine while you literally justify yourself watching My Little Pony? Lol... Yeah, you should go ahead and stop trying to argue, thanks. It's hurting your dignity so much more than me._ @filipeflower¬† There is no discrimination except you rebelling against society for no reason other than you not liking it. You have nobody to blame but yourself._ @platosocrates9350¬† Gaslighting alert! Who said I was rebelling against whatever society you're refferring to?_ @danielmoore4024¬† By the way, why did Plato Socrates mentioned My Little Pony to you in the first place? How's that related to this discussion?_ @filipeflower¬† The fact that you're calling our basic social norms and hygiene \"discrimination.\"_ @platosocrates9350¬† In what comment did I (supposedly) said that?_ @filipeflower¬† \"If more people could stop discrimination, the world would be a better place!\" How short is your memory lol?_ @platosocrates9350¬† But where is the \"hygiene\" mentioned there?\nEdit: Next time you want to quote someone, use \"copy & paste\"._ @filipeflower¬† In this case, basic social norms and hygiene refer to showering daily and not pooping in front of people at the park. And also not watching my little pony all day in your mom's basement (along with other various acts of degeneracy)._ @platosocrates9350¬† Again, I ask...what part of my previous comment mentions those things such as Hygiene or pooping in the Park?_ @hllyenaylleth9576¬† That user you were communicating with is just another mis-information troll._ @filipeflower¬† \nI have no idea what this pony even is, it's the first thing he wrote._ @danielmoore4024¬† Oh, so you didn't know then. It's basically a cartoon about talking ponies that used to be for the female crowd and it's for everyone since 2010._ @filipeflower¬† \nI never knew that as I'm not a TV person, I do things like reading, studying, playing the piano, Tai Chi and as a Christian some religious practices._ @danielmoore4024¬† Oh, I had no idea. Speaking of reading, there's three books I havent finished reading yet. The three musketeers is one of those._ @filipeflower¬† Those are called basic social norms, and people with autism violate them on a daily basis. And you're trying to justify it._ @filipeflower¬† Don't forget your My Little Pony coloring book lol_ @platosocrates9350¬† Are you even paying attention to what I asked? What part of my previous comment mentions hygiene or whatever? You brought up that subject, not me. You've been putting words in my mouth.\nBut just letting you know, most what you consider \"social norms\" are not even registered in the law. So what right do you have to force everyone to be like yourself? Seriously, it's not like you're a police officer or something like that. We're all different.\nThe only thing I'm justifying are basic human rights for Autistic people. For example, here in my country, Autistic people have been accepted in jobs. I happen to be one of those. I suggest you do more research about it so you can learn it. Google would be a good start.\nAlso, did you know that, in my country, Autistic people get payed a certain amount of euros per month depending on their level of capacity? It's true. I used to have that, until I found my job. Once you find a job, they stop that kind of help. Speaking of which, it's 6:20 am. I'll have to prepare myself once again...for my job, that is.\nBy the way, I don't use coloring books. But even if I did, what business do you have in my life?_ @artistic spider Welcome, friend. Daniel Moore and I are both autistic and we have no problem with that. It's prejudiced people (such as some of the trolls here (such as Plato Socrates)) who are trying to convince us otherwise. But one thing you can realize is that the term \"normal\" is subjective. What might be considered \"normal\" in some places might not be considered \"normal\" in other places and vice-versa. And just because someone is in the majority, doesn't mean they are automatically right. Don't forget that the LGBT+ crowd didn't even have legal rights back then, because of people's prejudice, but now they do. It'll be the same with the Autistic crowd when it comes to acceptance. It's only a matter of time (and dedication). Until then, don't let prejudiced people bring you down. Remember, you have friends who can help you. Good luck.üçÄüçÄ_ @artistic spider \nI always ask people on the spectrum to look for their strengths and not spend so much time on weaknesses.\nLike there's lots of nonautistic people terrible at algebra, but we don't find them focusing on algebra or any other of their weaknesses so why should we. \n\nIdentify what your strengths are and spend more time there, once someone accepts their autism and sees themselves as PhD. Thomas Armstrong says \"Differently-Abled\" things get easier. So many inspirational people throughout history were neurodivergents including autistic people because our brains are wired differently._ @danielmoore4024¬† Ok, if that Plato Socrates user comes back, I won't be here to reply until Sunday afternoon. I have something else to take care of. Until then, be patient. Take good care of yourself and always deny any discrimination/prejudice from people with bad intentions. Take care. See ya later, buddy.

I've been a martial arts teacher, am a pianist for a church and music composer, a fine artist, a grand chess master, a mathematician, a philosopher, a counselor for parents with autistic children and live independently.\nI'd say I doing all these things is evidence fanatic Plato has no idea what he/she's talking about._ @danielmoore4024¬† Okay, I'm back now.

There is no scientific basis to calling these pathological, they're only called pathological through cultural prejudice._ @Karen Johnson \nThat's not the problem, the problem is you don't teach autistic people in ways that we understand, you selfishly and arrogantly force your ways on to us even though they don't make sense and are so twisted.\n\nYou design environments that are unsuitable for autistic people once again been selfish making everything evolve around you.\n\nYou're apporling at reading autistic people, you're apporling at communicating and interacting with autistic people which is why we struggle to understand you and you struggle to understand us but are too arrogant to even acknowledge that.\n\nWe can do things you CAN'T do, didn't you just say something making you unable to do something makes you disabled? Neurotypical is a disability as well, all neurodivergent people have abilities neurotypical people are not and never will be capable of meaning you're disabled.  \n\nNeurotypical people are simply too arrogant to acknowledge your weaknesses and oppress the neurodivergent population through cultural prejudice, you have something called EEAM Syndrome, Everything Evolves Around Me Syndrome. \n\nNeurotypical people are extremely hypocritical and arrogant._ @Karen Johnson That depends on a lot of factors.

The problem is society, portraying differences as a scary thing, and only showing \"failure\" and the \"negative aspects\" of differences, may it be adhd, autism, or even conditiosn and illnesses. If society would show the real human nature behind conditions and differences, portray human traits and not fear, we'd be much stronger and much wiser. In the news, movies, documentaries; whatever difference, illness, condition a person may have, they always portray it in a way that it looks scary, alien, etc. This gives people the impression that it's not going to happen to them ever, because it's not of this planet, it's not human, and that if someone has it around them they're alien, not human, and scary.\nThis needs to be switched with the focus of empowering people, showing the nature of humanity in all it's forms.

This methodology of averaging takes us out of the range of particular individuals and places in their stead the idea of a pure mathematical value. The average of 12, 6, 8, 9, and 15 is 10, yet 10 isn't even represented in any of the original numbers - it's a new number, something else besides the actual reality of what is given. In the same way, there really isn't an \"average\" person anywhere; \"average\" merely represents a statistical artifact. For something that doesn't really have any tangible existence, the idea of \"normal\" certainly has been invested with a great deal of power in our society!\"\n(PhD. Thomas Armstrong, The Power of Neurodiversity Unleashing The Advantages of Your Differently Wired Brain) \n\nPeople with neurodevelopmental conditions are well above \"average\" in just as many areas as they are below \"average\". \n\n\"Psychiatry calls great elation 'a hypomanic disturbance,' which is like calling it a hilarious distress, and regards all heightened states, whether of chastity or sensuality, scrupulosity or carelessness, cruelty or compassion, as pathologically suspect - how little would a healthy life mean if its only goal were a middle condition between two extremes!

In some ways autism is an advantage: I have a high IQ, a good imagination,  I'm not tied down to conformity. But I also have some very real problems: social problems, saying and doing inappropriate things, not understanding the context of what's going on. These are some real issues, so I can't completely endorse the \"autism is a good thing\" point of view._ @janorhypercleats¬† Have you tried talking to a true professional about that?_ We need to accept that people can choose genders, men abortion rights, men right to choose, and inclusion of all genders._ @janorhypercleats¬†\nI understand your view, I see autism as neither good nor bad.

It's been seen throughout history what you define as bad or malfunctioning was actually good functioning in the future.\n\nLook at the direction our world is moving in, open your eyes. What is our world's main form of communication? Social media, even when they're sitting right in front of each other. \nHow much body language, facial expressions, gestures, eye contact, tones of voice, vocal communication, nonverbal communication is required to communicate on social media? \nNone, all those \"social skills\" are becoming useless as times moving forward. \n\nWhat about crystallized intelligence vs fluid intelligence? \nOur physical world is rapidly evolving that we are not going to be able to rely on crystallized intelligence, we need more fluid intelligence, and guess what? \nAutistic brain functioning provides more fluid intelligence than crystallized intelligence. \n\nWhen we look at what you're defining as malfunctioning, it's those malfunctions that are responsible for the development and progression our world has made. \nDo things the \"normal\" way and you're only going to get \"normal\" day to day outcomes. It takes thinking and functions in a as you say malfunctioning way to come up with anything new to stimulate progression. \nYou cannot solve a problem with the same level of consciousness that created it, do things the way you've always done them and you'll only get what you've already got, nothing more. \n\nDo you know why these genes persist?\nBecause the human race cannot survive without them, they offer an advantage to the population as a whole for its survival, you clearly haven't researched autism._ @indisummers4385¬† Are you saying Autistic brains aren't healthy?_ @indisummers4385¬† What damage?_ @danielmoore4024¬† I have autism, and I have been studying medicine for 10 years. A passionate hyper-focus, as well.\nAutism has been more heavily researched, starting in the 80s. Break throughs were made by Greek physician, Theo Theoharides, but he isn't the only one who has come to the following conclusions. \n\nIt starts as a genetic component that causes neuroinflammation/CNS inflammation, and generalized, low-grade inflammation in the rest of the body. \n\nAutistics have a higher saturation of Microglia (immune system of the CNS), and very hyper-active Mast cells (neuroimmune cells that degranulate and relase inflammatory mediators). They also often have decreased white matter in the brain. \n\nAs you'll notice, many autistics also have other immunal manifestations, often autoimmune diseases (I have one called, Mast Cell Acivation Syndrome). \nCommon ones are Ezcema, Psoriasis, Kerotoconus, a variety of immune mediated Myalgic diseases, Lupus, ect.. People with autism are also chronically low in vitamins and minerals, innately, and sometimes mediated by genes that make them poor absorbers, or low synthesizers of nutrients. \n\nMany are comorbid with Ehler's Danlos Syndrome, and other connective/hypermobile tissue disorders, Marfanism, and high saturation of Histamin in the gut, of which causes GI distress and dysfunction. The brain is intimately connected to the gut, via a network called the Gut-Brain Axis. \n\nI understand that we now exist in a culture that is obsessed with inclusivity and being politically correct, but as a result, science has really taken the hit. \n\nAutism is a disease. It can create a unique and beautiful mind, but it is not a state of wellness, nor should we ignorantly dismiss the overwhelming evidence-based fact, that it is not just a neurotype, but an immunal dysfunction, with majorly uncomfortable symptoms that impact and even torment some individuals, daily._ @danielmoore4024¬† Do you know what the word spectrum means?_ @kaylacarpenter272¬†\nYes I do, are you aware humans don't even know what autism is?\nIf you've kept up with the research you would know none of the research has been about learning what is autism?\nIt's all been based on curing autism.\n\nI am autistic 24, 7. So if all these symptoms have anything to do with autism shouldn't they be occurring right now as I'm still autistic?\nHave you ever considered they have nothing to do with autism at all? \n\nYou're obviously another who practices scientism._ @kaylacarpenter272¬†\nAll the things you've listed have just been associated with autism and have multiple causes.\nCure things like GI problems and the autism is still there, stop things like sensory issues and the autism is still there etc...\n\nOnce you disassociate all the things you've associated with autism, the autism will still be there, so what will the autism be?\n\nAll the problems you've listed also occur to nonautistic people, so is it really an autism thing or are autistic people just more likely to develop these issues?\n\nWhat people like yourself call the autism spectrum is actually a stockpiled collection of distinct separate conditions placed under the title autism. That's why the spectrum persistently broadened, they just slotted one condition after another on top burying autism that they don't even know what autism is creating The Autism Industrial Complex proven by Professor Alicia Broderick. \n\nSensory issues were once called Sensory Processing Disorder, a separate and distinct condition to autism, not autism itself.

I have no intention of doing anyone harm, nor would I suggest that danger is present when it is not.  \nNor is this a stratagem for persuading the resistant of the validity of Biblical doctrine.   Since they will not listen, they will have to experience and recognize its validity for themselves at some later time.  \n\nTry as hard as one might, one can't evade the truth forever.  But resistance is par for the course: \n(1st Corinthians 2:14)   'But a natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually appraised.'   \n\nWhy don't you stop caviling and put your knowledge to more productive use, if you think that your own worldview is correct?      \nYou're getting nowhere with me._ @jesusislordsavior6343¬† Dude, in case you haven't noticed, nobody here cares about your beliefs. And yes, that did look like a threat (or something that implies it). All you've been doing is nothing more than trying to convince everyone of your beliefs and trying to look wise at the same time. If others don't want what you share with them, the least you can do is stop, respect and walk away. But no, you're doing the opposite of that.\nAs for my knowledge, you don't know what I'm doing with it in real life, so don't try to judge me, when you don't know  who you're communicating with._ @filipeflower¬† \n1.  You cannot actually demontrate the validity of your first initial statement.  In fact I have seen the occasional exception.   \n\n2.  It is not my concern whether others care about 'my' beliefs.  It is my concern that they should follow JESUS, so as to be saved.  My personal feelings or opinions are of very little consequence, except infosar as they reflect His.   \n\n3.  YOUR feelings and opinions are ALSO of very little consequence, except insofar as they reflect His-------------which clearly they do not.  Your mind is full of bad ideas, ideas which will not profit you in the end.\n\n4.  I do NOT regard it as my job to 'convince' ANYONE.   I thought that I had told you this already.   I have no illusions in that regard.  However, it is my RESONSIBILITY to tell people about Jesus and the salvation which is available through Him.   INFORMING people or REMINDING them is NOT the same as trying ot convince them.  \n\n5.  Given that a majority of people online are opposed to Christianity, given that Christians are widely DESPISED, your suggestion that I am trying to 'look wise' is completely RIDICULOUS. \n\n(1st Corinthians 2:14)  'But a natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiirtually appraised.'   \n\n6.  I understand your opposition perfectly, but I do not understand why you waste your time making futile and senseless objections.\n\nIf you like the way you are, if you think that your own wisdom is sufficient to see you through your life until the end, providing you with joy and peace and making you a valuable servant of society, I have nothing to say to you.  Go your way, and discover the long-term consequences of unbelief for yourself._ @jesusislordsavior6343¬†\nStandardising humanity is the biggest and most foolish error past scientists ever made, due to the lack of fluid thinking of nonautistic people they don't realise that what scientists who are looking for cures are actually doing is trying to prevent general human evolution.\nWhat a foolish and flawed belief they all have, that scientists have the ability to prevent human evolution? \n\nIn science we are to apply the same principles to everything, so the principles which apply to us must be applied to everyone. \nSo if they're going to continue claiming we're disabled because our brain functioning and development prevent us being able to do certain things, we must apply the same principle to \"normal\" brains meaning they're disabled because their brain functioning and development prevents them from being able to do things we can do, so they've got brain dysfunctions as well, the difference is their dysfunctions are accommodated for while they ignored our needs when designing the environment.\n\nAll the milestones are artificial, man-made expectations, they are not actually real. If there's diversity in brain development we should expect diversity in human development, due to diversity in genetics we should expect diversity in everything about the human condition. Everyone develops at different paces, and there's no scientific formula to determine how far away from the milestones a person must be in order to be called \"delayed\" meaning there is no such thing as \"developmental delay\", it should be called \"developmental diversity\". \n\nHere's just how flawed normality is and how their methodology works;\nIf the majority of the world had the ability to read music and about 10% didn't, they would define that 10% as dysfunctional, put numerous funding towards finding out what's \"wrong\" with them. That is precisely what scientists did to gay people less than a century ago, just because it did not align with their nonexistent \"normal\" brain they automatically labelled them pathologically disabled.\nAs human evolution continues more minorities will be identified and they will automatically label them pathologically disabled even though they are not, just like gay never was a pathological disorder. That correction was not because of science, it's because as they began focusing more on newer minorities gay people blended in.\n\nNormality is the biggest disability, it's why \"normal people\" are the least creative, the least radical, the least innovative people on this earth.\nCreativity is not \"normal,\" radical thinking is not \"normal,\" innovative thinking is not \"normal,\" they are all outside of the box.\nThey're so held back by normality and social convention because of their brain functioning, we can say \"normal people\" have SDD, Social Dependency Disorder.\n\nThe mutants behind autism offer some great advantages to the human race, diminishing the genes is a great risk because without those mechanisms there is no asurety of genetic stability pushing us in the direction of extinction. \n\nOliver Sacks points out;\n\"On the whole, for the past century, clinical neurology has looked at illnesses, diseases, damages, abnormalities.

(Btw I'm not American.) \n\nSIN ('hamartia') is 'missing the mark', not 'being all that we can be'.\n'FOR ALL HAVE SINNED AND FALL SHORT OF THE GLORY OF GOD.'\n'FOR THE WAGES OF SIN IS DEATH.'    \n\nYes, in ordinary life as in military operations, mistakes can be deadly.\n \n\nIf we disobey our own conscience, we are sinners with regard to the standards of that conscience.   If we fall short of God's Law as expressed in (say) the Ten Commandments, we are sinners with regard to the LAW.\n\n(James 2:10) 'IF ANYONE KEEPS THE WHOLE LAW AND YET STUMBLES IN ONE POINT, HE IS GUILTY OF ALL.'  \n\nSince we have established GENDER EQUALITY as a basic principle in a previous post of mine, women are as accountable as men.   \n\nGuess what?   HUMAN  RESPONSIBILITY is so clearly a cause of evil in this world, that trying to impugn God for the existence of evil is PERFECTLY USELESS.   It WILL NOT get us off the hook._ @PutinsMommyNeverHuggedHim¬† \nSince you've decided to go 'intellectual' and try some quotes, I'll make a few brief remarks.  \n\n1.  WHY did you select C.S. Lewis?   His book, 'Mere Christianity', helped me along the path toward a living faith, when I was not attending church at all.  Later on I read a few others.   'The Screwtape Letters' shows clever insight into the nature of evil.   But lack of any Scriptural knowledge would impoverish one's reading.   You must realize that in his generation, even impious people often had some knowledge of the Bible.   Nikita Khrushchev was one example.   \n\n2.  Lincoln himself reported after the fact that he had not become a Christian until after the death of his son.   This happened during the Civil War.   I think his heart softened toward black slaves at that time, too, because previously he would have kept slavery to save the Union.  \nThe quality of mercy SHOULD accompany Christian faith.   The Emancipation Proclamation expressed mercy whereas the retention of slavery did not.  \n\nYour quote exemplifies the simplistic attitude of Deists, who accept God's existence through GENERAL REVELATION but not those SPECIFIC revelation to Israel and the Church which we find in the Bible.  Some of the American 'founding fathers' were Deists.   The doctrine is intellectually much better than atheism, but still very primitive.   I would call it the NATURAL RELIGION os secular Man (Man/Woman)._ @jesusislordsavior6343¬†  Have you read the Gospel of Judas or the Gospel of Thomas?_ @PutinsMommyNeverHuggedHim¬† \nI have dealt in detail with quotations from two men whom I respect, belated believers according to self-report.  \n\nMost else you quote is sheer bigotry and hatemongering.   A person should be ashamed for approving such views.   Mark Twain was a good writer, but artistry does not make one righteous in character. \nNor does a magnificent reputation on earth mean that one will be \nfondly remembered in perpetuity.\n\n(Psalm 49:20)  'Man in his pomp, yet without understanding, is like the beasts that perish.'  \n\nOr shall we say Man/Woman in his/her pomp and glory?   Yes, we shall. \nNO FAVORITISM here._ @jesusislordsavior6343¬†  sigh‚Ä¶. there‚Äôs no hate like Christian love_ @PutinsMommyNeverHuggedHim¬† \nI have not, will not, and there is no reason why I should.  The canon was completed toward the end of the 1st century A.D., at the very end of the apostolic generation, and the Holy Spirit guided the Church as to which writings ought to be accepted.   Mere human opinion did not guide the Church.   However I realize this distinction means nothing to you.  \n\nThe problem with many churches today is that they are guided by human opinion in defiance of the Holy Spirit and the CLEAR instruction of Scripture.   However they fail to increase their numbers as hoped by this compromise.   \nSo the global South is where we see a real expansion of the Church in this generation.  \n\nYou have set before me a big, fat RED HERRING.   Serious Christians do not take this rabble-rousing seriously.  \n\nBtw I did once read the intertestamental Apocrypha.   If one has a sense of taste, one can tell the difference between sweet and bitter.  If one has spiritual taste, the difference in quality between canonical and apocryphal is quite evident._ @PutinsMommyNeverHuggedHim¬†\nThere is a grain of truth in that, insofar as Christians are commanded to hate evil.\nThis we could do better.  .\nToo often we tolerate it in ourselves, and sometimes we do not speak out against it boldly enough on a wide enough range of issues.   We were never called upon to be supporters of 'status quo'.    \n\nBut are you familiar with the various Greek words for love, like 'agape', 'storge', 'philia',\nand 'eros'?    Look these up, and you will see that the English word is comparatively vague.   This vagueness can lead to misinterpretation, misuse, and false expectations.   \n\nIf God's desire is to save us from destruction, and one person tells another the proper escape route, why should offense be taken? When others preached to me, I understood that their motivation was loving, even though I did not like them or their message very much._ Remember. There are people who understand so don't give up. :)_ @Sinfully-handsome¬†\nTo be honest I don't think there is, especially as people are promoting the idea they can prevent human evolution, bring humanity to extinction, and fail to realise so much science behind disabilities is dogmatic as it is based on man-made narratives.\n\nHow many people do you know who have noticed \"social behaviour\" is the origin of discrimination, racism, sexism, ableism, and all the other 'isms?_ @PutinsMommyNeverHuggedHim¬† \nAnd there is no love like that o CHRIST HIMSELF.\n(Romans 5:8)  'For God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.'\n\nWhat, by comparison, do you have to offer?_ @PutinsMommyNeverHuggedHim¬†\nIf we didn't know what suffering feels like, we wouldn't know what peace feels like, we can't recognise one without the other.\n\nIf you wish to have free will you require opposition in all things, if you've only got one side, you've got no choice, all choices have already been made.\n\nI like how the Chinese illustrate it with the Yin-yang symbol._ @danielmoore4024¬†  I think you replied to the wrong person._ @PutinsMommyNeverHuggedHim¬†\nNo I didn't, it was you talking about a God that would allow suffering, that's why he doesn't make suffering nonexistent._ @danielmoore4024¬† I was wondering why you become aggressive when I did not comment bad things about you so I scrolled to the end and I saw my mistake. Sorry, I am referring to Plato Socrates by their confusing justification. XD._ @platosocrates9350¬† ‚Äã @Plato Socrates You are embarrassing the name of famous philosophers name by putting it on as your username. So disgusting._ @PutinsMommyNeverHuggedHim¬† \nRemember His precept, 'by your standard of measure it will be measured to you.'    He has not appointed you as Jude over the Church._ @Sinfully-handsome¬† \nOk, I‚Äôll delete the response_ @PutinsMommyNeverHuggedHim¬† \nI do not live in the USA!!   Attend to your own business as a country.\nTry to hold yourselves together if you can.  Each 'side' has plenty for which to apologize, but I don't see people in a mood for apologies.      \n\nI did study there, and was converted at that time (1982).  I am by no means unacquainted with American Christianity.   Your effort at simplistic reduction is ABSURD, given the ACTUAL cultural and subcultural DIVERSITY among American Christians.   \n\nDon't forget that African-Americans have lively churches of their own, pillars of the community in fact---------------not to mention countless IMMIGRANT churches.   Bear in mind that Christianity came from the JEWS, that Europe was originally PAGAN-----------besides which there is NO SUCH THING as a 'white race', from a scientific perspective.    \n\nIf you do not understand Christianity, you do not understand Fascism either.  Try reading Zeev Sternhell (the Israeli historian) on this subject.   Don't use the F-word as an epithet to LABEL whatever you find unacceptable.   That's not political science.   Republicans do the same with the S-word ('socialism').  It's plain silly.    \n\nThe essence of Fascism is the SUPREMACY of Government over ALL aspects of life, so that the interests of the Individual are submerged in the interests of the State.  Check it out.  Trump may want to be dictator, but that in itself does not make him a fascist!   Xi Jinping of China is MUCH closer to the mark.   Have you ever analyzed Chinese propaganda?   \n\nTrump is not smart enough to have organized ideas about anything, political science and the Bible included.  He just knows what 'works for him' and has no sense of 'fair play'.   \n\nTHIS  is why he should be expelled from US politics, not because 'abortion rights' need protection.   There are no 'abortion rights'; they are made up by humans to justify killing other humans, whose existence seems inconvenient.      \n\nWhat needs to be respected is a woman's right to say 'no' to a man.\nBut once she has said 'yes'. neither she nor the man have any 'right' to say NO to the child which 'accidentally' develops in the womb as a result.  \n\nWhat is welfare for??    If a lady is abandoned, PAY her to keep her child to term.   Make the rich pay.   They have more than they need._ @PutinsMommyNeverHuggedHim¬† \nDon't have too much confidence in your own agency.   Americans seem particularly prone to that error.    No, you CANNOT determine your own destiny; you CANNOT invent your own set of FACTS.   \n\nI think I addressed a similar comment earlier.  Your initial statement, though it may sound amusingly erudite to your own ears, reveals the GROSS prejudice in your  heart.    A lot of these folks voted for Trump for one reason only, because he cast his lot with the anti-abortion movement. \nThey used him, as he used them.    I would recommend a more comprehensive pro-life platform involving GUN CONTROL but ALSO outlawing abortion-on-demand.  \n\nCertainly NOT all Christians in the USA are Trump supporters.   Nor are all Republicans btw.   Former Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, a centrist and a believer, refused to have anything to do with the Trump movement.   Besides, you FORGET about so many African-American pastors who are critical of Trump and what he represents.  \n\nNEVER FORGET the role of the churches in the Abolitionist and Civil Rights movements.   OK, I understand that young people today are interested in 'retro' politics, which may account for the rediscovery of Karl Marx.   It's true that Marx sent a congratulatory telegram to Abraham Lincoln when Lincoln was re-elected in 1864.   But Marx NEVER did any heavy lifting on behalf of social justice.  The churches DID, and STILL DO.   \n\n...........................................\n\nNow it's not as though you didn't have 'idols' of your own.   Whatever a person puts before God, that is his idol, functionally speaking.   Clearly God does not interest you very much, so why are you caviling?   \n\nQuite possibly never were part of the fold, if you think this way.   Those who sit in pews are not sanctified thereby.   Jesus said that unless one is 'born again' he/she cannot see the kingdom of God.   Not to see is not to perceive and not to attain.   \n\nBe sure that being 'born again' is a metaphor for spiritual regeneration, NOT a peculiarly culture-bound and quintessentially American expression of religious subculture!!! \n\nFor the Bible does NOT mention America even once, not even obliquely. \nNo, you Americans asre NOT the 'chosen people', though you often tell the rest of the world that you are, and send in troops uninvited to reinforce the point. \n\nI can understand why you would like the current guy in Rome, Mr. Bergoglio, because he is P.C. on most issues---------------being an ecclesiastical politician by trade.   \n\nThe theology of Mr. Bergoglio (a.k.a. 'Francis') is heretical, which should endear him to you.   He has said that 'good atheists' may go to heaven.\nHowever Jesus, being God, has said that NO ONE is good except God.\nTo think otherwise is extremely presumptuous.  :\n\n(Romans 3:23)  'For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.'\n\n(Psalm 53:1)   'The fool has said in his heart, \"There is no God.\"   \nThey are corrupt, and have committed abominable injustice.'\n\nGnosticism is all about the illusion of having 'special knowledge', of being a cut above the rest of humanity.   It's the perfect religion for snobs._ That is so true_ Which is just bizarre to me how it came to be because all of them have positive aspects that can make them useful to society. All and every single one of them. Also it brings in the fact that women are a minority even though we make up half of the population, and perhaps even more of it. It is not a world where people reject diversity, it is a world where you're not human unless you're a white man, and I think that is important to focus on_ Capitalism_ That's a gross oversimplification of the reality._ Most aren‚Äôt afraid of it but it has a ton of physical issues that they have to deal with.. and need help learning how to take care of themselves or ask for what they need or not suffer from emotions. it‚Äôs just we should try and see the nutrients missing could help them learn and thrive_ Wrong and reductive. You're assuming that autism/adhd/and other cognitive deficiancies are not caused by external pollutants like heavy metals or other immune adjuvants. If it was simply a genetic mutation, limited to a number of individuals whom nobody could predict or account for, that wouldn't change the fact that we as a community should still ;  A.)\n   Try our best to eliminate anything that reinforces said cognitive itinerary decline and B.) Support the increased cognitive function that a brain which has been damaged by blood/brain barrier breaches faces by helping it in the same we we aid stroke victims in remapping the abilities they have lost by the stroke but can easily be regained in time with various therapies.\nAutism IS an outcome that could happen to any of us.

I believe in you ‚ù§_ @madriver2202¬†\nWhat about the abilities you'll terminate by doing so?\nNeurodivergent people can do things neurotypical people are incapable of, why should we throw these additional skills away?_ I'm sorry you had to endure that._ Aren't you generalizing?_ I was like, his voice sounds weird, did that come with his autism too? What I forgot to realize is that he's talking infront if a group of people and my autistic butt wouldn't come across 1/7th as good._ I am pretty certain that, after having experienced 34 years of my life, that I am on the Autistic spectrum. I haven't been tested, mainly because I don't really know how to do it, but also because I don't really think there's a need to at this point.\n\n-I don't like loud noises.\n-I don't know how to express emotions and when people express emotions towards me, I don't know how to act. A lot of what I do is mimicry.  I mimic what I've seen people do.\n-I don't like eye contact. It \"burns.\" When I force myself to look into people's eyes, or if it happens by mistake, I literally tear up a bit as though something's in my eyes. I've learned to \"look past\" people's heads though, or to stare at their forehead in order to give the illusion of making eye contact.\n-I don't like skin-to-skin contact. Intimacy in any relationship (which I avoid because it's uncomfortable) is unbearable to me. I don't mean sexual relations necessarily, but just things like hugging, hand shakes, etc. Yet, I'll do it if I'm forced to or have to. But I do it awkwardly.\n-I often repeat myself. Like I'm on loop. It's like I can't find the end to an explanation or something.\n-I can't carry on a conversation. It always just ends awkwardly with me trying to move on with something else. I can't start conversations either. I try to, but just dig myself into a hole where I don't know how to end it.\n-I don't know how to build personal relationships, but have to rely on others to approach me with an interest to do so. I'm extremely shy.\n-I'm socially awkward.\n\n\nIt's not all bad though...\n-I'm very engineering inclined. I can build almost anything, fix almost anything, and can think outside the box in order to solve problems.\n-I'm great at building plastic models and painting them.\n-I'm imaginative. Often daydreaming even though I'm an adult.\n-I put lots of dedication into what I do. Nothing is half assed, but nothing is 100% either. It's always 150% or more.\n-I can lock myself into a room and accomplish more than anyone else can.\n-I seem to be well liked by others... despite my awkwardness. I'm not popular by any means, but I can at least get along with people. I don't express hatred towards people I don't like. I just get along with them to do what we need to do, then I go home.\n\n\nSo yeah... I think I'm on the scale. Don't know where exactly, but I'm really good at \"masking.\" It stresses me out, but I've survived so far in the non-autististic world.\nIt's like being a monster in a way. You have to hide and blend in or else be discovered and then be treated differently or weirdly... or have a mob run after you with pitchforks.\nAnd I think that's why I don't want to be tested._ My life is governed at 70 mph._ World renowned Australian clinical psychologist, Dr. Atwood of would argue that autism is a higher form of evolution. That being said we are more involved than others, LOL_ This chap expresses the challenges very well and is a joy to listen to._ On behalf of my daughters with Autism, Thank You! Thank you so much for sharing your perspective.  It makes a difference!_ its just human beings are different,why this diagnosis and all,why labelling it like a disorder?when u said u r not diseased then why do u say that doctors diagnosed u as autistic disorder and all?why do u grow ur hair like this and dressed up differntly than others?its a psychology.a biggest scam of this decade_ You are one amazing human being._ Trigger warning: mentions of self-harm\n\nAs a girl seeking out a diagnosis, I'm coming across many challenges. I've told my family, but two out of the four I told flat-out told me I wasn't autistic. My mom said I was trying to act more autistic so it would \"look like I had autism\" but the truth is I've been hiding my autistic traits from a very early age. More recently she's come to terms with it, but I still have a lot of convincing to do on her part, despite the fact that she was the only person on the planet I showed my struggles to before I knew I had autism.\n\nI already knew how my brother was going to react, and he has told me that until I get an official diagnosis, I am not autistic.\n\nI've been hiding for so long that I don't even know where the mask ends and I begin. I blame religion for a lot of my struggles: Why I don't trust others, why I don't trust myself, and why I forced myself to bottle up everything and never show a soul how much pain I was in.\n\nThat kind of life isn't sustainable, and I found that out the hard way.\n\n\nI struggled with depression, anxiety, and self-harm. When I realized how badly I needed help, I tried desperately to explain what I felt. No matter how hard I tried, though, therapists were always \"pleased with my progress\" and psychiatrists always told me I only needed medication and \"mental tools\" and I would suddenly find life bearable again. Unsurprisingly, depression medication didn't fix everything like I thought it would. \n\n\nI had to do research on my own, ask questions on my own, and battle with my demons alone. I tried so hard to avoid using the phrase \"you don't understand\" but that was the only thing on my mind every time I cried to my mom about my struggles. No matter how many words I used, she still didn't see the full picture.\n\nI knew something was wrong, but I couldn't put it into words, no matter how much I enjoyed writing. \n\nNow I have a word, but it adds a whole new layer of complications to my life.\n\nAnd what if I'm wrong?_ Autism is for taxonomists._ Thank you for this informative video._ He's adorable_ Yes, nice hair.

They need a cure._ My little brother suffers from autism, and sometimes it makes it kind of hard for me and my family to understand him. I even worried that some of my friends, who are non-autistic, would ridicule me for having a disabled brother. But this video shows me that autistic people have no disease within them; they‚Äôre natural humans like the non-autistic, but they view the world alternatively._ I'm nonautistic but im suspecting my best friend has autism, so I searched this and omg everything he mentioned... even the way he acts, It's like he's my friend!\nThere was a time when i felt very disconnected from her, because she couldn't (and can't) express herself well but it was recently when I started thinking she may have autism, now im sure she has (not like im going to personally diagnose her) and I'm trying to get to know autistic people better.\nTo people here who are autistic, what do you struggle the most with? And what would you appreciate people said more/less?_ This guy is truly amazing and an inspiration to the ones with autism and even the ones who don‚Äôt have autism.

For us, it just blows our mind.\nNot understanding social cues or what people are saying: We literally take what you say as face value. If I said do you want to go for a coffee at some point, you might do the NT thing of sure, that would be great. This is a saying that works both ways, yeah that would be great, or no I don't want to go, but I am going to be polite.\nWe just hear you want to go so we get excited because you want to go for a coffee with us.\nThere is a lot more to it than that, but it hopefully gives you an idea of what it is like.\nAs for your friends, if they ridicule you then, quite simply, they are not your friends. It is something that I have learnt over the past couple of years. I tried to fit into friendships because I was afraid of being alone, but then I realised why am I fitting myself to them?

Some people love being autistic while others hate it but atleast more than 1 person has autism_ @maulanwong3841¬† Your right I don't see Autism as a terrible thing anymore. I have Aspergers so it's high functioning I'm able to live on my own_ i love u!_ You really expect us to believe that?_ @filipeflower¬† you can tell he‚Äôs a scammerüòÇpoor English, WhatsApp, the phone number_ @INDICATION002¬† Yeah. Report right away._ 0:20\nHow you gonna call me out like that, that first thing is me lmao_ Naturally human ‚ù§Ô∏è I liked that quote_ Do you ever deal with people misreading your emotions? For instance passion or attempts at humor often are misinterpreted as anger. It is extremely frustrating for me. Also I am unable to keep up with conversations. I can never find an opening and when I do the conversation has moved on. I ask bc I am trying to determine if I should push to get tested. I have done the available self-assessments/questionnaires and all point to ASD but it is pretty easy to tell what the expected answers are for determining ASD so not sure those tests are valid. I mean I could easily be convincing myself that I am autistic and thus answering appropriately_ I just got diagnosed with Autism at 32! I found this doing research. Thank you Ethan! Great description! üëè_ \"I don't like loud noises\" whole crowd screams and applauds twice._ Ethan guy is so great! I‚Äôm so thankful he spoke out against the stereotypes placed over our heads!_ Seems to me that not treating Autism as a disease that needs to be cured  would be more relevant for someone like the speaker who is on the higher end of the spectrum then someone who is so sever that they have to be closely watched like a toddler 24/7._ \"The thing that makes me overwhelmed all the time is loud noises\", audience feels bad for clapping and wooing. XD\nI don't think he minds that and they shouldn't feel bad, but I can see that being what happened just then. Though then at the end they did the same thing so maybe I'm wrong haha.\n\nI do not mask. I hold back but that's mostly out of fear because of my anxiety. Nobody should (have to) mask, I think some autistic people could mask less if they just could stop feeling the shame and care for what strangers think of them.\n\nAutism for sure isn't bad by default, and not something that need to be cured as a whole. Doesn't make sense to say either. But there are negative effects of autism, and it would be good if there was a way to \"cure\" these things. But there should also be efforts to some degree to increase the comfort for autistic people in the world._ Imagine a woman with ASD._ Thanks to everyone taking their time to read this testimony on how my son was saved from Autism. \nHe was diagnosed four years ago, and he's just 6, I have tried several treatments and medications, nothing was working out, this got me frustrated and depressed. I kept praying and finally God answered my prayers when someone from youtube introduced me to this doctor from his home country and  gave me his contact details.\nI called and explained my son's condition after which I made an order for his herbal remedy, he asked for my address and the next day I got a tracking number for a parcel sent to me through DHL and after four days I received my order. \nIt was a liquid herbal medicine and a letter containing the instructions on how to use the herbs, I called him again to confirm and the next morning I started giving my son the herbs as instructed and after one week I noticed great improvement on my son and I continued until the herbs got finished and everything lasted for just one month and now my son is totally free from Autism, he can now talk clearly, behave normally and has no more seizures.\nIf you've been searching for a genuine solution for Autism, connect with this honest Doctor on Whats App \n+ ( 2 3 4 8 0 7 7 6 8 3 1 0 9 )_ Omg this is very related to me. I have autism too, and I do mask myself as a normal person. I am very sensitive and emotional,and I used to burst out often. When I am older,I started to worried about people will think I am a weirdo. Good thing is that I have friends who don't mind me acting different. So don't worry, I am fine._ All of the 201 dislikes are Karen‚Äôs and they need to be ashamed of how they think!_ This video helped me have a better understanding of my condition. I‚Äôm still embryonic in the understanding of autism and how it may affect my life daily, but personal experience and videos like this help._ My 5 year old son is autistic,  love him_ I have autism and yet still see it as a disease because it decreases the normallity of thought and makes us think differently to normal people_ 1:08_ OMG thank you so much!_ What an awesome young man. Well done._ sadly the people that need to see this the most won't take the time to_ \"I actually have lots of empathy,\n I am just not good at showing it\"._ What's your point exactly?_ What do you mean?_ @filipeflower¬† I made the comment five month ago but if I were to guess there is a spectrum for Autism and what he's advocating would be more relevant for someone on the higher end than the lower end  ._ @celestialcircledance¬† All autistic people have rights too, you know._ @filipeflower¬†  I  wasn't commenting on rights in general but his specific proposal .  I made this comment five month ago  though and would really  need to listen  again  before having an in depth debate lol ._ @celestialcircledance¬† 5 Months isn't that long ago, compared to other comments I found._ @filipeflower¬† Its long enough for me not to remember details of the talk  . That some people commented many month earlier  is irrelevant . Maybe it even left more of a lasting impression on some of them so shoot me  ._ @celestialcircledance¬†  Ok, I apologize if I offended you, but I found so many comments discriminating autism._ @filipeflower¬† Its obviously something you feel very strongly about but I'm out of my depth ._ @celestialcircledance¬† Your what?_ @filipeflower¬† Be well and have a good night :)_ @celestialcircledance¬† You too, buddy._ What \"negative effects\" are those again?_ It already happened._ normal is subjective to every person_ Either you're lying or you don't understand that you don't need to change yourself just because there's a bunch of dislike you. Others have nothing to do with your personal life, you know. It's their fault, if they have prejudice against Autism, because they dont' have any knowledge of what that's like._ He wasn't talking about you._ @masonnix9566¬†  true._ @Faisal-tx9ii¬† \nI'd say the more accurate way of putting it is those of us Autistic don't display our emotions in the same way as nonautistic people, so nonautistic people misjudge how we feel because they can't tell just by looking that we're autistic.\n\nThe question was flipped over, for a few years now they've been investigating how well can nonautistic people read autistic people.\nWhat the researchers are finding is it's an exact reflection in all ways.\nNTs misinterpret how an autistic person feels and vice versa.\nNTs misinterpret autistic people in language and vice versa.\n\nEverything that is labelled \"deficit\" would be a deficit NTs if we put a NT in a school full of Autistic people. The only one struggling to understand people (deficits in communication and interaction) will be the nonautistic person.\n\nIt's called the Double Empathy Problem._ @danielmoore4024¬†  exactly. We are just quick to judge without knowing what's going on. Judgment becomes intensely inaccurate. Stay homeüò•_ @Faisal-tx9ii¬† Who is \"we\"?\nLike I said before he wasn't talking about you._ @masonnix9566¬†  brother, talgach tomar._ @masonnix9566¬† And?_ My son has loads of empathy as well._ @Karen Johnson What's your source for that?_ He has little cognitive empathy(not being able to express feelings u have for others)  but lots of effective empathy (feeling for others) psychopaths the other hand have it the other way around. People with pda which is a form autism that I have can express cognitive empathy but only a certain amount but enough to mask a lot more effectively than someone with ur average asd._ @alexmartin8166¬† best part about this is that we are extreme trust worthy_ Dr Yuching Lee¬† Lobotomy? Nice._ Dr Yuching Lee¬† shut it_ I know this feeling all too well. When I am working and someone gives me a gift, I feel bad for not being able to let them know that I truly appreciate the gift. I just hope people would understand autistic people more, I know it will take some patience but we would appreciate it tremendously._ When I was first diagnosed they said emotionless and lacked emotion and lacks empathy and I got mad I wanted to take the paper and rip it up. Inside I was screaming‚Äù you don‚Äôt know me! I‚Äôm not a robot!‚Äù I was feeling emotions and denial and took me a while to accept myself_ When I heard an explanation about  cognitive empathy vs emotional empathy; yeah that was one of those light bulb moments for me. The other big one was masking._ This comment happened right at the same time he said it_ @masonnix9566¬† yes he was_ Same, I want to express how sorry I am for things or how guilty I feel for ignoring others for ages, but it just doesn‚Äôt work well._ @masonnix9566¬†  brother, want to quarrel? I have some free time_ @readifdumb¬†ef no u arent_ @ yes_ Like controlling a volcano_ You can clearly see that the guy speaking, is in fact autistic._ Impressive talk Ethan, well done and thank you! \nI'm probably wrong, but thinking about it makes me feel that core autists are extreme in stimming, and so-called high-functional autists are trained and capable in masking. I hope that in future the world may adept and provide more and better opportunities for all people, regardless of how their brains work._ I hate that people tell me that my autism is a disability_ What they told me I had autism, that very second. People i was conversing with, my 2 therapists in rehab said, \"we're going to be talking differently, so you can understand us better\". I wasn't the one with the questions. So i got stamped. And some one else's world shifts. Very very weird_ Okey, I have autism._ People are trying to find a cure for autism because not everyone with autism is like you for some autism is  debilitating they can't speak or function in sociality at all. So while I agree not everyone with autism needs a cure my son is high functioning autistic and he is fine just the way he is but some are not as lucky some would like a better quality of life you can't put all autistic people in the same box_ As someone with high functioning. I agree with all of this_ How people with ASD can eventually respons to a certain person who talk to them with so many distortion (visual, auditory, etc)? I'm wondering whether the distortion is still there or its gone (feels more calm) when you guys give some respons when people talk to you?_ Thank you! My grandson has been diagnosed with autism .. he‚Äôll be playing then just get up and spin and spin .. he‚Äôs 4 .. thank you so much for the small insight_ Fart @ 1:09_ one of the sterotypes i have about autism is that many with autism like trains and or dinosaurs. I guess public transport counts too._ the only thing i hate is when people say \"autistic person\", because it makes it feel like the autism defines the individual. it also sounds like an insult. \"X is autistic\" sounds a lot worse than \"X has autism\"_ Bless him, he was so nervous, well done for getting that information out there_ 'its not true that autistic people are white males who speak in a monotone voice.' \nComing from the white male speaking in a monotone voice üòÇüëèüëè_ Being on the spectrum I can't fethom how much courage it must have taken Ethan to go on stage like this. Go Ethan!_ All those patronizing claps and cheers..._ To people who don't know much about asd. Everyone's asd is different and in different areas._ I sometimes catch somethign about people that nobody sees, not even themselves, i might be a little autistic, but im smart enough to blend in_ I‚Äôve been looking for the words for feelings & empathy issues and holy crap ‚Äúmy inner feelings are unlimited, but my mind only lets me express extremes or nothing‚Äù nails it_ Right because you‚Äôre high functioning. But that‚Äôs not always true. My nephew can‚Äôt talk yet, he‚Äôs 7. Sorry, that‚Äôs not a good thing._ Me too._ Obviously, the people who said that were prejudiced._ Well, good luck finding that, because it doesn't exist. If you can't accept autism, that's your problem._ @filipeflower¬† that's not what I said. Infact it's the exact opposite. I said some people want a cure for their autism, and they have the right to feel that way. Especially ones who have alot of trouble. I don't have autism so it's not my place to want anything but my son has autism and he is great and I wouldn't change him._ @marlenathorvald¬† Okay, in that case, that's different. But still, trying to cure autism just because you may see it as \"weird\" is like trying to cure homosexuality. It's just selfish and prejudiced. As an autistic person myself, I don't accept that._ @filipeflower¬† I Agree but I also think if someone who is autistic feels that way who am I to tell them how to feel do you know what I mean_ @filipeflower¬† as an autistic person you could talk to them about it in a different way then I could. I just don't think it's right for me to act like I know what's going on with them and I can tell them how to feel about it._ @filipeflower¬† like I said my son is autistic so I know more then more NT people but I still don't think that gives me the right to tell someone else about their autism and how to feel_ @marlenathorvald¬† I appreciate the concern._ Actually, no. It's the same thing as saying that person is tall or short. Nothing wrong with that._ He's right, you know._ Me too üò≠ he‚Äôs so strong and awesome!_ Fathom*_ I have so much respect for Ethan._ Pensei a mesma coisa, ele foi muito muito muito corajoso e confiante e falou muito bem. Tamb√©m sou autista, e uma coisa simples como subir em um palco para alguns pode ser um desafio imenso para algu√©m com autismo. Eu jamais teria feito algo assim. Ele foi impressionante_ For someone with autism, would they experience more anxiety in a situation like Ethan here doing this presentation‚Ä¶?\n\nI wonder if the anxiety would only be internalized and not externalized in physical signs of nervousness._ Wow I feel this. This explains a lot_ üò≠_ Even so, there are alternatives for that._ Autism is not a gift. It's a disability. Please don't tell yourself or anyone else that this serious problem is a good thing. Autism is increasing. \nAutism in government leads to autistic decision making. That hurts everyone_ Autism is a genetic condition whereby the individual is significantly challenged. The higher functioning ones can support themselves._ 1) his voice was a lot more higher pitched than I was expecting.\n2) so they treat autism as a disease? What about the other mental disorders that can be progressively debilitating the more severe it is? I know he‚Äôs Focus is autism but the way he describes it implies that that treatment is solely towards autism\n3) it‚Äôs more than just ‚Äúthinking differently‚Äù, it‚Äôs slowed mental development and a slowed ability to adapt mentally to situations, sometimes not even being able to adapt at all. It can feel like you‚Äôre trapped in your own head, knowing that you should be functioning at the same level as people in your age group but you just can‚Äôt, your brain can‚Äôt, and it‚Äôs very frustrating at times. Making long lasting relationships with people can be extremely difficult. \n4) hannah gadsby describes it better as being on a different wavelength than other people; like you‚Äôre the only sober person in the room or the only drunk one._ He seems like a really nice person._ I believe that the spectrum is basically the human mind trying to make leaps in evolution. It will probably be brains like yours that help us evolve into the next phase of unlocking our minds._ Amazing, very informative as well, nailed it._ I wish I was autistic. I wonder what it feels like to have multiple emotions at once. The only emotions I feel are either mad or sad._ I wish I had known I was autistic much earlier in life. From as young as I can remember up until this year, my life has basically been one big, self-imposed masking marathon. I'm 33 now._ You are awesome! Your confidence is inspring me,thanks!!_ this type of autism causes a severe lack of attention to non-communicating autism (the real autism). there needs to be a different name for the two because they are so drastically different_ Autistic People are like fine wine, we get better with time_ Each time I see something bright I sneeze. I hate mouth sounds. I hate loud breathes and people being loud overall. I don't like when people are not being direct because 70% of the time I will not get it. I get overwhelmed by looking at someone's face while talking to them. I sometimes don't understand that people are talking to me. It's hard to tell when I have to greet someone first. The list goes on and on._ I'm diagnosed with PDD-NOS which is a form of autism, these days you can't get diagnosed with it anymore. You'll just be ''on the spectrum''. But, I can find myself in almost nothing this person explains. I do have social anxiety, but is that really an autism trait?_ 4:25 - I swear that is a kinder egg toy_ This guy, is amazing, man, i hope he has a great life!!!_ AMEI, do fundo do meu core( cora√ß√£o) a palestra.\nEm um mundo em que as diferen√ßas s√£o vistas como algo problem√°tico e fora do normal, s√£o argumentos e experi√™ncias como essas, que nos permite enxergar muito al√©m da nossas pr√≥prias limita√ß√µes , principalmente como sociedade, comunidade e mundo._ You can't really go up on stage and tell people that their perception is wrong because that's not the way you see it. Normal people tend to see people with autism as \"dull\", \"weird\", \"annoying\" etc, all which you say is wrong. Just because you have autism and don't think that's true doesn't mean the rest of the world is wrong. Sure, maybe you do have empathy. You still seem emotionless to us.¬†\n\nI don't want to shame you. I don't have a problem with autistic people for being \"different\". Actually, different can mean cool and unique and awesome. If your way of being different is to speak to me like a robot while not understanding or being able to relate to me and to be only interested in your own special interests... To be completely unaware of what you seem like and make other people feel with your blindness and sole fixation on yourself... You'll make yourself look quite dumb and aloof a lot of times.¬†\n\nYou don't deserve to be bullied, of course not. But to most people, you ARE weird. You ARE annoying to them. You deserve love, as we all do, but you can't pretend like people are just being hateful if they don't love you.\n\nBut the part of it not being a disorder/handicap is the most willfully ignorant thing. You do realize that your incapability is a weakness, right? Humanity is not designed that way and society never will be designed to be most suited for atypical. Actually, the handicap does very much affect relationships and communication. Not being able to express yourself or figure out the right words to say does not make you a precious little butterfly. In fact, since the behavior is very similar to that of a psychopath, it is natural for people to avoid it. It's important that people can communicate with authentic emotions, because we can't otherwise protect ourselves from the most dangerous people. \n\nTo seem empathy-less, delusional, manipulative, crazy.... If we get vibes like that it's perfectly natural to avoid those people. Because those are more likely the people that will burn the whole building down and kill your entire family. People avoid you and call you \"weird\" and don't like you because they can't understand or trust you. You seem like a threat.¬†\n\nYou can't make society as a whole start treating those people like they're precious snowflakes. You can only try to work on your communication - be as open and honest to people as possible to become less of a confusing threat - and hope that atleast a few or someone will understand you despite the major differences and the risks they'll have to take (of being misunderstood, mistreated by someone who will never understand them or in worst case scenario actually being in a vulnerable relationship with someone who DOES lack empathy)\n\nThanks for coming to my TED talk._ Brilliant young man._ \"Am I really diseased if I think differently\" northkorea approves_ My 14 yr old sister has autism and this Video really helped me, her and no doubt a lot of people. Best ted talk I‚Äôve seen by far. Thankyou Ethan Lisi!!_ autism in my opinion and experience IS  a gift and i can even imagine myself without this disorder because i wouldn't be me._ I have autism, and so far I‚Äôve led a completely normal and uneventful life. Just my input_ You never actually studied Autism, have you?_ And your point being?_ What's your point?_ I went to high school with him, and he really is!_ @vanessamilton8235¬† Really? Can you tell us more?_ most of us autistics are actually fairly pleasant_ You‚Äôll find most people with an Autism diagnoses are some of the most kind hearted, caring individuals you‚Äôll come across._ i like your way of thinking :)_ Eu concordo. Cumprimentos de um autista de Portugal._ So you're saying we should \"cure\" Autism just because most people don't like it? Kind of like homophobia? Is that it?_ Respect to you my brother. You are a very cool person who will achieve great things in life!_ Good doctor ...actor just have watched him...he talks like him in it_ I have autism and I wouldn‚Äôt change it for the world. I taught myself french._ I love what he says at 7:07. It's really insightful and helpful for me as a neurotypical who works with individuals on the spectrum)._ I hate how he denies that all stereotypes are not valid but he then stereotypes other autistic people._ A woman in my family is diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome. I've talked to her about it and know that she is \"masking\" when I am visiting. Masking so well that I was genuinely surprised when she told me, I might add. She is also one of the most intelligent and kindest people I know, and I have never understood why anyone would regard her condition as a disorder. In fact, I think people like her are a treasure for our society that we should value dearly._ Saying autism is normal doesn't make it normal I mean he didn't really Express what autism is like. Just complaining doesn't make ppl more autism like_ Should I try to get a test if I feel like all these things apply to me?_ I can feel his genuine sweetness and it made me cry. My brother is the sweetest most content soul and I wish everyone could be like him._ On that note, tedtalks signature chime audio that plays at the beginning of every video makes me grate my teeth every time I hear it cause the high frequencies crawl into my ears. Yall can make a sound with the same effect + tones with the volume on those high frequencies turned lower._ I have Autism and I agree with you we are all different. I am a social butterfly_ I don‚Äôt know why this doesn‚Äôt have as much views. This is a MUST for everyone to watch_ Agreed, although everyone controls their emotions to become socially acceptable, Autistic people do so even more.  It's all emotions or nothing.  The world is more accepting of nothing, therefor the lack of empathy is a mask, then becomes normal._ Better to be autistic than an average preconceived racist jughead._ There are people with autism who live in care homes. Some can't speak. Some have full time carers. You can't generalise like this._ 2:51 Someone once said, \"Think different\". He said ‚ÄúHere's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.‚Äù That man was Steve Jobs and he thought differently and was proud of it. And his \"crazy\" and \"different\" thoughts changed the world. Or made a dent in the universe as he put it himself. And now we can¬¥t even imagine living without what he left behind. All because he was thinking differently._ I am almost 19 and think I have a bit of autism. Because I am really shy around big crowds, and nervous around women I find attractive or one I am talking to._ He looks like Cliff Burtom_ i dunno but it feels like this guy has been describing me for the past 10 minutes, except for the part of large parties, i love that_ Sure enough we are human and not a syndrome. As an Aspie, it is easy for me to agree. Well done with the public speaking by the way. \nThen again, I think of all the fellow autistic people who are not high-functioning, who cannot mask or only in a limited fashion. That is autism too. \nI mean, this story needs to be told and society would do well to open up to slightly different modes of perception but this is not the complete story._ Good job I taught myself Spanish_ Got autism I taught and still teaching myself Arabic which i have done for 8 years (c.4/15/2013) and Hebrew for 5 years (c.5/27/2016) & now I'm willing to teach myself Russian and what motivate me was from this wonderful human being named Tzita Golub -Cohen (1916-2012) in her memory_ @mikhailabunidal9146¬† cool_ Same_ Only French?_ @fllwurhrt¬† you doing better?_ @GetDarceChoked¬† no.

That doesn't count?_ Have you gotten a diagnosis?_ thats could either be social anxiety and or human nature. if you are curious i recommend talking to a gp :)_ alicia murch ok mabye I will_ I agree. He spends the whole talk \"debunking\" negative stereotypes for autists, while propping normality among only high functioning ones. At a certain point of the spectrum, the people who preside there are truly sick and need medication to function as a human._ At 5:04 Haha üòÇ the audience didn‚Äô grasp that_ The venue seems to be quite small for a Ted Talk. Why?_ We all do stimming in some sense or another and everyone is on a spectrum. Some more then others so they cant hide it or have a hard time at life_ A cure?! For autism?! Wat?_ He speaks like someone on LSD :)_ I know that this question is against the social norm, but where does he say why autism is or is not a  disease?\nIs there another part or source that I can not find?_ That last scene üòÇüòÇüòÇ_ Some are sensitive to outbursts of feelings expressed. Some are not.\nIn my opinion, 'masking' all the time is partly waste of time and comfort._ Is there a difference between an autist and an introvert?_ u know..for someone trying to tell people that autism isn't like the stereotype, he sure looks the part x'''D  n before u get offended, im also autistic :v_ That centuries old stupid human trait of be weirded out by someone or something different._ This is really informative, thank you!_ You look like Cliff Burton_ this guy fits perfectly into his own stereo type of what an autistic person is like (not saying all autistic people are like that, just saying he is)_ he do got nice hair._ We're all wired differently - VIVE LA DIFF√âRENCE!! :-)_ Living with 2 people with ASD I have found 2 simple facts\nEveryone with ASD is different and individual\nEveryone without ASD is different and individual\nI don't value social popularity much, having only found trouble when I had it.  I value intellect that comes form desire to learn.  I admire people who are willing to work through rather than hide behind them.  When my son received an ASD diagnosis, I relaised what I had wanted as a child and he was had a name.  I appreciate it, others often do but the less informed struggle._ Women also experience autism differently to men because we are socialised differently and face different pressures to fit in. Most young girls go un-diagnosed, and it's VERY expensive to get a diagnoses as an adult.\n\nThe research into autism in girls is still in its infancy because, for so long, it was understood that boys were more likely to have autism, but it was only because nobody was actually considering how autism affects young girls. It was only when female doctors started connecting the dots that the research began into female autism.\n\nJust think how many women out there have gone un-diagnosed for their entire lives and have struggled because of it? I know, because I'm one of them.\n\nI have lived my entire life feeling like a square peg in a round hole, and my family pointing and laughing at my quirks (they never meant anything by it, but it was always just a reminder to 'mask' better), and a reminder that I was different, and a bit weird, and needed to try to be more normal.\n\nTurns out there was a reason for it all along :-)._ mom, I fell in love with him_ The lucky ones are diagnosed and receive help with the moral support of a loving caring family and professionals. Autism isn't fun. There is a doorway into the real world. Trauma is not funny, especially if one has trouble dealing with the symptoms that put them there, in that state of mind of loneliness. Without much help. \n\nQuestion yourself, see yourself, believe in yourself, have confidence, and don't allow anyone to get you down for you know who you are inside. Fear no evil. Fear nothing but God Himself. Thank you America._ probably because he cant handle large crowds like he said_ Not everybody is on the spectrum you do realize neurotypical exist right? What kind of stupid crap did you got that from?_ Unknown User school_ @venus189¬† What school?_ Autism has more symptoms._ yes. not all people with autism are introverts. i know a few extroverts who are on the spectrum_ I couldn't get up on that stage and be that calm_ \"autistic people don't have empathy\"\n\"this is not true because I have empathy\" \n\nIf I wanted to reuse this bad argument:\nI know people who are autistic that are very empathetic but for example my brother or my boyfriend don't appear to feel the same kind of empathy as I do. It's more like logically concluding someone is distressed and then caring for them instead of just seeing and feeling it yourself._ one thing confuses me: \n\"we're not all socially awkward, have special interests/obsessions, don't have empathy... etc etc\" \n\"autism is not a disorder, we a re just different\" \n\nYou're right. Not all autistic people are socially awkward or interested in stuff like electronics, because that's something that's hard to be for people who are nonverbal and severly mentally handicapped. \nAutism isn't just HF-people. (high-functioning)\nIt's a spectrum and everyone is different. Just like all other people. \nAnd even for HF people: \nWe don't need to accomodate to everyone, but we do need more understanding. Don't clap when he says he can't stand loud noises. Try to look away if someone can't handle eye contact well. Educate school teachers. (which is what they are already doing here in Germany)_ Did this dude really say that autism shouldn't be considered a disease, and then listed a bunch of mundane things that \"overwhelm\" autists and make it hard for them to function normally in a society? Yeah, autists are people and deserve to be respected and accommodated in our society, and we should be more open and understanding of them. But autism is definitely a negative thing, a kind of a neurological disability, and I don't know how anybody can deny that._ I have a cousin who is autistic, and I always thought he was the coolest ! Funny dude. Sometimes he would have bursts of emotion. I understand now that‚Äôs just how he expresses himself and we shouldn‚Äôt try to restrict that._ If autism is a chemical difference in the brain, then we are all different. Some more common, some less. All 'normal'._ the world needs to stop canceling diseases....nowadays any mild neuro diseases are just dismissed by people as some sort of character quirks.... i have people in my family with severe autism....IT IS DISEASE! ..._ AMAZING talk._ We were able to decrease my sons sensitivity to noises with biomedical therapies, he went from non verbal to verbal after one week of bio. He does well on auto immune diets. \nWhat I‚Äôm trying to say is we don‚Äôt know what causes autism, their is no gene for it, but we do know that people are improving their autism symptoms and eliminating them in some cases with some basic interventions like healing the gut for example and dukes stem cell therapy trial to heal the brain damage. \n\n\nI‚Äôm not trying to change who my son is, just trying to make him more comfortable in his own body. He no longer bangs his head and says he remembers when he couldn‚Äôt talk, it was so hard for him._ And you just gave a great Ted Talk! <3 You're great and don't let anyone tell you otherwise :)_ God loves you and i do to_ Why do people think people with autism are sociopaths like wtf, we have so little information about different personalities that I am getting pissed about it üòë_ I cant stand loud noises, too_ Multiple concurrent conversations are the worst. Quarantine has been a godsend for me for my education, being able to focus on only my lecturer rather than the whispering I keep hearing, or the conversations in the hallways._ I don't know if I fall in the autism spectrum, I think probably not, but I have many of the same aversions.  Loud music, loud people, crowds, and disorganization in any environment.  I'm very empathetic to being very careful about saying the wrong thing and then being accused of being robotic.  I just hate making false or misleading statements to the point I'd rather be calculating._ It was a very interesting TED but let me point out something: I agree on that any mental disorder (where \"disorder\" means being just different than the majority of the population) isn't a disease as long as one's able to function as an adult by him/herself or with a little help. Autism spectrum disorders is very, very wide so autism has many faces._ What an incredible TED talk! I am proud of Ethan!_ Damn he looks like a random bassist from an 80s heavy metal band üòÅüëç_ Being autistic I cart say the idea of a ‚Äòcure‚Äô is bad_ I love his hair though_ Why do you see autism as a negative thing? Have you ever heard of Albert Einstein? Do you think his autism didn't help him in anyway? Do some more research, then come back._ @filipeflower¬† ok, I've done some research. It is just a speculation that Einstein had autism, and in the case that he did, I don't know how it would help him. As far as I know, autism is a condition that pretty much always puts obstacles in front of people - makes it harder to communicate with others, increases anxiety and inhibits learning._ @musicaccount3340¬† What research did you do? Show us your sources.\n\nAs for me, I'm autistic myself and still I managed to get a job and a girlfriend. So drop your generalist stereotype, ok? Autism is not a disease, but instead, it's a neurodiversity. That's why you can't find a cure for that._ @filipeflower¬† I just did a quick google search on what the consequences of autism are.\n\nOk, I'm happy for you. I don't know what stereotype you are talking about, I didn't say anything other than that autism is a negative influence on a vast majority of people that have it. I didn't say anything about a cure, or it being a disease. People with autism should be able to live normal lives and be integrated in our society, just like everyone else. But I don't understand how that makes autism not a negative._ @filipeflower¬† do you maybe mean that autism is a part of who people are, so it shouldn't be considered a negative, since that's their identity? I could see reason in that._ @musicaccount3340¬† Ok, I'm back. Yeah, that's part of the reason. Autism isn't necessarily bad. That depends on the people and the circumstances._ Can you give an example how burst of emotion looks like?_ It's more than that, actually, Try reading a propper book about it._ @filipeflower¬† Have done, thanks._ @pumpjackpiddlewick¬† So what are your conclusions so far?_ @filipeflower¬† that we do not understand very much, as yet. But more is being understood slowly. That personal experience does not yet really play a part in studies. That it is a super difficult topic to pigeon hole, as there are so many variations._ @pumpjackpiddlewick¬† I know. I happen to be autistic myself and still I managed to get a job._ @filipeflower¬† And your conclusions?_ @filipeflower¬† And your own conclusions?_ @pumpjackpiddlewick¬† I conclude that autism should not be looked down upon. Sure there are cases of autistic people who don't move very much and don't talk either, but there's also cases of autistic people who managed to succeed in life, like myself. In fact, you could say that autism is a neuro diversity._ @filipeflower¬† Totally agree. Myself, my partner and our respective families are all on the spectrum, in varying degrees. Some  more  successful than others,  though essentially all successful. I personally am fascinated by how all our brains work, how other factors influence as we are so diverse. Autism is fascinating, not, as you say, to be looked down upon. I do think, with time, there will be a recognition of how much autism has played in the shaping and nurturing of the world as we know it. I find myself inspired by the scope of the brains ability and diversity._ no its a DISORDER. dont be so disrespectful_ You're highly mis-informed if you think autism is a disease. Use Google or another trustworthy encyclopedia._ It isn't, please learn what a disease is._ Do you have any evidence to back up those claims of yours?_ Would someone answer this question for me? Why even label people like us as Autistic when we percieve life differently? Why label yourself as normal when normal repeats history over and over and never learns from its mistakes? Just saying, I thought that was insanity...._ Wow! I sure learned a lot about autism that I always wondered about.  Thank you for the enlightenment._ Thank you ‚ù§ Great speech :)_ This is amazing. One speech that changes the way i see austism... thank you_ Compassionate capacity is strongly linked to the construction of the personality (toxic or non-toxic family, much or little conditioning to violence, resilience and transcendence or violent stagnation,...). \nA person with an autistic neurological profile may have a highly developed compassion ...or may be psychopathic.\nThese are separate levels (even if we might find in the future possible correlations, for example, between neuro characteristics related to autism and more developed resilience capacities).\nAfter... the fact that an autistic person can't express his emotions (and therefore have weird feedback throughout his childhood) is rather a scary point. The social masks, the repressed emotions, the calculation of behaviours, etc., we know that all this produces rather psychic cleavage than fulfilment. So just saying that we function differently is not saying much.\nI'd like to hear from people with autism on that._ Fun fact: It‚Äôs often believed that more males are likely to have autism or Asperger‚Äôs than females. However, women are good at acting, covering up the symptoms. This can lead people to think it‚Äôs just a behavior problem, so many women are misdiagnosed or are diagnosed late._ never tested walk through a parking lot to get away from the noise of the road.

You still believe autism is a bad thing?_ Brooke1994 this is me. I‚Äôm a 41 year old female who functions in society. But this diagnosis would connect ALL my weird dots. My husband is convinced, but he actually appreciates it about me. It makes me, me ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  This videos motivated me to get diagnosed officially_ But if you are honest while diagnosed, how is it misdiagnosed?_ Yeah. I think that there is some degree of awareness spreading about how autism presents in females. I think that males struggle with the stigmatised overtness of their symptoms, while we tend to struggle with the strain of heavy internalisation. Be well, take care of yourselves üíôüíú_ @Nekotaku_TV¬† Don't quote me on this, but I believe that male autism tends to present more overtly, while females with autism are more likely to internalise symptoms. This means that the criteria for diagnosis tends to be based on the characteristics that were most easily observable (overt, therefore more male oriented). This means that females tend to fly under the radar long enough to hone the art of maintaining masks reflecting degrees of social acceptability, they may come to believe that their natures are something shameful, to be hidden (this can lead to misdiagnosis bcs they try to hide themselves, their \"true\" nature). There also tends to be a higher risk of co-morbid problems in females bcs of the strain of internalising and hiding yourself (depression, anxiety, eating disorders etc... may be treated as singular issues without the root cause of distress being discovered). Be well, take care üíôüíú_ Dont they also show different symptoms? We know of male autism better because the signs are more obvious and males tend to have more extremes, meaning the autism is extremely  noticeable. allowing us to narrow down by taking those behaviors and \"turning them down\" so we could see less extreme versions._ @naturesfinest2408¬† \nEvery individual has different symptoms to one another. We do see the diagnostic criteria is gender bias, at first the professionals thought only men could be Autistic. \n\nWhile the majority of Autistic males talk about particular subjects, the majority of females talk more about thoughts and feelings, with the remainder in the middle like myself.\n\nAs I've listened to Autistic people females say they think visually, but the men say they think more verbally, then again some males think visually and vice versa. \n\nThat's why it's harder to diagnose females, the criteria is based on the behaviour of Autistic men._ mhm..._ Similar story with ADHD women. Most of us get misdiagnosed with anxiety and depression first. Causes a lot of unnecessary suffering_ That depends on how well one can mask it, overcome the exhaustion from masking and being able to avoid people, no one noticed I was autistic until recently, I was diagnosed with severe autism at 60 years old and I am a male. So your fun fact is not a fact._ @Nekotaku_TV¬† misconceptions in the mental health fields will do that._ My best friend is a female and she has a Asperger‚Äôs. However she is very intelligent, and is a wonderful friend!_ @celticcheetah6371¬† I was misdiagnosed with ADD. Then years later I found out I had depression and anxiety!_ All wrong. It's simple genetics. X chromosome linked recessive conditions occur more often in in men. Men have one X chromosome. A recessive gene on that X chromosome will cause the condition. The Y chromosome is the other half of the XY gene pair in a man. The Y chromosome doesn't contain all of the genes of the X chromosome because one of the \"legs\" are missing. That means there can be no correction by the Y chromosome of a recessive gene on that part of the X chromosome..\nWomen have two X chromosomes and so would have to inherit the same recessive gene from each of her parents in order to have the condition.\n\nI've massively oversimplified that and I'm not claiming it describes the cause of autism. However, It is the explanation for why men are five times more likely to have dyslexia, colour-blindness and a few other conditions. That alone would lead to a perception that men are more likely to have autism. \n\nIf you do get to the point of looking at the evidence and basing your opinion on it and not the other way around you will no doubt agree that men are about five times more likely to be on the spectrum. The above simplified explanation is the one you should research. Not the ideologically driven one._ Females are at a higher risk for Rhett's syndrome. It's not underdiagnosed in girls, it's simply less common._ @platosocrates9350¬† Think we're in one of those \"feelings over facts\" threads_ @columbasaint465¬† We are. It's quite ironic really. The autism crowd that claims they're much more cold and logical has a temper tantrum when they aren't told what they want to hear._ @Danny-jl2sd¬† Prove it_ @columbasaint465¬† How exactly do you expect that user to prove that?_ @filipeflower¬† I don't know what is the worse reflection upon the state of humanity; The fact you don't understand what evidence is or the fact you don't seem to think it matters._ @columbasaint465¬† You didn't answer my question._ @filipeflower¬† correct_ @columbasaint465¬† Also, don't make assumptions about me when you don't know who I am._ @nova00boss I feel your frustration. It's actually worse when you are in a high responsibility position and have respect in that area of your life only to have an \"otherworld\" experience every time you are dealing with a new group of people that severely underestimate you. I tend to think it's projection on their part. \nMy only advice is not to start to think you are a victim. It's not a good mindset.\nComing out with things like \n\n\"Suicide rates are much higher for autistic people than for neuro-typicals. And especially high for female autistic people (4,7 times the rate of neuro-typical women)\"\n\nIs only going to make things worse. For a start have you any idea the rate of suicide in men vs women? \nDon't play gender politics. It's for stupid people with agendas that want to be victims._ @filipeflower¬† I'll do as I please and ignore your demands child._ @columbasaint465¬† There. You just did it again. Also, it's hypocritical of you to demand proof when you failed to do the same thing yourself. This isn't a court room, you know._ @nova00boss Congratulations for you. I hope you have a good life from now on. Take care._ @filipeflower¬† I didn't demand anything. Go have a tantrum somewhere else. I don't care._ @columbasaint465¬†  Yes, you did. The fact that you said \"prove it\" counts as a demand. Don't try to excuse yourself out of this one. Also, if you don't care, why did you come back anyway?_ @columbasaint465¬† \nLook on sites or read books by professionals, they'll inform you gender effects how someone on The Autism Spectrum is affected.\n\nThen if you want more, listen to autistic people share their life experiences and explain how they're effected, you'll see differences between males and females._ @columbasaint465¬† \nIf you go reading through comment sections you are going to find things like suicide rates mentioned and that doesn't mean the person is playing victim, I mention the suicide rates to some people depending what we're discussing but I'm never playing \"autism makes me a victim\".\n\nOther autistic people and I speak on behalf of those who are not able, share what people could do to help them.\nMe for example, I inform parents if their children can't understand what they're saying try and be more specific, straight forward, avoid using unverbal communication and if necessary slow their voice down.\n\nOthers who have children with their physical senses heightened or reduced, I inform the parents it's a reaction to overstimulation so reduce the stimulants in the home.\n\nI inform them meltdowns are not immediate reactions, they are built up so I advise them to watch for signs in their children.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSome people refuse to accept our advice to help their children increase neurodevelopmental progression and wellbeing, when they do so I inform them of the consequences like their child will live an exhausting, depressing, stressful life by masking causing mental health issues. And that it's found the masking increases the probability of suicidal thoughts during adulthood through thwarted belonging.\n\nThat's not I playing the victim, it's I sharing the possible consequences of their selfishness thinking their children must make every evolve around their expectations. Inform them that some things that are good for nonautistic people are bad for autistic people due to the variation in cognitive functioning._ perplexing but just wants me to give love and support. üî•üî•_ @columbasaint465¬† The only thing is that they have not proven a passable \"gene\" that causes autism. Though if one child has it future children are more likely to as well, the cause of autism has never been found and no good basis or link definitely prove it's something passed through recessive traits._ As a girl diagnosed at 20, yes_ Beautiful!! üî•üî•üî•_ @Nekotaku_TV¬† a lot of doctors straight up won‚Äôt diagnose autism. They‚Äôll call it adhd because of the stigma and they think being diagnosed with autism is bad for the patient_ I was diagnosed at age 7. My parents noticed that I wasn't making any eye contact at 6 weeks, and as I got older I did all kinds of abnormal things like attacking my dad for singing. Since my mom was a doctor it helped her to connect the dots and get someone to diagnose me.¬† \n23 years later, I still have trouble with eye contact!_ I think that there is a gap it methods of detecting autism in females due to societal prejudice. As the knowledge grows hopefully the skills required will be gained. I am male and have masked for nearly 50 years to the point where my closest people are having a difficult time accepting it._ I was diagnosed at 18._ Yes, My husband and I have Autism, diagnosed late. His social behaviours were never questioned,  yet from a young age I was told \"dont do that,\" \"do this,\" \"people dont like GIRLS who do that,\" \"GIRLS have to be like this.\" I never agreed, as to why, but I would get punished for not being normal (yes I was hit, missed out on things, or even rejected)._ @savai646¬† I was diagnosed with OCD, Depression, Sensory Disorder, Eating Disorder, Social Anxiety and Fear of Failure. I was a quiet kid, and followed routine and rules. I was polite, and always did my work. I had people praising me for being well behaved, and tidy looking. Basically society likes a quiet, clean, obedient girl. I was also a good looking blonde girl, so I think that had a thing to do with being undiagnosed too. Now that Im older (and not conventionally pretty) people are starting to say I have to grow up and start acting like an adult._ A lot of women don't cover it up at all, and are in fact very clearly autistic in all the exact same ways as men, but NT people misinterpret their behaviour and attribute intent based on their weird imagination that they think makes them psychic._ @danielmoore4024¬† \"read books by professionals\" but only the ones that confirm your theories.

Try reading it._ @mydogeatspuke¬† I already tried that. But it's not clear enough. That's why I'm asking for a more precise explanation._ @filipeflower¬† there isn't one. I said what I meant. If you can't understand basic English, there are things called schools you can attend._ @mydogeatspuke¬† I've already been to multiple schools, but that still doesn't explain the true meaning behind your words. Also, if I couldn't understand basic English, we wouldn't even be communicating with each other._ @filipeflower¬† I already told you that what I said was what I meant. There is no \"true meaning\" I'm refusing to share. Take yer meds._ @mydogeatspuke¬† FYI, I already did that. But how is that related to this?_ YourRationalWorldisaCircleJerk¬† What claim?_ I was diagnosed late.\nI'm 21 and I was diagnosed with autism in February this year._ @meganblomfield2558¬† Good luck on your journey.

You don't even know Sara Rocha, do you?_ @idontcare2851¬† What cult are you refferring to?_ @idontcare2851¬† Define cult._ @idontcare2851¬† How about you share your sources, if you have any?_ @idontcare2851¬† Your definition for autism and some valid source that explains what a cult is. It doesn't look like you know what you're talking about. You're not a scientist, are you?_ @idontcare2851¬† Anything else?_ @idontcare2851¬†\nEverything I wrote is confirmed by autism researchers and biologists.\nNeurodiversity is scientific, how on earth can you make the claim all brains are identical?\nNeurodiversity is diversity in neurological development, for you to deny neurodiversity, you're denying the undeniable fact that there's diversity between all brains._ @danielmoore4024¬† That Idont Care user is nothing but an anti-autism troll. Not worth our time, apparently._ @danielmoore4024¬† you claimed that men and women present and experience autism differently, and that this claim is backed up by \"autism researchers and biologists.\" I'm not quite sure what a biologist would be doing looking at a neurodevelopmental disorder since there is no overlap in the fields, but anyone doing research would do well to speak with more than just those who confirm their biases. I am female, woman, sane, almost 40. I was diagnosed in my 30s. I scored 49 on the AQ50 (I believe the only one I didn't get a mark on was about teeth feeling strange in the morning, because I've always had poor dental hygiene and so my teeth always feel exactly the same), and scored very high/low on the sensory profile, way outside of averages. After roughly 8 hours of assessment with a clinical psychologist (none of which involved my family as some claim is necessary for assessment, which would exclude those like me who either do not have or are estranged from family) and another 40 or so with an occupational therapist, I was diagnosed. I always had all of the classic \"male brain\" symptoms, have always been \"obsessive\" and \"obtuse,\" struggle to \"let things go,\" \"cold and uncaring,\" \"robotic,\" etc. All things used to describe the \"male presentation\" of autism. I have never masked, never been able to lie to do so. Never wanted to lie, in fact I'm a chronic, compulsive truth teller. It's got me into a lot of trouble over the years. The problem with the Internet and social media at large is that anyone can diagnose themselves with anything by just watching a 20 second clip. The idea that someone could so convincingly \"mask\" their symptoms of autism that even those closest to them would struggle to accept a diagnosis is laughable. So many people live in a fantasy world, and so many doctors are easily mislead by manipulative people who've spend countless hours practicing how to \"properly\" answer questions and managed to delude themselves into believing this diagnosis is correct. Just like with all the \"DID\" patients in recent years. Many of whom btw have never experienced the kind of trauma necessary for that make believe disorder to manifest in the first place. At least with BPD you didn't need to be a Victim with a capital V, but that comes with so many negative stereotypes now that nobody wants the label anymore. A brain doesn't need to be identical, but official diagnostic criteria exist for a reason. All these \"autistic girls\" lists of perfectly normal human traits that have nothing at all to do with autism need to die in a fire. Alongside self diagnosis. Ridiculous._ @idontcare2851¬† it's not just the cult of self diagnosed \"neurodiversity\" that do it. Most people with any kind of belief will favour \"evidence\" that confirms their belief and disregard anything that is critical of it as fringe or conspiracy. That's just what stupid people do, and most people are stupid. Some medical \"science\" (presumably you're talking about psychology as neurodevelopmental disorders generally fall under that umbrella, which is hardly a science, since it wasn't that long ago that doctors agreed women with a whole host of issues that would merit their own diagnoses now were hysterical because of a wandering, dehydrated uterus) is utterly bonkers and shouldn't be taken seriously, and doctors are people so they do still get things wrong and make mistakes. To think otherwise would be very naive. But yes, most groups that screech the same platitudes are no better and often demonstrably wrong in their beliefs. But they won't ever listen to sense._ @mydogeatspuke¬†\nAutism is primarily genetic, are you going to now tell me genes are not biological?\nThey know with surety autism affects male and females variously, are you now going to tell me gender is not biological?\nAre you going to keep telling me the brain and nervous system have nothing to do with human biology? \nAre you going to tell me the biological approach in psychology is not biological even though it's called biopsychology? \n\nYou clearly don't know what biology is according to what you've written, and you talk about being bias making you a hypocrite that you make the claim human biology has nothing to do with biology. \n\nThere's overwhelming evidence through observance that gender is a variable, females being diagnosed at a later age compared to males is just one. One of the multiple reasons females are diagnosed later is because they are better at hiding their autism, numerous females have to have as many as 5 assessments before they receive an official diagnosis because during the assessment they hid their autism that the doctors couldn't see it.\n\nPerhaps you should read what I write before you respond, I quote;\n\"the majority of females\" \n\nMajority does not equal all females, so you're not very truthful considering how manipulative and misleading you are. \n\nWatch a Ted talk called \"Copy and Paste\" by an autistic girl._ Me. Recently diagnosed at 35. As are all 3 of my kids. 1 of those also have adhd like me. We are all different, yet similar._ @mydogeatspuke¬† Try reading articles written by Sara Rocha, the president of APVA. That might teach you something new._ @filipeflower¬† the personal opinions of a woman who used to lead a now defunct Portuguese non profit? Those aren't articles to learn from, they're diary entries._ @mydogeatspuke¬† Correction. Those aren't just personal opinions. She has facts as well (with scientific evidence). If you actually bothered to read more, you would have known that too._ @filipeflower¬† why would I bother to read more of someone's diary? They should be private. Also, someone making any kind of claim that anything is a fact, scientific or otherwise, when I have personally experienced the contrary immediately makes them an unreliable source, because what they're saying can't be a fact if I have personally experienced the contrary. So. Thanks, but no thanks._ @mydogeatspuke¬† Can you please specify what exactly have you been reading? Because I didn't say anything about a diary. I don't think you read the exact same thing I already did._ @filipeflower¬† or you could just accept my answer of \"no,\" and move on with your life? You already came back to a reply that was TWO YEARS AGO to carry this on. You clearly have problems, and they're nothing to do with me._ @mydogeatspuke¬† 1- I accept that you don't want to read what Sara's association publicized, but I don't accept you denial as evidence. You didn't prove anything.\n\n2- Two years ago doesn't stop anyone from replying back, just like it didn't stop those other people who replied to 12 year old comments of mine. There's not even a rule against that, so you've not no point there.\n\n3- Everyone has problems, not just autistic people.

That's literally impossible. Some may have signs but that doesn't mean you have autism. Autism is a complete developmental disability. We don't all have that. Also, it's extremely disrespectful to the people who spend their life trying to get a diagnosis. Being autistic isn't fun or cute by the way. It fucking sucks._ @sgeggbub1008¬† NO, not everyone has autism_ alicia murch imagine a triangle. One corner is non autism, another is high functioning, and the last is low functioning. Everyone is a dot placed somewhere within that triangle whether they be towards the corners of autism or all the way in the non autism corner. That kind of triangle can display where everyone is, autistic or the complete opposite.

I tried to hush the audience..._ @jynx1891¬†hi autistic person here- I love your comment because it shows that you value our experiences, so I wanted to let you know that the term for non-autistic people is allistic. The word for people whose brains are generally socially acceptable in how they function is neurotypical, abbreviated NT. I am sharing this information not to subtract from your comment and the positive intention behind it, I am not offended by your use of the word normal, I just think words are important and have an impact on how we view the world and others, and the terms normal and the inverse abnormal can hold unconscious biases that can result in othering those deemed outside the norm. Apologies for the long comment, I know that NT & allistic people can see the sharing of information as a negative correction so I must be verbose to attempt to avoid being misconstrued. Have a nice day fellow human :)_ Congrats. I fell in love with my hubby because he was different. 20 years together. 16 and 13 year old sons. Both autistic. Proud Mom and Wife._ Series like atypical potray autism in so a wrong way,like everyone who has autism screams,is not empathetic etc,truth is,i met three people who have autism and even became good friend with on of them and they were all affected by it in a similar but totaly different way.For the other one humans were a big problems and he hated everyone,the other one only disliked them but could co exist with them,they both had visual problems,they couldnt look someone straight in the eye,loud noises werent good too.The last one,a woman,she couldnt understand social rules and had bad experience because of it,acted very very dumb often,even though she wasnt stupid.the good friend of mine who has autism,well i would say this:He is defined by it in many ways,but he also is just himself,i saw him as a normal guy with problems like everyone else.The only different is,we gave his problem a name,i have seen acting people strange all my life and they are labbeled as healthy ._ seriously i think nonautistic people can be more weird sometimes and have less empathy_ This form of discrimination is a bit similar to what started racism \nAnd I hope it fades away faster and quieter than racism has_ \"My inner feelings are unlimited, but my mind only lets me express extremes or nothing.\" That one line reveals a great deal for those of us with autism._ Autism is a mental condition, but it's not a disease.  There is no cure._ I am Autistic and I had an Autistic friend who saved my life._ I certainly don't think this young man needs to be \"cured\" of anything, he's perfect just the way he is.  But before universally condemning people who search for a cure, remember that a lot of people with more severe, low functioning autism are living very different lives.  Many are completely nonverbal, and will never be able to live independently.  If you're a parent of a child that cannot speak at all, or use a bathroom without help, searching for a cure is a noble pursuit._ ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è_ 5:10 that's because doing your homework at night IS very tiring. In fact i don't think the time of day really matters_ I have Asperger syndrome, and I have to say that this man right here put into words what I couldn't even think in my head._ I think that people who can handle loud noises have serious problems‚Ä¶ ( hearing problems, for sure)_ good job, one note though, there ARE youtubers out there ( families with A.S.D.) who gratefully share their world with the \"neurotypical \" population such as \"the Wee family\", \"FATHERING AUTISM\" and\n \"BEING DUSTY-MAE\", just the ones I know of, PS: I am on the spectrum too :-)_ As an autistic man, I couldn't be happier that this video exists as many don't see autism for what it is, a disorder that gives you a different view of the world. Most instead view it as a horrid disease that must be cured, something that makes you weird and alien when that straight up isn't the case. I'm a perfectly normal human just like everyone else and hope more people can finally get to see that and that I no longer feel like I have to hide my condition to people until they actually get to know me._ Best wishes_ 6:00 That's fine though! A lot of other people are struggling with that too! ^^'_ Well done - thank you for helping me understand better._ Autistics tend to be very good at getting down to the bits and bolts of things they're interested in. As I've witnessed over and over again with my sister who is autistic. We need them in society._ Hurry, someone share this to 4chanü§£ü§£_ Angels are smiling_ I appreciate this and it's good to have insight from the perspective of one who is dealing with it, but some of this is inaccurate.\nE.g. For some autistic people, difficulty with empathy is absolutely a symptom.\nMy roommate is autistic and we're both learn more about it as time goes on. He's a unique guy. Just like no two people's minds are the same, neither are the minds of those who deal with autism._ Your point? If we can accept people with different races and different sexual orientation in various societies, why not the same for autism? We need to inform ourselves about this._ Yeah, that‚Äôs another huge misconception, that we don‚Äôt feel empathy and experience emotions, but unless an Autistic Person is also a Psychopath, this is lightyears away from being true. \nWe struggle to express our emotions and empathy because of our social skills and abilities developing more slowly._ Yes, just yes, mate_ That sentence is amazingly true_ @arthurfleck629¬† That's true as well and i can confirm because im also Autistic. ill use this for an example. I never was able to talk until i was 5 because my Autism delayed my Mental Development until i was 14 and i still can't express my emotions well and my social skills are still a little bad but my physical abilities are as far as i can tell are normal as of now i only started to learn how to use my limbs a little when i was 8 but one thing is true in my case which is that i don't feel empathy which affects my social skills greatly and my abilities are still developing slow as of 2021._ My brother is this way too‚Ä¶ If we are having a serious conversation he might not say anything. He might even close his eyes and pretend to be asleep. \n\nBut, after we part ways he will write down all of his feelings and send them to me. And boy, he feels a lot.  He just communicates it differently._ I get this._ @ImSimplyAHuman¬† \nIf your brother's not aware, look up and show him \"The Double Empathy Problem\".\nExperimental research shows it's a two directional problem, just like autistic people can struggle to read nonautistic people, nonautistic people struggle to read autistic people._ Jesus Christ, that's so me.\n\nWhen I'm not expressing normal and friendly emotions to normal and friendly interactions with my family or school friends (back before covid), I`m actually very stoic, especially when I`m being reprimanded, or that I see annoying stimuli or emotions from other people and such; even when I`m feeling pretty down or pessimistic or depressed; barely showing a thing; not that I have to in this contexts anyway, therefore I don't\n\nThere's a lot of passionate thoughts inside my head to entertain me at my lonesome and to combat my boredom, and they're not ever expressed or hinted at by an unintentional quirk on my face, unless it's smth funny, to which I smirk uncaring of how spontaneous that might be for those around me, although I never really go out enough for that to have a problem for strangers outside my house\n\nI'm very good with perfectly acting like a neurotype when interacting with clientele service at shops when I (have to) buy things (that my parents need for them to do smth with me like a renovation project inside our house, since they actually do a bunch of it, honestly speaking) in town, and I am SUPER PROUD of that level of masking, emotionally control, autonomy and functioning, for some reason; I'm saying \"please\", \"thank you\", and smile and everything, never coming off as abrasive or insensitive, always picking on all the cues that they show, even if I've really dealt with people that had more to say to me than \"that'll be 64.59$ pls\" like a robot, and thus barely require to convey anything else (that said, I am absolutely SURE that I can pick on anything EASY PEASY)_ Maybe because my parents constantly think that I'm not good enough to live by myself, probably because they don't see me having any consistency in handling my routines and hobbies by myself, and that I never have \"real ones\" with other people, and that I need to socialize in order to be more autonomous or happier, or smth.\n\n\n\nAnyway, they don't non-verbally communicate, with this special kind of trust required for it to believable,, or smth like that, that they think that I'll ever be able to live on my own one day, or to be the normal person they think I can achieve, despite the autism (which they apparently seem & claim to understand and notice while seemingly not, like how I've just explained).\nIn short, all of these little remarks of a reprimand are actually demotivating & disappointing me, IMO, from doing much, and I'm looking forward to moving out into an apartment for university to grow with no judgment, and teach myself to rely on myself with a more comfortable & adapted pressure that I desire. I've tried telling them this, essentially, and to let me follow my own instincts into following the routines I need to take all by myself, but it's never amounted to anything meaningful. Nothing fundamentally changed.\n\n\n\n\nSeriously, those parents of mine really seemed involved, and they certainly have done the basics for my nutrition and my special educational needs, since I have lactose & gluten intolerances and now need an additional third of the usual time alloted in order to complete written exams (as well as math and physics, since even though I love - exploring - those fields - on my own free time -, I have a problem pacing my writing of the solutions).\nHowever, although they have given me some tutors or smth when I was a kid, and sent me to some clinic once or twice later in my teenagehood, AND have \"read some books\" that are still in the house, yeah, as I've said, they don't seem to truly want to try to give me a shot at governing myself as I see it, they still want to control that discipline FOR me in depriving me of little things like putting headphones in my ears and listening to what I want while I interact or help with them, although that aspect truly doesn't affect me negatively, in the grand scheme of things; I know how to polite around strangers and those that I have a responsibility towards, like my jobs' bosses, and although I have difficulty maintaining the 2 part-time jobs I've had, which were not just mere cashier jobs which I think would be ableist and below me, I never did smth like \"wearing headphones when talking to them\", figuratively speaking.\n\n\nAnd they haven't given me any therapist to talk to, which they can afford (they've spent money on me, although I don't know which amount, I know that their care for my development is enough if it is a competent and useful service; they are PRISTINELY mature & competent with their economy, lifestyle, expenses, attitudes, opinions, etc... Not disabled or insecure about anything ever, and both perfect drivers).\n\n\nAnd from what I've heard from them explicitly/head-on to me, it's like they think that I'm too old (on the verge of 20) to be supported in such things; so apparently, I'm not autistic enough, or they can't \"afford\" to see me as that kind of autsit anymore, if I ever want to grow up normally, or smth ?\n\n(Btw, I have absolutely no friends that I keep in touch with btw, smth they haven't made sure to properly monitor and help me with or keep a close eye on, probably for this reason; I had real friends in primary school - I live in Quebec, Canada, right next to Montreal -, transferred to a private secondary school for the better educations standards, since my parents, again, cared about my proper development, where I only had friendly relations with others at best, and neutral/non-existent at worst, and in CEGEP it was barely anyone else, barring 2-3 exceptions, and other than those who got in the same CEGEP as me after secondary school and who aren't there anymore since I took the special needs feature of an additional year on my program in order complete all courses).\n\n\nAnd yet, at the same time, they're hands on with my personal autonomy and routines, with no indication of what they think'll happen once I move out to university (probably from a lack of asking, but still), which I don't think should be the case if they're not willing to do as much (which isn't too intrusive anyway) for the very, very clear emotions of self-disappointment and self-pity and self-loathing that I express whenever I am berated, which only ever happens when I keep repeating the same indicative mistakes of a very lack of autonomy & sense of routine !!!\n\n\nThis is gnawing at me, this lack of being listened to at least feels like it's their fault, and that feeling doesn't go away no matter what they're trying to tell me, which is always te same thing, fundamentally, whenever they berate me. It's always the same points, presented in the same way and same tone, and for a year there's like a significant, 2-digit percentage of chance that they'll end it announcing that \"they don't know what to say anymore\" because they're despairing to the fact that they can't say anything new, and that the old doesn't work anymore to motivate me to \"take responsibility\", which is always an insult to anyone to whom it is addressed, whether correctly or not, and thus really just inflicts torture on those poor folks, EXPECTING them to change out of a sort of punishment system, where the punishment is know to be very weak and ineffective.\nLike, uh, Idk, MAYBE HIRE A THERAPIST , at this point ??? C'mon, I'm almost at university an the situation is not reassuring. And btw, that professional will probably tell them, from his/her/their position of reality, that what they're doing can't work, and that even if they don't have anything better to do than that, that to not say anything when you should, in this situation, IS ultimately the better thing to do...\nI mean, it's like the principle behind free markets, and why central planning fails and makes the people suffer, right ? Fucking mental and wicked, I'm telling you..._ In the past a lot of people told me that I was very even-keeled.  Nothing seemed to bother me.  But in recent years my \"mask\" has been slipping, and I started expressing anger whenever it would come up.  At first I seemed to have no control over it, and it would practically explode out of me, just like Ethan mentioned.  I was very much aware that it was (usually) inappropriate tor the situation, so I had to learn to pause first, take a few breaths, consider how to speak my mind.  Sometimes it's like trying to rein in a wild horse, lol._ @ClearTheRubble7¬† Reminds me of something I heard Dr. Tony Attwood say in one of his videos discussing emotional regulation. He said neurotypicals regulate emotions on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being barely registering while 10 was highly emotive. Aspies on the other hand operate on a scale of 1,2,3,8,9,10! We tend to lack the middle ground. Speaking for myself, this seems to be true for both negative emotions and positive emotions. When I'm moved by something, when I'm excited about something it's like a wave washing over me. I'm at the extreme before I'm aware of it coming._ @jonmars9559¬† Yes--the positive emotions, too.  And sadness....  I usually try to avoid letting it show in public (lately not so much), but I'll often see or hear a sad story that will turn my eyes into a sprinkler system._ @ClearTheRubble7¬† I think that's why so many people on the spectrum appear to be emotionless or present themselves with 'flat affect'. It's safer to keep emotions under wraps rather than risk the embarrassment of over expressing emotions in public._ Yes, very true. My son is 15yo and I struggle with where he will fit in as a young adult and older. I‚Äôm very hopeful though that as the world changes, that it includes space for persons with ASD to strive and live and prosper._ @sasziy375¬† That is a really tough call. To some degree, it might depend on how well your son is able to manage his autistic traits. I do struggle on this particular topic.\nI struggled terribly in my teens and continued to struggle throughout life to fit in. I was 55 when I discovered I was on the spectrum and the ASD world has changed a great deal since I was your son's age. \nI think it would have been good to have known the reason I was different at an early age but at the same time I wonder if that would have created a different set of difficulties? I had to work hard to find ways to appear typical, observing and masking and mimicking others but I also was able to focus on special skills that benefitted me in terms of work. Doing that put me under a great deal of stress and caused me lifelong psychological problems but I never expected the world to change to accommodate me. I wonder sometimes whether knowing I was autistic at an early age would have been a benefit or a crutch? I'll never have the answer to that but I would suggest that your son will have self esteem difficulties if he can't use his knowledge of his ASD to effectively overcome the neurotypical landscape. No matter how much education the public has regarding ASD, don't expect a great deal of compassion or even wish for it. Your son has strengths to develop. As his parent, maybe it's best to make sure he focus' on his strengths more than manage his weaknesses? He's going to have to have the strength to negotiate in the neurotypical landscape of life, whatever it takes. If he's really good at a particular skill, others will give him his due. He will have greater self esteem and valuable skillsets to make his living. These are just my thoughts. He's lucky to have a mother that is so aware and supportive._ @jonmars9559¬† Thank you so much for your response. Everything you said is true. I‚Äôll have my son read your response and also listen to the talk. He is high functioning however, he worries sometimes about making things right for everyone and often compensates by taking the blame. I talk with him about this and assure him that it‚Äôs always better to tell the truth. However, my community, does recognize his social differences and this causes anxiety for me more than him. I‚Äôm still learning and that is why I appreciate your comment very much. Best regards._ @nicholasleclerc1583¬† I just want to say. i hear you and I sympathize with you. You just want full autonomy over your daily routines so you can be independent. Sending g lots of love your way_ Damn this is perfect. I‚Äôve never been able to express the feeling of just not being able to talk._ that should be on a t-shirt_ This explains so much of my troubles. Oh my god. Always, I've felt  a sense of 'all or nothing' when it comes to almost everything. I didn't know that was an autistic trait too.\n\nBy the way,I am always seen as different, because of my autism, but the thing is, autism is the default for me. I have no clue what happens in neurotypical brains, because I've never experienced it. Like, what do they think about all day? Why do they not get super exited for things, like I do? What's it like, having eye contact all of the time? How do you know when it's your turn to speak? \n\nAnd please stop assuming people with autism are dumb. Don't talk to us like we're kids. If you ask me, one of the worst parts about autism is how people treat you, incorrectly, because of your autism._ @Yes_this_is_my_cat¬† \nThose of us Autistic are near the two extremes in just about all aspects, not just emotions. Look at your abilities and difficulties, I bet what you're good at you're closer to 10 than others but what you find difficult you're closer to 1.\n\nAutism is like some trade condition, it sacrifices so much of one skill to increase another. Say intellectual ability and memory, most people would have 5:5, but autistics will have a trade, give up three intellectual ability for an increase of three in memory making it 2:8.\n\nAutism puts us closer to both ideals while NTs remain in the middle in denial of the two ideals._ I'm always trying to understand my son better and this line is one I will keep in the forefront of my mind._ I am always catching myself bursting out laughing at something in public or responding with a burst._ Keep it quiet and be ignored. Let it out and be shamed. pick one and do it all the time, otherwise people think there's something wrong. It's not easy._ @richard1311¬† I tend to express myself more freely with those I trust will understand. With others I continue to filter and mask the extremes of my thoughts and feelings. I can't expect too much of NTs._ @jonmars9559¬† Generally, I find people I do not know very well easier to open up to; there is little impact because the relationship isn't particularly valued to me. However, people I know well, I maintain a mask because they have come to expect certain behaviours in prolonged interaction. You can't get to know someone without maintaining a set of behaviours for a while, and letting my feelings out constantly is difficult for other people to handle without getting offended. SO I hide everything from most people._ So true._ Absolutely. It's one of the reasons why I also tell people why I hate dealing with conflict. Because no matter how hard I try I seem to only be all or nothing. And I don't want to be emotional or overreact but I can't seem to help it. Even if I can tell myself in my mind that dealing with the situation in front of me is not that serious the aspe t of handling confrontation seems to trigger my brain into overdrive. So I have to figure out a way to reframe for myself what constitutes \"conflict\" vs. Discussion or dialectic. It's a work in progress but it has been helping._ @ImSimplyAHuman¬† this is honestly a really good idea. Which I think I want to adopt and haven't thought about before._ @chickensandwich8808¬† I'm completely with you on this one. Confrontations and conflicts are all or nothing for me too. As a child that had no support for my differences and I was often the target of bullies at school. Unfortunately, there was never ending family conflicts at home as well. There was no escape except to disappear into the canyons around my neighborhood and hide out after school until I had to go home. It seemed there was conflict everywhere I went and if I couldn't avoid it, if I couldn't just weather it, I went Kaa Boom! I handle things better now but still tend to isolate and come out only when ready._ I‚Äôve been get bullied since I started school, even before I got diagnosed with autism and I don‚Äôt think it will ever stop because no one listens to me._ @Cupcake_2708¬† Don't know how old you are or how long you've had to endure such punishment but it's not your fault. This is abuse and this brings trauma. I had the same experience in school and unfortunately there was no one with any authority that could help me and there was nobody at home I dared bother with my problems. Being autistic is something certain bullies seem to be able to spot a mile away. They know we're different, they know we're sensitive and they know we're vulnerable. They delight in torturing us. Don't put up with it. In my day, which was a long time ago, I learned to fight back and by middle school people stopped targeting me. It's still left scars that will never leave me. Get help, you can't put up with this. Get to a safe place no matter what. What being bullied does to a person with autism's self esteem is agony and it can last a lifetime. Bullies want you to think you are nothing. You're someone and you are probably a lot better person than they are. Be careful._ @Cupcake_2708¬† How are you doing?_ @jonmars9559¬† bit better, you just listing to my problems helped. Though people around me still don‚Äôt listen to me, it good to know that other people will. I guess that‚Äôs why the internet is so greatüòä_ @Cupcake_2708¬† I'm hearing you. Still don't know how old you are. If you are in school and you are being bullied, psychologically or physically, it has to stop. I know that can be complicated but so are the ever lasting scars if it doesn't stop. There's got to be someone you can explain your situation to that can get you away from those that willfully abuse you. \nYou mentioned your appreciation for the internet. I recently read some excerpts from an interview with Elon Musk. Elon has Asperger's Syndrome and like most of us with Asperger's, his childhood was less than pleasant. We Aspies can't read people the way other people intuitively can, which makes socializing for us extremely difficult. Most of us want to connect with others, want to talk about things but we don't know the secret to fluent conversation. We miss what others pick up. We can learn these things but it's not easy. Elon shied away from socializing and instead pursued his special interests. For instance he loved computer programming and as a young teen would stay up all night and program. He got very good at it. He loved to read. He says he was always a seeker of truth and pursued physics, philosophy, world religions. He filled his mind with the things that mattered to him. He wanted to do great things. He couldn't get very far socially so he didn't make that a priority. I think that's the way for us Aspies. Find your safe place and pursue your interests with passion. In such a way, you may find other people with similar passions and those are the people that you are more likely to connect with. Some of the greatest achievements of mankind have been made by Aspies pursuing their passions. From Mozart to Albert Einstein, don't worry about what you can't do. Instead, pursue what you can do with passion. \nLet me know how things are going._ the classic \"was reading this when\" comment, it feels weird... and good._ I do often find myself bursting out laughing at work while sometimes bursting into song while on the job and no one shuns me for it._ I do show emotion but usually when I do turn off my emotions I‚Äôm usually in deep throught or deep concentration or having a panic attack I do sometimes dont ( it depends I can or can‚Äôt show emotions mostly just one if I‚Äôm lucky and if I do I can only use energy to show one emotion while the others are off) does that make sense?_ This is why we are outcasted from society._ @jonmars9559¬†\nThere's multiple reasons why autistic people seem emotionless and so blank faced.\n\nFirst about 20% of people on the spectrum are also diagnosed with Alexithymia.\nThe autistic brain has an enhanced consistency in logical thinking, so they try to make logical sense out of emotional situations. \nSome want to please others but don't know how others want them to feel.\nAnd some individuals on the spectrum do have a difficulty showing and identifying emotions depending on their brain development._ So very true. Grabbing this quote to keep._ That's such a great way of putting it.. I always feel like I'm bursting inside with emotion but never know how to express anything.. I've had girlfriends leave me because I have no idea how to express my love for anyone.. Ive only found out in the last few months that I'm on the spectrum.. If only I knew years ago what was \"wrong\" with me.. But years ago \"being autistic\" was a stigma that no one wanted to own up to.. I was born with Klinefelters syndrome which compounds things..._ This helps me understand my wonderful grandsons so much better. Thank you._ @shaneluck2570¬† Thank Ethan Lisi. I only quoted him._ Autistic gang üí™_ That‚Äôs SO TRUE for me!_ Jon Mars\nAt least you had the privilege of consenting to the label was applied to you.  It seems that you, like many others designated as 'high-functioning', have found a way to appropriate the label without any corresponding loss of dignity.   Good for you.   I do not take it for granted that this was easy to accomplish, given that barriers to understanding still exist.    \n\nUnfortunately there are many others upon whom the label was imposed to satisfy the needs of bureaucrats, either as a means of exiling 'undesirables' from 'polite' society, or in the deluded expectation that the label would open up avenues to host of 'appropriate' services.      \n\nOne cannot even say that imposition of the label is always justified by good Science.   Often it is easier for doctors and administrators to retreat into what has become socially acceptable terminology, rather than to ask hard questions about why an individual shows distress in certain situations, or \nhas neurological deficits leading to social and academic dysfunction.\nToo much speculation about autism remains in the realm of magical thinking.\nGenetic research has led nowhere, because no one knows what autism really is, apart from subjectively interpreted behavioral criteria.       \n\nFarbeit from those in positions of authority to heed any testimony which might contradict, bring into question, mitigate, or modify ASD diagnosis in such cases.  \nAfter all, the purpose of bureaucracy is not to provide solutions, but to justify its own continued existence.   \n\nSo you, like the speaker, are among the privileged.   You will do well to thank God for that privilege, and the freedom which accompanies it.   \n\nIf in the Kingdom of God race does not matter, nor  nationality, nor class, nor gender, then neither shall psychological diagnosis matter.   The love of God expressed in Christ's sacrifice on the Cross overcomes all such distinctions._ I‚Äôve always wondered why I‚Äôm so different than most people have always had a hard time with crowds and distractions.. people can‚Äôt handle my emotions most of the time ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm autistic I don‚Äôt know anything_ @dabbnmike7595¬† \nDo you like the way you are, or do you wish that certain things were different?   You seem very well equipped to express your thoughts, which certainly is an advantage.   I'm not convinced that you should seek a 'label'.\nGod doesn't judge us by labels which other humans give us.   \n\nIf you put your trust in Jesus, He will reshape you in the direction He wants, which is sure to benefit you in the long run.   I had what I thought wer some problems with my personality, which I knew doctors would not be able to fix, so I prayed for God's help.   After a few years I noticed that some of those issues had melted  away gradually._ @jesusislordsavior6343¬† Dude, why do you keep trying to convert people in God belief?_ @filipeflower¬† \nFair question, other dude. \nI have no power to convert anyone.  God's Spirit does the converting.  However He has COMMANDED Christian to preach the Gospel, to tell the world about Jesus.   We do have a role to play.   So as you see, I am just following orders.   Whether I do it well or badly, that is for Him to judge,\nnot you or me.     \n\nThis is what Jesus told His disciples before ascending:\n\n(Matthew 28: 19-20)   'Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I comanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.'  \n\nHow do you think I became a Christian?   Various other people had to speak to me before I was prepared to believe.   But I wouldn't say that any single individual was responsible for my conversion._ @jesusislordsavior6343¬† What part of \"I don't believe in god\" didn't you understand?_ Unlimited?\nNo.\nQuite limited by time and space.\nYou‚Äôre trapped.\nOnly everything is unlimited,\nVaccines cause cancer‚Ä¶_ @filipeflower¬† \nDid you say that?    So what?   Do you expect me to be impressed?   \nTo feel intimidated by your juvenile audacity?   There is nothing to be understood.    Don't try to project your own deficits upon another person.  \nIt is your understand which is lacking.   \n\n'The fool has said in his heart, \"There is no God.\"   They are corrupt and have committed abominable injustice.'   (Psalm 53:1)\n\nNote the interesting juxtaposition of ideas.  How does that reflect upon your own attitudes and behavior?   I don't need to know; it is something for you to consider on your own._ @jesusislordsavior6343¬† Yes, I did say that on another comment. You either forgot about it or you're simply ignoring it.\nAnd as a Christian, you shouldn't be judgemental, but you are (at least, with me). In case you don't remember, I said \"I don't believe in god. I hope you can respect that\". But what did I get instead? A judgement from you. That's not respect._ @filipeflower¬† \nWhat do mean by 'being judgmental'?   More to the point, \nwhat do you suppose that Christ meant when He said, 'Do not judge, so that you will not be judged'?    You seem to equate criticism with judgment, \nSeeing that you do not believe in Him and have no intention of obeying Him, perhaps it is not your place to 'judge' me either. \n\nWouldn't it make more sense to consider Christ's admonition in the context of His wider teaching, much of which had to do with His identity as Son of God and the defining characteristic of the Kingdom of God.    \n\nWould you remove the verse neatly from its context, as so many do, and use it to bolster your own defense against Christianity?    Would you twist its meaning to suggest that 'being nice' should be the highest priority of Christians?     How self-serving!  Do you desire a blank cheque permitting you to say anything you please without risk of rebuke or repercussion?\nIsn't that censorship in disguise?       \n \nWas Jesus saying\n(a) that no discrimination is to be made between truth and falsehood,\nright and wrong;\n(b) that one should never criticize another person's views or behavior;\n(c) that one should not warn another person of the possible negative consequences of his behavior and/or attitudes?\n\n\nIt would be preposterous to assume that He meant any of these three things.   Please bear in mind that by speaking with you as I have done, \nI have treated you as an intelligent, responsible person in full possession of his faculties, which I think implies respect on my part.  I took your long-term best interest to heart, for as it says, God 'desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.'   \nI have NOT judged your soul, because I neither assumed that you were beyond redemption, nor laid any kind of curse upon you. \n\nYou may be surprised to hear it, but I don't have a very high opinion of my own character.   This kind of conversation is rather like one criminal recommending to another the very best lawyer on the planet.      \n\nYou may have felt 'judged', but this does not necessarily reflect reality.\n\nYou must remember that I was only responding to aggressive attacks which you initiated.   I saw no reason why I should put up with your provocations.   It is possible that I went overboard sometimes, but to diminish you as a human being or even to hurt your feelings was not my intent.  \n\nRest assured, I hope that long-term happiness will be in store for you. \nRemember Jesus when in trouble, if not sooner._ @jesusislordsavior6343¬† Like I said, I don't want your god belief shoved into my head. The least you can do is stop that and walk away. But no, you keep insisting on it. Not to mention you've been posting that kind of comment on multiple comment threads on YouTube.

I don't know anyone who has autism personally but I think it is not a debilitating condition.  I know there is different levels of it though.  Not to mention the stuff about vaccines causing Autism (which I personally don't believe) it was interesting to get a perspective of someone who has Autism_ Him: Explains what stimming is\n\nThat one bit of hair of mine that‚Äôs just curls of boredom: nodding aggressively_ If majority of ppl were autistic then we would treat previously \"normal\" ppl like we treat autists now.

I wish there was a cure for autism. What of the severely autistic people who will never be able to have proper relationships, speak or use the toilet independently?

Really awesome presentation._ Absolutely great talk !_ What an incredible man. I learned a lot from his speech._ Way to go... Completely agree! I Could definitely learn more on how to deal and react to autistic people_ I have ASD too and I would so like to meet Ethan and share perspectives_ I can still remember when my sister shouted to my friend from across the road i told her to shut up \nAnd she was hurt by it ... Didnt even give me a chance to explain i dont do that cause i dont want all eyes on me and i dont know if it is my friend yet ... And you just shouted his name in the street ...

So, you might not realise someone is autistic if they are light-mid level autistic. People all have their different ways of how they behave. I am light to mid-level autistic. I doubt most people would be able to figure out. This talk does relate to the people who behave like this, but, some don't act like this._ A big contributor is testosterone in utero thats particularly a thyroid issues as far as control valve for hormone levels so its possible that autism spectrum disorder is 20% and it shows up in men more becaus  \nThe develop in men versus women experiences more neuro typically trates for girls but testosterone in later development vs estrogen extremes could be behind gender spectrum disorder, its not a disorder just a expresion through  so ya its food or environment effects on endocrine system the neglect of which benefits no one so ii implor you look in to the endocrine system to have a better understanding of mental health sexuality and autism spectrums respectively_ I don't skip TEDx' ads because I know they deserve it even if it takes more than a minute. What they give to us is better than regular youtubers. ‚ù§Ô∏è_ One of my new favorite ted talks_ Clearer, more direct and more compelling speaker than many non-autistic speakers._ his hair is everything!!!_ While I applaud this person for giving this presentation, the mere fact that he's able to give this talk puts him in a drastically different category from other people with autism. He's verbal, cognizant and able to control his impulses so that he can actually function in society. This is not the case for many individuals with autism who can't form full sentences, are aggressive, are self injurious and are tortured by their own impulses on a daily basis. They can have little to no quality of life and any thought of these individuals ever being able to speak normally, let alone give a TED talk, is simply impossible. It would be a pipe dream for some parents for their children to reach a level functionality this individual presents. Their condition is very much a disability and any attempt to prevent anyone else from being born with this disability should be encouraged.\n\nI'm not trying to discredit this individual or invalidate his experiences. It's great that he's able to give a voice for others like him. But him giving a ted talk called \"What's it REALLY like to have Autism\" does in a way invalidate the so called \"low functioning\" autistic individuals. And that by no means is his fault. The way autism is diagnosed puts this person and a non-verbal, self injurious aggressive individual who struggles with going to the bathroom at 30 years old in the same category. This is the so called \"spectrum\" and it just isn't right. The current autism diagnosis just sows confusion, misunderstanding, misconceptions and misinformation. \n\nAgain, I'm glad this person is able to give a voice to people like him but please remember that there are many people who are significantly \"disabled\" by what's also called Autism. If you really do want to know what it's like to have Autism, talk to the family members of those who are \"lower functioning\"_ Autism is the reason I don't feel isolated during lockdown.\nWho says there are no benefits?\nNo friends = No bullshit.\nNo romance = No heartache and endless strategies.\nHowever, I am very aware that we autistics are a community, so I wish you peace, love and equality.\n                    God bless._ I thought you were Jesus because of the weird filter of your icon, but then I read the comment and realized I was close._ @HereTakeAFlower¬† lmaoo_ @HereTakeAFlower¬† you could have used your talent to make effective pick-up lines, and you chose to make compliments instead_ @pandanina¬† you have my same hair wtf_ Autistic people are real life ANGELS!!_ @HereTakeAFlower¬† amazed!_ @fernandojvalencia8151¬† Glad you said that because i happen to be one of them_ @fernandojvalencia8151¬† why?_ @Karen Johnson Then start treating them like people._ Yes_ Struggling? I don‚Äôt see him struggling._ @SomeGal¬† \nThat's because nonautistic people struggle to read autistic people and nonautistic people demand us to hide our differences as he said people don't let him express his emotions because he's on the two extremes._ @fernandojvalencia8151¬† no. Autistic people are simply different. Don't act like they were all angels that's not good either_ Well said David._ Not all of them are good or nice sadly‚Ä¶_ My friend who has autism doxxed someone out of malice for bullying him_ This is great!_ @fernandojvalencia8151¬† no need to infantile them. Autistic people are just as capable of bad things as any other person_ It was almost that same mentality that \"white Americans\" hate black people._ I don't think anyone is normal_ @bulldog6369¬† \nNo one is normal and that's why mankind can't create a standard norm everyone fits, we're to learn from history but mankind keeps failing to learn that where there's \"normal people,\" discrimination, cultural prejudice, oppression, racism and conflict lurks.\n\nMankind can't seem to learn that applying normality to that which is undeniably diverse is flawed._ @danielmoore4024¬† Hit the nail on the head._ What we value most is hustle, the quicker you can get on page with everyone else, the better off you are. For an autist or any other person for that matter, it could become  restricting on what you can do with your life. I‚Äôd argue everyone knows this sucks. We began to loose ourselves and not know why, let‚Äôs just chill out and take our little steps to progress ‚úåÔ∏è_ Dr Yuching Lee¬† Cannabis, mugwort and lavender helps me but  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a a cure.

Bravo!üëèüëèüëè_ Dr Yuching Lee¬†  While he may benefit from certain herbal teas & tinctures that can help people to be more relaxed or calm when feeling anxious, It‚Äôs far more likely that he just got better at masking over time, but may not want you to know, given your perspective, assumptions & judgements. This sort of thing is pretty common between teens or pre-teens & their parents, whether autistic or not. If that‚Äôs the case, you‚Äôll miss out on ever truly knowing him & he may never feel he can share his concerns with you going forward.

And as women we have learned to adapt and mask better. Because a lot of us hide ourselves behind a more acceptable personas, we experience elavated anxiety levels. Depression, anxiety disorder and even not knowing who we realy are beneath the mask anymore are not uncommon. \nI am happy most days, because I choose a way of life that suits me. But I do suffer from social exhaustion. If I go to a party that I enjoy - I love my friends - I suffer from heightend anxiety, sensoric overload and depressiv thoughs for 2 days afterwards._ so what?_ @ Steven Flannery   Hi.  Great point about the problem with the current reductivist classificatory system. \nSince very few people really understand how classifications work - and the fact that these sytems often simply distort real differences, you often end up with multiple problems of interpretation, and limited sensitivity. \nI'm wondering how you would address the problem of providing some kind of model that could assist \"everyone\" - therapeutic practitioners and members of society.  Hope to hear from you. Regards._ Thank you Stephen.  I have the same feelings you do here.  At 40 years old, I have recently been diagnosed as high-functioning.  Mine was only discovered because my 5 year old was born severely autistic.  He was literally stimming in the womb.  As I started to understand ASD, I started to recognize my own childhood.  My son and I have the genetic micro deletion  often associated with ASD.  Anyway, to your point-if it were just me-absolutely I‚Äôd agree that ‚Äòwe‚Äô have super powers and no ‚Äúcure‚Äù is needed as often stated by people on the milder end of the spectrum.  That being said, my baby TRULY SUFFERS with Autism.  As his mother, my heart is broken by what the poor little fellow endures.  He is a danger to himself and other children. As and adult, it is possible he will be a danger to adults as well. This talk was WONDERFUL and I am grateful this individual was brave enough to share his thoughts.  My biggest concern is with the line of thinking that ‚ÄúAutism does not need a cure.‚Äù  It 100% does!  If you are cognizant enough to feel like it doesn‚Äôt, then you should be able to make that choice and not take treatment.  For people like my sweet baby, however, who is truly suffering from ASD, I‚Äôm terrified that this attitude will keep potential scientists from studying, donors from donating, and other professions from actively seeking cures/more effective treatments.  Some of us are desperate for them!_ In this commentary section there are finally normal, respectful and caring people. We are not the 'average' mindset. I cant see it as a disease. My diagnosis was my healing._ I remember people just tossing the word around like an insult._ ived well, laughed often, and loved much;\nWho has enjoyed the trust of pure women, the respect of intelligent men and the love of little children;\nWho has filled his niche and accomplished his task;\nWho has never lacked appreciation of Earth's beauty or failed to express it;\nWho has left the world better than he found it,\nWhether an improved poppy, a perfect poem, or a rescued soul;\nWho has always looked for the best in others and given them the best he had;\nWhose life was an inspiration;\nWhose memory a benediction._ He's so sweet_ My son looks so much like him with the fabulous hair, his take is that Autistic people are more evolved. It's the dry skin and touching paper sounds that bother him the most._ My brothers buddy Jared is like an older brother to me he works full time construction for my dad and helps my brother around his house..... he really loves reading books on his spare time.  He‚Äôs 24 now and he has a bigger heart then most people ik in my life autism isn‚Äôt always super horrible stay humble everyone_ who down votes a video like this?_ One thing he forgot to explain, Autistics hear everything at the same volume. We also hear extra sounds ordinary people wouldn‚Äôt notice. Example: If I‚Äôm in my living room I can hear the buzz of the fridge, a hammer being used on a metal object several blocks away, the pipes in my house as water runs through them, the tap water running, wind outside, my family talking, a ringing in my ears, my dog breathing, my own breathing, my family‚Äôs breathing, the fly in the window trying to get out, etc... all at the same volume._ Excellent insight. My son also has ASD and I agree with everything you said, would love to see you talk again and offer some further guidance for teens and fathers on communication and social interaction. üëä_ I have Autism and I love this speech. Its very hard to make friends and to learn complex materials. Yes I don't know body language very well but am learning it. I never talk to people unless they talk first and never laugh at their jokes._ I am not against this but feel something wrong with this video.. normalization and changing the public perception of not questioning it.. Some uncorrupted scientific community should do research on why this happens.. I heard from many like vaccination is a major cause of this.._ I also have autism and I agree with everything you‚Äôve said. I mask very very well and was diagnosed at the age of 13. I had to mature (‚Äúgrow up‚Äù) very fast, because of my autism, and that‚Äôs why I get along with adults more than the freshman my age. I wish for you many happy days and the best of luck._ Is it me or does Ethan kinda look like Jared Leto? üòÑ_ This guy is truly AUSOME! üòéüôåüèª‚ù§Ô∏è_ Big hugs for this lil dude :) !!! - so brave and wellspoken and on point ! Thank you._ To be diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder does not mean that you have a disease; it is actually an other way of communicating and another kind of perception!_ I‚Äôve got it myself and tbh, I do see it as a hassle and I don‚Äôt like any of it. Maybe the part that I‚Äôm a bit more intelligence then others, at least they say I am, I‚Äôm not that sure abt it. Everyday I just observe people who are considered normall and dream abt that life, being social and just accepted in general. I never tell people that I‚Äôm autistic because I know the majority will treat you different even if they all tell they won‚Äôt. And I‚Äôm 25 already and I‚Äôm just nowhere near the career and social life I‚Äôd like to be and do not know how to change this because I think I‚Äôve tried a lot. Although finding help is a no go for me because I think I‚Äôve got to do it by myself\nTo prove to me I‚Äôm not that weird.._ I can mask not just on level of behavior, but also on level of thought and expression. My ability to seem normal works so great, that  people dont even see me as weird, something I can see the guy in the video certainly looks autistic and weird to me. But I do have problems with signal processing in the brain. Because of this, I am well aware of the non autistic world, but simply cannot handle it very well in terms of signal processing. I cannot go to work, or education, since every single signal I receive (which can be thousends in a few seconds of talking to someone)  needs to be carefully processed in such a way, that it can take days, weeks or even months to process them. Thats why I have to practice social distancing as much a possible, just because I cannot process the signals in time._ ''How do I know?'' Because you have... ''BECAUSE I HAVE AUTISM!''_ Congratulations Ethan. Bravo_ I don‚Äôt really believe that all the autistic people are like the way he described at the start but the boy in my class is pretty similar to that description (except for the dull part)_ After series ‚Äúone has autism‚Äù \n‚ÄúOne has brain cancer‚Äù \n\nWhat‚Äôs the difference?_ What do you mean?ü§î Sorry that I deleted my first comment, I just felt like I made you feel upset so I deleted it so you didn't feel badüòñ_ @teyarust6727¬† i obviously didn't see your original comment, but from what i have read here, i believe B.

It can sting if it happens to involve something you can identify with, but remember how little you care when it‚Äôs not about something that involves you, and you know how much the insult really matters in the first place._ Sharon Jensen It‚Äôs very admirable of you to not use terms that could hurt people. I don‚Äôt agree that the terms are always used to hurt someone. Language isn‚Äôt a one on one literal translations of the meaning of words. You have to look at intent. Someone can use derogatory terms with other intent than to hurt someone. I do understand and agree that it‚Äôs distasteful, but just because someone uses a word doesn‚Äôt mean someone else should be able to lay claim on what that person meant to say by using the word. Banning words is censorship and close to burning books._ this type of autism causes a severe lack of attention to non-communicating autism (the real autism). there needs to be a different name for the two because they are so drastically different_ At my school people like to use it as an insultüòî_ People still do üòî_ I hate to break it to you, but it still is._ Not really relatable and/or comparable, but same with the word \"Gay\"._ One of my closest friends was diagnosed with Autism in Kindergarten and hid it throughout the entirety of elementary school.

It would be amazing if you helped_ People STILL do that wdym?\nI‚Äôm autistic and I hear people make fun of it all the time...._ Yongo Bazuk¬† Good thing._ I also hear ‚Äúautistic‚Äù and the ‚ÄúR‚Äù Word being used as an insult. I am sensitive to this because I have two children on the Autism Spectrum. All we can do is educate people. Sometimes, people are unaware of the pain they inflict when they use these words. On a positive note, the humanity shown to my children far outweighs any indecency that has occurred with my kids. People are so kind & understanding. The most difficulty occurred when my son was young and I had to explain that he has autism. Now that he is an adult it is so obvious‚Ä¶ no explanation needed. If only, people just trust that mom‚Äôs are doing the best they can with a toddler/child  that is having a difficult day._ @dancingtoledo¬† I wish you the best._ @dancingtoledo¬† Well said. My daughter is autistic and she is low functioning so when hear it it reminds me that there is alot of education to be done. The most \"woke\" will still use it and it's not right. I worry about my daughter's future when I'm not around and it keeps me up. God bless you üôè_ @atonebenino¬† Blessings to you as well. We are all in this together!_ @atonebenino¬† \nYou're not alone concerned about your daughter, my dad is concerned about who's going to support me.\nI'm producing a book to educate the public about how autistic people see the world and what autistic people say could help them, like with communication most find it easier to understand things spoken specifically. \n\nI hope if any professionals read my book they will realise their hypocrisy._ @danielmoore4024¬† That's a good step. By the way, can we chat outside YouTube?_ @filipeflower¬† \nI'll do so by email, I don't know any other ways._ @danielmoore4024¬† I already gave you my email. We can talk there, if you want._ @filipeflower¬†\nI can't find any email address anywhere, I typed in the search box \"email inbox\" and there's nothing there._ @danielmoore4024¬† How about here?_ @filipeflower¬† \nWe can talk here_ @danielmoore4024¬† Do you see my email written in my comment ?_ @filipeflower¬† \nNo_ @danielmoore4024¬† How about now?_ @filipeflower¬† \nWe can_ @danielmoore4024¬† Right now, I have my job to go to. Try sending me emails via the email thing I gave you here._ @danielmoore4024¬† Okay, I'm back. Did you see my previous comments here? I posted my email here, so you could send me messages via that._ @filipeflower¬† \nI need to take a break as I'm unwell, delete your email address as I've copied it._ @danielmoore4024¬† Okay. Don't forget to write me an email._ It kinda is though. I say that as an aspie_ @144elect6¬† What do you mean?_ I know how it feels, it's just hurtful._ I hate when people do it. I remember people did that with Down syndrome before (at least in my country, dc about english speaking world), and it kinda made sense (tho still is offensive), but calling people autistic as an insult is just stupid and makes no sense._ @wortoxmanes4357¬† lol seriously._ Remember that. It was horrible_ When someone is the slightest bit of selfish, I hear people say \"that person is so autistic\" in a negative way. What people realise it that autism ‚â† selfish. and also not the other way around_ It doesn't make much sense if you ask me. Satoshi Tajiri has autism. As do Anthony Hopkins, Dan Aykroyd and Elon Musk. It almost sounds more like a compliment._ They still do_ Now it‚Äôs bi-polar and narcissist._ People still say autism as an insult. 2022 from decades ago._ As someone who basically fits nearly all the ‚Äúnegative stereotypes‚Äù showed on the board on the beginning, I‚Äôve been called autistic as an insult all too much_ It still kind of is, especially on the internet with some of the rather offensive memes._ people who I used to consider friends used to call me autism instead of autumn and it genuinely angered my soul_ @azulizachan7595¬† other people have autism too get over it_ People in my class still do_ Smart people_ My son is three year old and diagnose with Autism ,,,, it mean he will speak nd can live normal life_ Syd Barger¬† What do you mean?_ Same_ That study was bullshit._ I was diagnosed when I was 2 years old only because my older brother was diagnosed with Severe Autism. When they diagnosed me, They paid really close attention to me. But yeah, I can sort of relate to you. I feel like I get along better with people either a few years younger than me or a few years older than me. people my age are a little bit complicated so I have a little bit of a hard time communicating with them._ That's not why u get along with adults more than the freshman ur age_ With no beards_ Well for something that isnt a disease i sure want a cure really badly_ That's why it's a spectrum_ I could never stand and talk on stage like that._ Just happens to be a white male üòÇüòÇ_ BRAVO!!!!!!!!!!!!_ I thank you for this talk. I am one insecure and overpowered young autistic adult who has never found a satisfaction in social conversations. Even in my own family, the jokes, references and names I make out of are just cringeworthy to say the least to a point I am embarrassed. I do believe I have friends at my British college, but there are days where I don't bother speaking until they speak at me possibly. All the lost opportunities for potential friends at my old school life was washed away from me having to secure and look after myself in a high school where the less intelligent idiots tried to bring me down in front of my classmates. Out of education and several online media accounts everywhere gone to waste or what not prove that gaining a random big social media following is not for my own security and case of life. Yesterday I quit twitter for good because I made a pretty bad tweet unintentionally and got abused for it by arseholes who like to kick those down below them. I am thankful for not giving up on my life after several suicidal thoughts because of my high trauma and severe anxiety I know I have. Most trauma comes from mass spending or garbage I would just waste away and never use like I have donated for a baf charity. After lockdown is over I will make sure to improve my self image whilst keeping in mind of how harsh world it is for autistic people like me._ 8:03._ this girl on tiktok @paigelayle made a four pt series about how different autism looks in girls and how much longer it takes to diagnose autism in girls since it hasn't been studied as much as it has in males but i think we'll start to see more and more progress in both directions! and it's got some really great first hand experience if y'all are interested! warning: its emotionally charged (which isn't necessarily a bad thing üòÅ)_ Thank you for coming forward. I feelless lonely. Even with the screen. Masking 24/7 is just so exhausting._ Having autism is terrible, according to this video, I don't want to have autism..._ I got nothing to say but it was lovely‚ù§Ô∏èüñ§üíñ_ If you disliked this video you must be someone who uses autism as an insult._ My music is for AUTISM üé§üéºüéπüé∂ your AWESOME üëâüë§üëè‚úäüëçüëçüòé hope to see you in my concert one dayüëÄ_ \"You may think of autism as these things, but it's not true. I'm autistic (and most of these things).\" wat\n\nI think I'm autistic but was never tested. In high school I went to a psychologist/psychiatrist convinced that something was wrong with me or different about me, but she just asked me why I thought that, didn't do any tests, and just told me to (literally) think happy thoughts three times a day.\n\nI'm 32 and am still socially awkward and have abnormal speech. I've graduated college and have a (low-paying) career, but I wish I'd had speech classes when I was younger. I'm also really short, so everywhere I go people give me funny looks.\n\nI fit many of the traits/stereotypes. I'm obsessive with my interests (I love lists and sorting and categorizing things), don't like extreme loudness, am considered weird and awkward (I've also always been told that I walk in a weird way), and pretty much never start conversations with strangers just to talk. I'm not defiant, though; I've never had a problem with authority and was probably considered a teacher's pet throughout school._ Autism like so many other human conditions is grossly misunderstood by typical people._ Thanks Ted for this video ‚ù§Ô∏è_ Autism is not natural and you should be proud of who you are. Autism is a neurodevelopment disorder. Just because you have a condition doesn‚Äôt or shouldn‚Äôt let anyone think of you less. Autism,mis sadly on the rise. You are probably 10% of the ASD population. High functioning. Seeing a individual with mild to moderate or moderate to severe is devastating and a huge diverse problem for the family. The toxic environment is the genetic gun._ He is saying that but what about the severe autistic_ Autism is called as Ëá™ÈñâÁóá (self \"closed\" disorder) in Japan. I argue the name of this one should be changed to another considerate one._ I'll take autism over narsassism any day. 3 of my nephews are labeled to have autism..I was diagnosed with my own neurological \"disorder\" many moons ago. I hate labels. üòí_ it's not easy to say that. autism is just a status, all of them will get it in another side of life. thankful for this video, it help me empathy with all the people we met._ Thank you, Ethan. I get you.\nAutism or Asperger's, it's just another wonderful perspective woven into the tapestry we call our diversity._ ...like most people. What's your point?_ Ok, libtard_ ..._ What?_ Antw√¢n I know, man...\n\nEspecially at work.\n\nIt sucks._ I disliked it and i have autism myself. I wish there was a cure because i hate living like this. Ted talks like this place autism as some cutesy little \"disorder\". Oh we just think differently. Not really, for a lot of people it can be very debilitating._ @josef7461¬† You're very mis-informed. Try getting information from a trustworthy professional._ @filipeflower¬† how condescending is that. How quick the likes of you are to tell someone they're uneducated or they need to see a professional. How about you get educated, how about you talk to people with autism such as me, and they will tell you how much it sucks._ @josef7461¬† For Your Information, I happen to be autistic myself. But I discovered other information sources that tell what autism can be applied to._ @filipeflower¬† well im glad to hear it, i hope you have a great life where others have failed. (not sarcasm btw)_ @josef7461¬† Thank you. And I think I can apologize if I sounded sarcastic or condescending. It's just that I found some people around here pretending to be autistic._ You should probably look for someone who can diagnose you again\n\n\"Think happy thoughts three times a day\" seems like sketchy advice, specially from someone who doesn't give you any tests_ Your first \"quote\" makes no sense. He gave examples of a stereotypes that were untrue and explained that he is autistic and does not fit those stereotypes._ I remember thinking that he seemed to fit some of the stereotypes he mentioned._ Sharon Jensen ‚ù§Ô∏èüíôüíõüíØ üß©_ Yes and no_ @bullrun2772¬† What's that supposed to mean?_ @filipeflower¬†  ye and no ofc_ @filipeflower¬† it means autism hasn't had an effect on him or his children. Ignorance_ @atonebenino¬† Who?_ @atonebenino¬† \nThis is not ignorance by the speaker, all he said is true and he is effected as he described.\n\nIf neurotypical people would stop it with all the bickling assumptions and hypocrisy, and instead actually listen to those of us on the spectrum you may learn how to help those more dependent. Unfortunately neurotypical people are too doubtful and sabotage us instead, countless times professionals have told parents their children will need full-time residential care, guess what?\n\nAll the parents who left the medical model and listened to the autism community instead found the professionals were extremely mistaken and their children not needing full-time residential care.\n\nParents follow the medical model and find their children require full-time residential care.\nOther parents pay attention and listen to the autistic community and find their children have a successful life.\nWhat does that say?_ @danielmoore4024¬† that they are severely or very severely mentally challenged but there is so much work to do about this_ @lucylucifer7282¬† \nThere's not much work at all, back at school I were with unverbal teenagers, by the end of the year after I spending an hour each day with them they became verbal.\n\nI simply treat them as human beings, people on The Human Spectrum, not broken outcasts._ @danielmoore4024¬† What do you study all day? You don't understand we are so dead we have the thinking of about a 2 years old...  And nobody seems is doing something about it 2 years old cant understand things not even that they are so stupid cause they have the mental thinking of a 2 years old so is quite hard sometimes  to understand... You say that the neurtypicale doesn't do anything they actually go to school and do important things as math or physics and go to university...  You should buy some books they are actually using and see all the advanced stuff I steal them from my brother and punch him if he tries to get them from me back they are not that advanced to me anyway but they ar4 kind of very advanced compar3d to the crap  the autistic people see_ @lucylucifer7282¬† If that's all you know, then you're highly mis-informed. It's already been proven in the real world that Autistic people can do more than just that._ @filipeflower¬† I don't want to talk about it I don't want to talk with anyone...  I'm forever done...  I don't want to think... I'm autistic too I got hit very very hard knowing that I'm a loser.. Many of them use Albert Einstein as his leader or dumb Michael phelps, clearly you are not that stupid as that genetically superior photo of a solider you are using... I'm not fighting the genetically superior any more so I'm not gonna fight with you about why they suck... They don't achieve great things okay? Now let me lonely... I tries to explain to Moore why he is trash but it's like I'm talking to a wall...  Go to your path... Do what you want and I do my path lonely.... I work very well lonely deciphering stuff tell him what you want but I'm not gonna to believe your crap.._ @lucylucifer7282¬† And just who are you to decide who's trash and who isn't? That's the kind of thinking that prevents people from succeeding._ @filipeflower¬† you said that they can do more than just that... Tell me what they can do? You don't tell me cause you don't know nothing... And nobody wants to fight me...  You will never gonna reply back to me cause you don't know what to say so just shut up if you don't want to be destroyed in public... üòé üö¨ I will cure myself lonely I don't need anyone else... Everyone is against me but I'm right...  I'm sure I can cure those crap brain diseases üö¨ üòéüòéüòéüòé_ @lucylucifer7282¬† For example, I myself managed to get a job and a girlfriend while being autistic at the same time. And I also found a person in my country who's not only autistic, but also the president of an Association. It goes to show that Autism itself doesn't stop you from achieving this._ @filipeflower¬† you are not gonna to succeed only because you think you are a winner üèÜüéâüèÜ that's bs...  Many people think that they are winners but they are still losers...  You don't know nothing at all...  I'm glad you got a gf but many can't I just want to finish school completely ...  They don't achieve nothing that's bs from the director_ @filipeflower¬† many people believe they are fucking great because they have s job_ @lucylucifer7282¬† And what makes you think that, may I ask?_ @filipeflower¬† Did you know that Ted talks are for dumb people? Maybe it's more easy to lie to autistic people than tell the truth...  All the people that gets in Ted talks is for making them feel important but they are quite stupid TED Is for teddy bearüß∏ üë∂ I don't watch them you better read books if you want to learn something I think it's better of course  I don't know why those people are still alive_ @lucylucifer7282¬† I have books, thank you.

Do you want my money for free? 1 million dollars but for later I have to work it_ @lucylucifer7282¬† \nI'm brill thanks, my friends and I just had a buffet at The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints together.\nI'm not interested in money, I prefer the money to go to those who actually need it. \n\nI go to knowledge more advanced than those at university, I read books by specialists who've actually finished university and investigate beyond that level, that's how I know how to turn Autism from a nightmare into an asset and great gift._ @danielmoore4024¬† I once was like you wanted the money to those that actually need it  so you don't want to do nothing with a million dollars?  The another day I told you that you was so stupid... I'm sorry for that I'm not good at talking I always talk a lot of crap I think I'm the stupid or something else...  I hope you are okay and doing good at your stuff I'm the stupid... Sorry I feel so bad about it...  So what books do you have about it? Where you from? I'm wrong in a lot of crap all the fucking time... Things are very complex so maybe I'm wrong what people do you follow?_ @lucylucifer7282¬† \nI buy books from Amazon that are validated by professionals and outside of the education system. One example is \"The Power of Neurodiversity\" by PhD. Thomas Armstrong. \nI have another by Temple Grandin called \"The Autistic Mind.\"\nI read some by Dr. Damian Milton who was the first professional to propose the double empathy problem.\nI've listened to individuals all over the spectrum listening to the challenges they face that I don't.  \n\nIf I had a million dollars or where I am pounds I wouldn't know what to spend it on, I already possess all I need, that's why I donate to several charities, tithe and help my family with financial matters._ @danielmoore4024¬† hmmm it's nice that you are okay I will read one of them to show you my sympathy and empathy I think that even if I'm autistic I learned empathy through experience staying in those situations were you can broke people heart and that hurts me and what they are going through... Maybe you should try to experience the same maybe you can have empathy for people if you don't what do you teach to autistic children? I want to sleep now I'm a bit sleepy Try to lewrn things through experience and may e you are gon a see a lot more even if you are autistic I will be around here working on  my laptop doing stuff..._ @danielmoore4024¬† I would spent a million dollars buying a home in California where I was supposed to be born I'm from Mexico but somehow I turned 100 American or maybe I just need friends in Mexico and I would be right but I don't have the Mexican spirit anyway... \n\nBuying and going or watching videos about üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏ feels more alive than even life itself it's crazy I should die there if I'm gonna die NO? I don't know what fucking happened to my brain when I was a child....  Maybe it was the CIA they implanted me some chips since I was a child to not make those nuclear bombs and instead go home where I can be happy but who knows? Do you have brain books or something? I'm not sure I will be right in California soon I'm so stupid that I have nothing to say that's why I talk to you....  \n\nTrying to have friends of similar disease maybe thats gonna help me... Because I have nothing to say hmmm autistic people only know a thing or two in the subject they are studying ok bye I have to go to sleep..._ @lucylucifer7282¬† \nI do have empathy, I help and support both autistic and nonautistic people.\nI teach autistic people how to increase their tolerance to stimulus, remind them communication is a two way street, I teach them to focus less on their weaknesses and more on their talents and strengths, I point out to them just how hypocritical the accusations of neurotypical people are, that neurotypical people are the ones who have a problem because of their arrogance and hypocrisy._ It‚Äôs from the vaccines_ Autism is not on the rise, diagnosis of autism is on the rise. It's not neurodevelopmental, it's neurological. I was born with autism, i never developed it. Thats a myth. Most autistic people are like me and this man. Under the radar. People who are severely disabled by asd usually get the spotlight. And no vaccines dont cause autism, thay notion is frankly absurd._ There isn't such thing as severe autism. I have autism myself, I could be classed as severe in some things, and mild in others. Autism isn't a spectrum, it's a load of switches._ @ethansdeadchannel671¬† there are some symptoms of autism that can be very extreme. Search up extreme autism on YouTube_ Hehehe, the Greek root of autism means directed toward one self (autos=self, autis=toward the self). the root word autos   is found in many modern words like automobile(self-mover) and autograph(self-drawing/personal drawing)_ I wouldn't wish ASD on my worst enemy. I wanted to end my own life before i got a diagnosis and received help to behave normally. I wanted to die at age 12! It was difficult to get through and it makes me sick how people laugh it off as some \"disorder\". It's not just some disorder, it has negatively affected my life in so many ways._ @josef7461¬† thats not because of autism_ Tapestry?_ autism rates are through the roof from what they were 50 years ago.  It's vaccines._ This dude is cool_ Thank you for this! This was an amazing talk and much needed. People often judge and it makes me sad. I have a 4 yr old son who is autistic and non verbal and I find myself constantly explaining why he isn‚Äôt communicating or why he is making noises or movements that may seem odd to others. It helped me understand things from my son view since he can‚Äôt express himself. Thank you for being brave and making people aware of autism!_ Thank you so much for talking of this argument and sharing your personal story. I know a lot of autistic people and they are so wonderful persons. Lovely watching and listening to you here in the top of Trentino Italy mountain._ <3_ This was a great summation of what life is like for me as well. It‚Äôs interesting the ways we‚Äôre similar even though every one on the spectrum is totally different from each other._ I feel like crying at the end of the video. You are no different. You are one of us. ‚ù§üíå_ Personally, I think autism is just another type of personality. As you say, another type of thinking and processing emotions. Everyone has challenges, we all have to deal with. We should simply not care if a person has autism or not, we should only care about her role in society and hopefully he or she is happy._ Gorgeous talk. Thanks so much._ I would have liked to see russian subs. Will they be added later?_ I too have autism and I'm sick of these sugarcoating wimps. The stereotypical symptoms in the beginning are very realistic. Just not every autistic person has all of them or equally strong but look at it this way: If a person has 2 or less of these symptoms, they don't have autism... because these just are the symptoms. Learn to live with it and learn to overcome it as good as possible, but stop denying accurate symptoms because \"I don't like the way they sound, whe whe\"._ Thank you Ethan. I have a lot of problems when my mask falls because of HMRC. Too many times has my ASD been revealed and then I'm fired because \"they don't have time to train me\". That was the latest one...... there's a whole continent of them and I'm not going through them._ I believe that autism is caused by neurotoxins introduced at infancy/early childhood.  Not a disease, but a brain injury affecting the gut flora/micro biome.  Every person is affected differently by these neurotoxins hence the spectrum as well as other mental and physical injuries.  \nIt's predicted that in 10 to 20yrs from now that 1 out of every two people will be autistic.\nAutism will be the new \"normal\", which I find extremely sad for those who suffer great mental and physical pains.\nYou can thank your corrupt government and big pharma for this._ I agree that autism is just part of the human spectrum‚ù§Ô∏è_ Great TEDTALK bro! Thank you for your time and information!_ There's always reasons for being autistic in this society, we may have different diseases, different religions, different colors skin, but we all belongs to one human race._ God bless this guy! My son is autistic and this guy is so brave to do this and speak out about autism from his personal view_ Perception, presumption, assumption, conspiring, the functionalism is an individual characteristic. It's what makes us who we are, intelligence variates, so does characteristics & etc.. to be socialcentric is being stereotype, for it is an incrowd advantage, for example majority & minority, but the difference is using it as dominance, unlike ethnocentrism, which is natural, for the mean time in process of evolution in thus lovely environmental pressure. To the fittist_ This is the same speech\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Ks21rwbYgbI_ Thank you! We‚Äôre aren‚Äôt diseased, just different :)_ No, it's increased awareness and better diagnosis methods. The same awareness this Ted talk is spreading and promoting acceptance of autism.:)_ Stupidity levels are through the roof from 50 years ago. It's the Internet._ Autism levels are NOT much higher then they were. It's just people are more aware, understand more and know how to express their feelings more due to information being more widely available._ You‚Äôre correct_ You're just wrong. Diagnosis is through the roof cos guess what. More people than we originally though had autism. Shocker. And no injecting a fluid wont rearrange your brain. Autistic people are born with autism._ Or maybe its because technology becomes advanced so it is easier to diagnose people?_ @brianpatterson1745¬† Or maybe its because technology becomes advanced so it is easier to diagnose people?_ @datechds9434¬† or maybe it's the massive litany of childhood injections causing more autism_ @dreaminginnoother¬† the countries in the world with most autistic people almost all have low vaccination rates_ Yep_ Are you a qualified Doctor?_ Theres no \"belief\" in where autism comes from. Its scientifically proven that it develops in the womb, and is more often than not hereditary._ Thank you Ethan. I have a daughter that is \"low functioning\" per society and is in a special home today. Yet, she has exceptionally amazing skills and memory. She is so smart in many ways,  but it is such a struggle to get her acclimated in the community._ I have autism_ For a second I thought that he was the Opeth singer_ My grandma (whom I love so much) used to tell me that if I were to change the things I eat everyday then I could be fixed. \nI love her, she meant it with her best intentions at heart._ I thought this was just going to be a meme compilation!_ This young man is definitely very high in the spectrum. He can express his ideas pretty well, probably attends college and has a relatively decent social live. Not my son. Besides having empathy and somehow able to withstand loud noises or bright lights,  he is socially awkward and cannot define or express his thoughts adequately. And most of his peers in his program are like that too. In brief, this young guy does not represent the  highest number of the autistic population. But I have to give it to him that he gave a fine presentation._ I gave some thought to human expression some years ago and came to the conclusion that we speak on up to seven different levels , which we are not aware of most of the time. \nThe first is part of body language which can be fragmented into a two parts and is postural language , which is followed by gestural language as second. Third is the language carried by the facial expression which can once again be fragmented into two subset , making the fourth language from the eyes or gaze as in where or what do we look at as part of communication. Last three parts are from our voice. Fifth is the words which we choose to use , sixth is the tone of voice with which those words are being spoken , and seventh is the inclination from each word spoken which may be hard for some to distinguish but which might be an obvious sign of deception or unease to others. Different languages make this deciphering a bit more difficult , and how well we know someone may make the process a bit easier as well. \nOn the topic of autism i admit that mild versions of it should be considered as simple quirks of personality instead of disorders , but i saw a documentary once that had a young women overcome her severe condition with the help of medicine and she explained very well how her senses , like earing , would fall into overload at random moments and that this was the reason for the most peculiar behaviour we have seen in people afflicted with this disorder. \nI sincerely hope we find the root cause of autism before taking drastic measures like vaccinating everyone against this covid-19 pandemic , because i would hate it if we learn only after the side effects that this vaccination could have on some of us._ A disorder is not equivalent to a disease.  To convince the world at large of his hope that we see Autism as a plus, what really would have to be shown is how autism, the autistic, can benefit society._ THANK YOU ETHAN..YOU SAID EXACTLY WHAT IS TRUE.\nYOUR MIND IS ONLY HARD FOR NURO TYPICALS TOO UNDERDTAND..LET YOUR HEART & MIND REJOICE..üï∫ü§∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è_ why those people aren't in a home lockdown?_ OMG_ More people need to see this._ ‚ù§üéµ_ Automatic and proud...._ Most people think different than I do, so what_ What is islam? https://shareislam.com/#!slide-0_ aww he's so adorable!! Society has to come to terms with difference without demonizing others!_ One of the questions about autism (worldwide, if one considers statistics important) is the blurry lack of consensus on what qualifies autism  ... different places spreading the range of definitions/signs/symptoms all over the place means the number becomes somewhat unreliable._ Im a music teacher, and one of my student is autistic. Sometimes, i dont really understand what in his mind. And then i realize that their imagination is so great, even greater then me. Which is amazing. Autism is a gift._ Hey friends.\nI am selling audio books with PDF for 1 USD each. Anyone wants to buy?_ I'm curious, how does your daughter communicate (if you don't mind sharing)?_ No one asked_ @user-gh5jc9tx5r¬† Nobody had to ask :) Thats what the comment section is for_ @lucyferyyna¬† \nno one asked_ @user-gh5jc9tx5r¬† stfu_ Exactly, functioning labels are so demeaning. As an autistic person I hate functioning labels._ I wish I had your daughters skills, sigh but I also have poor impulses, under regulation of attention, and bad memory from another condition. You know which one._ @livvlife¬†, same. I would love to hear from OP‚Äôs daughter._ The ‚Äúfunctioning‚Äù as I like to see it is the ability of the person to live on their own. No matter what even for high functioning such as myself can‚Äôt live a completely normal life as I don‚Äôt understand how certain things work. The main thing is that every person with autism has something that they are brilliant as such as mechanics, computers or maybe something like art, all that needs to happen is to find your skill._ I'm researching on autism for a play. Can we connect over social media if you feel like it?_ @livvlife¬† How would you classify you, as an autistic, as opposed to the autistic who bites people, urinates and defecates on the wall, and punches themselves in the head all day?  I am not trying to be mean, I am genuinely curious.  Not all autistic individuals engage in the same amount of independence.  Some, if left alone, would simply pass away over time_ I hate the terms ‚Äúhigh-functioning‚Äù and ‚Äúlow-functioning‚Äù all it means is that the people with high-functioning autism don‚Äôt affect other people. Autism is not a line_ Function labels are Outdated_ So do i_ Why?_ Why?_ I thought this video called \"Why Venezuela's inflation rate is so high\" would be a meme compilation._ thats how much sense your comment makes_ Albert. Fucking. Einstein._ Autism is on a spectrum and can range from very mild to severe. Symptoms can also vary and are sometimes pronounced, other times not (partly due to masking). \nIt can be a bit confusing, which is why assessment should be left to qualified professionals.\nHope this helps a bit._ @religiohominilupus5259¬† ¬†ReligioHominiLupus¬† sort of, a friend of mine was autistic so I read up on it a great deal and a lot of countries, even states, have their own definitions, which doesn't make things very clear and certainly restricts help for those who need it. It's sort of like PTSD in that respect; it wasn't even diagnosed for a long time and therefore no treatments were available. Once it became 'a thing' changes started getting implemented but the blurry lines (especially at first) complicated things. \n\nThe simple fact that many still consider autism as a disease underlines a lack of clarity and understanding. The anti-vaccine movement claiming vaccines cause autism comes to mind. Research is still ongoing but a clearer consensus allowing better clarification and identification can go a long way towards optimizing social understanding and options  for autistic people all over, including for professionals, I think._ @DaBlondDude¬† I agree with your assessment. Even professionals still tend to misdiagnose people on the spectrum because symptoms can overlap with other (personality) disorders.\nThis may partly be due to a lack of differential diagnosing though. Just something to keep in mind.\nMore research is definitely needed._ It is not a gift. I have autism and everyday i wish for a cure. I wanted to end my own life when i was 11 years old. I had no friends and my life was abysmal. I got a diagnosis when i was 13, and learned how to socialise. Im ok now but what i went through when i was that young? I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy_ This was awesome and very informative._ Every time I watch one of these talks, I wish the psychiatrists that used to treat me, watched them too. Autism is not a disease, but the people trying to ‚Äúcure‚Äù it, makes it into one. I was never allowed to keep the autism diagnosis that was dangled in front of me, the moment the medical staff noticed, I am above average intelligent. So now I‚Äôm just supposed to be normal, whatever that means, or I‚Äôll be diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic, if I show my emotions to the wrong doctors. Just like he described._ \"How do I know? Because I have autism.\"\nDUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUH, this was obvious. Look at that non-human creature._ I wish more people would understand this. I wish I could be proud and open about it but I am so afraid of people believing all the bullshit that is said about us, and since I heard this stuff all my live again and again I actually started to believe it, and have to unlearn it._ I discovered at age 68 that my children, in their 40s, have autistic traits...how did I not know when they were younger?_ I am an 70 old aspie.  I carry earplugs with me because...sirens, loud music!_ üå∑üåºüåªüå∫üíêüå∏_ I mean ok it's not a disease, but all the things he described seem to lead to a certain degree of suffering (inability to articulate emotions, difficulties with social gatherings etc...). Therefore I don't see what's wrong with trying to prevent autism, albeit once the condition is existent we should find societal solutions to deal with it. But the latter doesn't oppose the former imo._ His choice of words show increased intelligence...üëç guy!_ that a human_ This was an amazing video! And it touched me deeply. Thank you so much! \n\nI have Asperger and I often don't know what to do with the feelings I have. And those loud WOOOOHOOO YESSS!!! is something I do, only if I feel super comfortable with someone. Which is almost never and I only had this with 1 person. In a way it's sad because it also means I can never really be myself and never being able to letting go and be loose. I'm Constantly busy trying to behave \"normal\"\n\nIt's exhausting being multiple people at the same time._ Play @ 1.25 speed_ just a different human huh wow well when we see abnormal we just feel the need to fix but what if we try to learn more about it_ This is great perspective!_ I hate bright lights, loud noises and other overwhelming sensory. I am completely onboard for creating environments that are calm and less stressful._ wHY tHEY STILL HUNTER X HUNTER OST Sound In Intro.\n\n\nP.S> From Gujarat, India._ One of the best TedTalks I've seen. Enlightening, endearing, excellent!  Way to go Ethan!!  Thank you!_ Just ask my teammates_ Just had an apiffani  woohoooooooo  that....._ I feel that this was to short. Indeed there is not that much information about autism, so this was interesting yet still lacking. Would love to hear more about this topic._ I‚Äôm really sorry about your experience‚Äî I imagine it must have been so challenging to live your life mis-identified by the people that you should supposedly be able to trust, and who are supposed to help you. I hope you know that as the years pass, more and more understanding and empathetic mental health workers are popping up. There is more hope now than ever to get proper professional help, whether it‚Äôs in person, or even via online methods like Zoom or Discord. To be honest, I never really got the help I needed through professionals; only through videos like these. But I can empathize with that looming thought that even professional doctors don‚Äôt try to understand you, and because of that, it‚Äôs hard to confide or trust society overall. I saw your videos and it‚Äôs clear that you are a passionate and talented individual with lots to share. I wish only the best for you in finding the connections and community that you can be yourself in (assuming you haven‚Äôt already)! Much love and healing~ ‚ù§Ô∏è_ Hes more human than you anyway_ Below, you said you're on the spectrum too. Your children's traits were probably normal to you, which may be why you didn't notice._ Accurate information on Autism that isn't on the low functioning end of the spectrum likely wasn't available anywhere you could have stumbled on it. I'm in the my low 30's now and my mother didn't figure out what was going on with me until I was 12 in the early 0's despite her actively looking for information most of my life. Even then information wasn't something you would find unless you knew to look for it for quite a few years after that. Autism awareness on the superficial level at least is fairly mainstream now but that is a fairly new thing._ Huge respect.\nI don't have autism or schzofreny or any other mental disorder, i'm just different, like you. BUT i don't pretending to be i'm another person. And people like me with my own. I recommend you to use my tactic as yours. üôèüèª_ Yah I have too asperger autism!üíôüíô_ Learn some basic human nature and you will do fine. And always look people in the eye._ @ahk9838¬† vagueness isnt advice_ @ahk9838¬† Not always. A lot of autistic people have trouble with looking in the eye contact. That doesn't mean we should force them into doing that._ I'm just replying on this comment because I like the comment._ Silviu Florin¬† I agree. I also feel calmer in the countryside_ Restricting the world just so we can fit into the specific enviorement without being offended or sressed is stupid and morally wrong_ @ryanturner5273¬† Yes, I agree. Creating new environments that allow diverse groups of people to reach their potential is much better then restricting what we already have._ Ugh same, its worse for me my sister plays loud music on a speaker every weekend and it streeses me out liie crazy._ I‚Äôm autistic and lemme tell you \n\n\n\n\nOzzy hella good on the radio max volume_ @CindyDUsa-chan¬† that‚Äôs not going to solve the problem dude_ @ryanturner5273¬† agreed_ @ryanturner5273¬† You‚Äôre wrong for thinking there‚Äôs a moral wrong and right. It‚Äôs magic dude, half the things you‚Äôd feel bad about are what society told you you should feel bad about. What we need is to remove all law so everyone and everything can reach its max potential_ @EASFromTheWest¬† That potential would fall drastically without a standardized society. It would backfire._ I get extremly annoyed when opening a loud story of a friend on my phone._ @crisbowman¬† What's that supposed to mean?_ @filipeflower¬† Anarchy favors those who are willing to take from others, thus it would never stay anarchy for very long._ @crisbowman¬† And who said anything about Anarchy?_ @filipeflower¬† Without law there is no system of consistent organization, and those willing to exploit others would aquire power._ @crisbowman¬† I know that, but who mentioned Anarchy here?_ @filipeflower¬† The removal of authority is anarchy. Authority does not require a physical form, nor is law exclusively abstract. The authority becomes law in a lawless state. Thus to remove all law you create anarchy._ @crisbowman¬† Again, who said anything about that? You did, nobody else did._ @filipeflower¬† The user previously tagged implied it. A dangerous gamble._ @crisbowman¬† Who?_ @filipeflower¬† EAS, From The West_ @crisbowman¬† Oh, I totally forgot about that._ @EASFromTheWest¬† \nThe human brain does have a divine influence of right and wrong. When all people in a society exercise their conscience instead of their subconscience they will all agree whether something is moral, tolerable or immoral.\n\nLike if I asked a group of people about bad language, no one would call it \"moral\", they would call it \"tolerable/acceptable\" or \"immoral\", from my view bad language is immoral, then it also depends on our cultures._ @danielmoore4024¬† Thank you for bringing that up._ So glad my work has what they call the zen den, low lights, no noises, and the door is locked so no one can come get you until you are sure you can handle the world again_ I absolutely loathe loud noises. I remember going to a birthday party for a family friend. I ended up surrounded by a bunch of rowdy drunks, and so my mom and her boyfriend(who was especially confused)found me in a barn by myself, headphones on, watching Beastars on my phone. So many voices, so much music, and combined with social awkwardness and no one who really shared my interests, talk about a recipe for disaster. I also brought a Stephen King novel with me just in case this happened._ Nightclubs with bright lights, loud music and tight crowds are designed to give people a feeling of anonymity, being part of a larger group and ecstasy. That's what you need if you want people to dance away their thoughts. However, these are not the only kinds of parties - there are in fact many types. Often smaller more refined parties will have quieter music, more space, and a greater focus on conversation and food. Perhaps these are the kind of parties that someone with autism should attempt to seek out._ I am with you on the creating environments calmer and less stressful. I never expected nor will I expect people to change their own systems and environments (that work for THEM) just because of a condition of a minority of people. To each their own, only there isn't (that I know of) a place FOR the 1% of people on the spectrum that focuses on BUILDING their talents and skills. The current system treats autism like a DISEASE or mental illness that needs to be TREATED or CONDITIONED OUT of society. What a dangerous precedent and/or misunderstanding that perception creates. How would they like it if their BRILLIANT and UNIQUE child was treated like psychopath or scurge on society, when basically they just want to LOVE and BE LOVED for WHO THEY ACTUALLY ARE. Not for what other people WANT them to be. Conditional love IS NOT LOVE. (Period)_ It is my MISSION and GOAL to CREATE such a place._ Sometimes I say sensory overload._ It's wild to me that a comment I made 4 years ago when I was in high school, just trying to figure out how to cope with feeling so lost, scared and overwhelmed, is still getting replies (along with one really bizarre conversation).\n\nTo those of you looking for empathy and kindness, I hear you. Wanting to feel safe and understood is not stupid or morally wrong. Whether you're autistic, anxious, introverted (or something else), you deserve gentleness in your life._ Lets everyone know he can‚Äôt handle loud noises. People cheer lol._ Him now is because of thousands and thousands of therapy, patient, and love. good job :')_ What a wonderfully concise and informative talk. As a fellow autustic person, I really appreciate the bravery it took to do this talk. It's so challenging and draining to fight against these stereotypes and anyone prepared to do that in public is an absolute hero in my book!_ Improving understanding is important for society of different people, such as this Ted talk can achieve.  The foundational attitude remains the same:  we should respect people with autism letting them be who they are, and the first step is to understand them._ I have Asperger's syndrome and it helps me to hyperfocus on my obsession (beatboxing) and now I am able to work for myself and teach online. Brilliant presentation and speech :)\n\n*Edited bcoz of typo_ This wet noodle of a human clearly looks unwell and probably does not get adequate sunlight, sleep, exercise or nutrition. Address these issues before making any self diagnosis._ Autisic=idiot\n\n\n\n\n\n=I_ I've always been fascinated by this. Alternate Point of View and Perspective on the here and now. Intriguing._ Can i have used this tedx videos  for my you tube channel by translating in my own language? Because lots of people where i am living with are not understand english with subtitle as well so can i use it? so lots of people will utilize it._ I have a friend this way or similar... Doesn't think like I do at all, more like stream of consciousness when he speaks.  I appreciate his viewpoint on things._ If you really want to really see open an XQC stream and look at chat._ I've never related this much to a TED talk. His problems are the same as everybody else's, but more. People that look similar to him get stereotyped, he has a few topics he obsesses about, people that don't think like him want to find a \"cure\" for that way of thinking, he needs a positive self talk when he looks at the mirror, the world isn't build for them, he gets overwelmed by overstimulation specially in large parties, he feels the need for fidgeting when he gets anxious, he has to mask his own feelings in order to feel accepted, doing homework at night makes him very tired, if he doesn't expresses his true self he feels ashamed for masking, he is not good at showing empathy and if a friend tells him his struggles he doesn't know how to reply, emotional expression is hard for him because if he expresses his emotions to their full extent he might get labeled as weird, sometimes he says things thinking he might help his interlocutor remember a shared experience and when they get confused he has to elaborarse himself on that, he wants the world to be designed to work better for people like him, he is not ashamed, and he is human. \nI'm glad he got to give a TED talk. I have a friend with autism that can barely speak and I would love the world to be a more welcoming place for everybody. \nThanks for reading this far. This took me way more than 9 minutes to write. \n\nI hope you are having a great day._ @TED how can we attend ted talks online ????_ Bless you for this._ Look into the correlation between gut health and autism! May be worth looking into for some of you that are wanting to help relieve someone of their symptoms_ Autism ultimately boils down to: you have a condition which makes it difficult for you to manage your life, and I can't keep doing it for you. It's a fantastic condition FOR life, but not IN life._ Excellent!!!!. I admire you. I come from VN_ He still looks and sounds like he described.. lol.. Good video, though!_ Yes. I agree._ üëèüèø_ Lol_ Same disappointment/exhaustion I feel when I watch videos made by youtubers in the autistic community and the intro or outro is LOUD or there is music playing during their video and I cannot hear them. Auditory Processing is a huge aspect of my personal struggle, being on the spectrum._ Well yes, but he probably also understands and appreciates the intent._ As would I, but that‚Äôs why I bring earplugs lol_ @Cornelius Esperanza It was funny and weird how they did it the same way the second time. But I'm pretty sure he also wants to be treated normally and doesn't mind it in such a short burst and understands that everything shouldn't cater to him to such an extreme._ To be fair, expected loud noises are much easier. It's the unexpected ones (or ones with negative associations) which are really bad. Loud noises with positive associations can be an auditory bath of comfort._ Nah those loud noises are fine. They‚Äôre expected. It‚Äôs stuff like walking down the street and suddenly an ambulance siren fires up out of nowhere. That‚Äôs a day ruiner._ I want to say that my noise canceling headphones changed my life. Best decision I've made in the past year._ 5¬† \nMeltdowns are not immediate reactions, nor is over/under-sensitivity.\n\nMeltdowns occur when their brain has overloaded, when it cannot accept anymore information that's being sensed. Often described as \"shut down completely, there was no getting through\".\n\nOver and under-sensitivity is a reaction to overstimulation. Autistic people including myself are more sensitive to stimulus, while others select what information to pay attention to, the attention of autistic people is on the entire environment, both relevant and irrelevant information. When they become overstimulated the brain reacts._ @danielmoore4024¬† Thank you for bringing that up._ @filipeflower¬† \nI can chat with you by email._ @danielmoore4024¬† Ok. I already gave you my email._ @filipeflower¬† \nIs it on the other thread?_ @danielmoore4024¬† Yes. Not the one with that \"you know who\" troll, but the one where I actually wrote down my email. Check your email inbox if you want to find out where it is._ @filipeflower¬† \nIf you're talking of \"Plato\", the thread with 107 responses, it hasn't shown._ Omg üò≥ poor guy ü§£ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫_ @meagain1112¬† \nDo you think you're a \"normal person\"?_ @meagain1112¬† \nThe shameful truth about you so called \"normal people\" is;\n\nNormal People = Abnormal People\n\nNormal People = Division among the human race.\n\nDivision = Discrimination, Cultural Prejudice, Racism and Conflict.\n\nA divided race cannot stand, you are the creators of these offences as well as commit them._ @danielmoore4024¬† Did that user you were talking to deleted his/her comments?_ @filipeflower¬†  \nIt looks like it._ Dr Yuching Lee¬† You expect us to believe that?_ üíÄüíÄüíÄ_ @007rosin¬† it is still funny._ @Jedindy¬† amen to that_ Fr. That was a poorly prepared episode for this young man._ Of course. If only more people realized that..._ Donkey I'm probably just triggered because I see some of my former self in this wet noodle and I don't want people operating under the delusion that being sensitive to loud noises and bright lights constitutes some kind of mysterious disorder. People are eating garbage, they're not getting enough sunlight, exercise or sleep, and they spend half the day on their phone, Netflix or playing video games. Add to that all the toxins and chemicals people are exposed to and it's no wonder our children are becoming increasingly incapable of thriving in the real world._ @DegreesOfThree¬† you. You have a lot of anger in you. Far to much for me to throw reasoning against. I've tried. Please calm down and stop commenting on these types of videos. We're fine without your... \"Help\". And if you can't, please be more considerate of your readers. To us, all your comments read as: \"you are and Ill piece of garbage and you should be ashamed of yourself. Get some exercise!\" And that's really not nice to read. You seem to try to start a logical argument with fair reasoning but I think your motives are far more emotional and personal. At least you are passionate about what you do, like many autistic people. \nAnd you did in fact almost inspire me to live a little healthier in these times of isolation. But just your toxic personality made me not want to do it, just to spite you. \n\nPlease stop harassing us.\n~kind regards,\nJochem._ Are you against autism or are you okay with it?_ @filipeflower¬† Does it matter? The fact is that it is a thing and we have to accept and support people who have it (just the same as we have to accept and support anybody else)_ @LucasDanielSantoro¬† Oh, so we're on the same side then. Good to know._ Landon - Gut health, but also vitamin deficiency, sunlight deficiency, sleep deficiency, and exercise deficiency are also worth looking into. A combination of some or all of the above could create a spectrum of symptoms which could easily be mistaken for a nebulous and poorly defined disease like autism._ The whole point of the speech is that autism ISN'T a disease... üòì_ @DegreesOfThree¬† Are you saying autism is a disease? I mean, were you even watching this video?_ @filipeflower¬† It's not a contagious disease, but it's technically classified as a neurological developmental disorder. Definitely not something to be celebrated or normalized as it can easily bankrupt families who have to pay for expensive therapies and interventions._ @DegreesOfThree¬†  That's the wrong interpretation of it. I am autistic myself, but my family never went bankrupt because of that.\nBy the way, have you spoken to multiple doctors about that issue?_ @DegreesOfThree¬† You forgot to reply to this one and yet you replied on another thread. Goes to show you're just trolling._ That depends on the person, really. For example, autism didn't stop me from getting the ultimate job and a girlfriend._ Brave young man for sure!!:)_ Being human is spectral_ My son's name Ethan, he has Asperger's and also has long hair! This young man reminds me of him._ One if my sons is autistic.\nHe is the mist loving and caring boy i ever have.\nAnd at times, i need to response to his repeated questions and story books that i need to read to him uncountable times, sing a song non-stop for half an hour repeatedly.\nHe sees beauty in a very small thing. At the same time very creative. \nAutistic people are special human being with gifts and special hearts!! üíïüíïüíï_ Very brave of you Ethan! It must have been difficult for you to be in a small room with so many people, so close to you, clapping loudly. But you did it and you did it really really well! Congratulations and thank you!_ You seem normal._ A powerful presentation!_ huge presentation, excelent delivery_ Thank you Ethan!_ I found out that I was autistic at the age of 50. At least now I know why I got beat up so much in high school!_ Love his hair. I really liked this Ted Talk._ I am a female with autism.  I am a very nice person, very thoughtful and sensitive.   But I have had to learn empathy in some forms.  I used to be a flirt, not understanding why it was so inappropriate.  i suffered consquences, and feel guilty thinking about saying things like that again.  \n\nPeople would act uncomfortable, but not say anything.  I couldn't read their body language, so I didn't know.  Then, they would yell at me and say how inappropriate it was.  When I would say I didn't know, they would act like I was playing dumb and act even more mad.  But fortunately I can read people now and that problem is resolved.\n\nI am grateful for people that understand me.  I always want to grow and learn.  Sometimes the hard way is the only way to learn things._ awesome talk._ Extremes or nothing. Very true._ As a special education/early childhood teacher since the days of segregation, when I insisted on having an integrated classroom of children, I have personally debated the issue of how much a child needed to \"conform to the norm\" and how much behavior should be accepted as long as not disruptive to the learning environment. All children have different strengths, weaknesses and learning styles. Children in my classroom might be laying on the floor under a table working independently, standing up during a circle group activity, wearing earplugs/buds playing music or blocking sound, etc. This hasn't always been completely approved by some principals, but most parents are OK because they see the positive effects! THERE IS NO NORMAL! NORMAL IS BORING. EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT! Faster the world accepts this, the better the world will be!_ Thank you. I have an autistic son and hearing this TED talk felt like I‚Äôm listening to my son from the future describe himself._ Call it.. Vaccine damage._ Wow was watching videos about autism and then this shows up in my notifications. Was needed thank you ü§ç_ I believe autism is a gift!_ Very well said!!!_ We get that a lot and it makes us both mildly content with out masking abilities and really really sad about how much effort it cost and how we can't really express ourselves in a society that doesn't understand us_ There is no such thing as normal._ Your point?_ @monkewithinternetaccess6107¬† I think it's pretty obvious. Normal doesn't apply to just one thing only._ I only care about his hair in that it kind of reminds me of Weird Al Yankovic._ @ContentConfessional¬† I think I am better at communicating in some ways because I had to consciously think about it._ \"I always want to grow and learn.  Sometimes the hard way is the only way to learn things.\r\"\nThat completely describes me as a autistic person, I just wish everyone believed it._ @kakoolie6947¬† I assumed every autistic person went through what I went through.  But I learned some people don't realize it's their problem and they need to fix it.  That is the point when we are allowed to judge in my opinion._ It's not inappropriate to flirt... Be careful with what people tell you to do._ @Nekotaku_TV¬† I know that now.  If I have a professional relationship with someone now and want to give them a gift I ask if it's appropriate and explain sometimes I cannot tell.  But trust me my social skills are a lot better._ @Nekotaku_TV¬† That depends on the context, you know._ Same_ I can't tell you how angry this makes me.\nSpecially when it comes to women, society tends to punish spontaneousness and ask for some pretty fucked up levels of masking by default. That's what's innapropiate imho. You know, for all the difficulties around expressing one's feelings; in these instances I really think the problem lies within the rest of society. I mean, I can see how it is really hard on the people suffering it; but is lacking the hability to automatically pick up mind numbing levels of alienation a bad thing?  I don't think so._ @elenavacas9003¬† well said!_ @elenavacas9003¬† \nThe mythical belief of \"normal people\" is the problem.\nWe're taught we're supposed to learn from our mistakes by so called \"normal people,\" which is pretty ironic as history shows us where there's \"normal people,\" discrimination, oppression, cultural prejudice, racism and conflict lurks.\n\n\"Normal people\" can't seem to learn from their mistake of applying normality to that which has no normality._ Hi Goobian, I am researching on Autism for a play. Can we connect over social media if you feel like sharing anything about it?_ I would find it a lot easier to read other people's emotions if they didn't spend the vast majority of their time hiding their emotions.  I have no trouble reading the emotions of animals because they express what they actually feel._ Goobian, whomever yelled at you for flirting was wrong! Flirting may be inappropriate at times but yelling at someone is so much worse! Too many \"normal\" people behave like jerks unfortunately._ This happen to me sooo often, sadly that just made avoid people/stay quiet/ imitate other people behavior. I am grateful for my husband because he is only person I can be 100% myself. And it is nice to say things without calculating every word._ @jennagarcia1043¬† Jenna, you're very lucky to have found a good man üíï_ I am so glad you guys are willing to openly talk about this. My daughter is 5 years old and I came to the conclusion that she has autism only days ago. I'm still coping with it but seeing these comments helps me a lot and is most importantly going to help her. I don't let my wife see me get emotional or at my worst but I'm sobbing typing this. Keep talking about your experiences. Because it's really helping people like me and my daughter._ @Aldinonexilus¬† Danny!!! Sending you my best wishes, autism is a blessing in disguise <3_ @MuskaanSinha¬† This sounds interesting! Can you tell me more about it?_ Even as a guy, I feel that so hard. You ask what you're doing wrong and they can't even comprehend that you don't just 'get it' and think it's some stupid joke._ @mirmarq429¬† mitch, that happens between us neurotypicals too. Human relations are extremely hard even if one doesn't have autism. In my experience, most people don't have enough empathy or intelligence and are too quick to anger and judge others negatively._ I had this same problem as a teenager and I made people uncomfortable and some thought that I was doing this on purpose as a joke or something. While in reality I swear I didn't know what I was doing. I hated myself for it and started avoiding any interactions and it did give me some peace. People are just so fast to make judgements and it's overwhelming_ Keep flirting üòä_ You are one of the heroes that make the world a better place. Don't stop what you are doing and don't let people tell you otherwise!üëç_ My point exactly. Thank you._ I'm so glad you are a teacher!!! I know there are some who think and teach like you, but I wish there were so many more ‚ù§Ô∏è_ @Erica-en2qz¬† TY_ Manuel Guzman Have you had your son's vitamin D levels tested?_ I feel the same way... my 4 yr old son is autistic and non verbal. I needed this! :)_ @DegreesOfThree¬† what exactly are you implying here?_ Bearly Listening What exactly is THAT supposed to mean sport? Please, elaborate_ @jochemgoede5759¬† Watch out for Bearly Listening. He's an anti-autism troll._ I am autistic as well and o find this world really hard_ I know this was a year ago, but as an autistic person, I appreciate you doing your research. So many parents deem it as a bad thing. It‚Äôs simply another brain type_ @Manuel Guzman, as an autistic adult, I take great comfort in knowing there are neurotypical parents who, though concerned about the challenges autism presents, are equally interested in deepening their understanding of what the experience of autism feels like from the inside. People like you make this world easier for us to fit into. We often have a lot to contribute to the world, and with the help of supportive neurotypicals, we have an easier time accomplishing that._ @uptown3636¬† exactly! I‚Äôm autistic too I agree_ I'm 49 and I'm autistic. Found out 2.5 years ago. I spent my whole life feeling like an alien. Now, finally, everything makes sense to me. Give your son unconditional love. Be patient. Explain everything you do or you ask him to do. We need to understand why, how, when...  normal people act the way they do and why, how, when... we're expected to act a certain way. Make sure he understands he's loved the way he is, he's awesome the way he is and that he isn't any better or worse than others just because he's different. Teach him to feel free to tell you when and why he feels overwhelmed and work it through together. If you lose patience, do not lose your temper. Bite your tongue, take some time out and come back when you calm down. Love and support can make miracles. We are a handful but, in most cases, we are utterly honest, trustworthy and loyal. \n\nI suspect that at least 2 of my 3 kids are autistic. I raised them the way I explained above and they're all happy adults, now. I didn't know I was autistic while I was raising them, but I gave them everything I so much needed but never got while I was growing up._ @natasha.r.m¬† Thank you very much for sharing your story.  49 years old.  I can imagine information was not readily available when you were young like it is now.  The good thing is that there were a lot of resources available when we discovered that my son is autistic.  It would have been so much harder for him if he had been born 30 or 40 years earlier.  I‚Äôve learned so much being a parent of my son.  When he was little, I bought him a lot of toys and things that I thought he would be fun based on my childhood.  As he grew, he really took to figuring out how things work and also fixing things.  So for activities, we spend a lot of time learning how things work and updating or repairing things.  So while we may not spend weekends playing sports for example, I would have missed out on so many amazing activities (things that I would have never dreamed that I could do) that we have done together if things would have turned out the way I originally imagined they would.  The great thing is that we are also part of an autism social club and we have met a lot of amazing parents in the process._ @ManuelGuzman¬† I'm so glad to hear that you and your son are having a great relationship and that you're a kind of a parent every child needs. üòä I'm also glad that your son was born in times where resources and useful information are available, so that he can get the support he needs and he can grow up to be the best version of himself. \nI wish him a very happy and fulfilled life. üòäüôèüèª‚ù§_ Same here! I have two little ones as well 7 and 3 üòä listening to TED! ü•∞ had me in happy tears! ü•≤_ I felt this comment with my whole heart ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è_ Exactly the same_ Thank you for this üíô_ No! Why would I ever?!_ No._ ok karen_ Do your research. That study was completely BULLSHIT. The doctor who did it lost his job and is not allowed to work as a doctor ever again._ @itzgamerwolf5899¬† Thank you for bringing that up._ Such an amazing speech ‚ù§Ô∏è!_ Very informative_ unsubbed , learn to have decent topics and not kids who laught at their own topic whilest not even beeing serious... and high at the same time off their meds , its obvious_ That was a great speech Ethan, you are very brave to share and thank you for helping me understand more about autism._ Ethan Lisi, thank you for explaining your perspective and challenges you face.  You gave an outstanding talk.  I cringed when I heard all the noise at the end--for your sake!_ https://youtu.be/mW8_JP4lrAw_ 29 April 2020\r\n\r\nYour presentation is personable and smooth communicating well about your personal experience.\r\n\r\nHuman social activities, in general, operate in norms and herd conformity. It is this habit and pattern that will single out anything that is deviant, especially the less competent individuals on certain criteria. \r\n\r\nAutism thus can be stigmatized as a handicap or illness. There is no need to be stigmatized, as other individuals will have other adversities to deal with in life. Eg. Their body shape, dress or look, etc.\r\n\r\nDon‚Äôt let your physiological condition be your source of self-pity. What counts is your intelligence and a big heart to understand life. Discover that you might have a special talent being yourself.\r\n\r\nThank you for this video._ Do you think being aware of your own autism is socially impairing? Like you're kind of overthinking autism. Please don't be mad, I'm watching this respectfuly and started wondering about this, because yeah, he seems pretty \"normal\" (as in I wouldn't think of autism by looking at or talking to him, just a kind gentle guy). Like, the same way being a introvert is not as accepted as being extrovert, autism is something that defines people that are different, but there is nothing wrong with them, like they are helpless or \"naive\". I don't know if I'm communicating what I mean so well, english is my 2nd language. I mean, autistic people like him just seem to be kinder and more polite and nicer than \"normal\" people? There's nothing wrong with him! I just feel like he lacks energy, maybe, but other than that, he just seems like a kind guy, but more interesting and introverted than average?\n\nBtw, I have no idea if I have autism, but I relate to a lot of things regarding aspergers. I hate loud noises, for example, and I do a few \"weird\" things when I'm anxious, since I was little. But, I dislike thinking too much about this because for a long time I've wondered if I'm weird or something, until I realised I feel normal, the only reason I was worrying was because of other people, that in reality are just as if not more weird, they just know how and care to hide it?_ I have Asperger, to say that it isn't a disease it only partially true. While it isn't contagious or deadly, but it is detrimental to the carrier. Many autistics are unable to live by themselves, lack autonomy and overall are deficient people. My autism is high functioning, so these issues are reduced to a minimum for me.  Make no mistake, autism needs a cure_ You may be considered normal but I don't think I would enjoy you as a presenter in a, let's say, comedy show, you do speak in monotone and we already have Jimmy Fallon. Maybe there'd be demand in nich√© audiences. But generally I don't think it's unreasonable to expect autistic people to be naturally limited to certain career choices._ As someone whom is on the spectrum (Aspergers), I can tell you I am no different than anyone else. \n\nI can remember just about everything I have ever read, and I can repeat it back to you at will. \n\nI throughly enjoy making people laugh, I enjoy making people smile. I can empathize with people and be as patient with them as I possibly can.\n\nEven though I enjoy live rock music, I do have problems with night clubs and large, packed-in crowds. That and I have difficulty socializing in general. I have very close friends I wouldn‚Äôt trade for the world, but I have issues with finding new ones. \n\nWe are human beings, no different than anyone else, except maybe Nazis or People Magazine writers. \n\nWe are the same thing. We‚Äôre just wired different._ 1:08 Someone let one rip._ Part of my autism means that I have auditory processing issues, so when I'm in public I cant bear people talking to me because I'm inadvertently focusing on background noise + when I'm at home I have to watch tv with subtitles on or I cant hear it properly_ Thank You. My grandson has autism, and I am trying to learn as much as possible about it._ The Human spectrum. I like that.\nThank you for your presentation.  A movie that helped me know more or see one way of being autistic is Temple Grandin._ Outstanding._ üëç_ Sorry, I dont have anything against autistic people, but i dont see the point \"socially awkward\" disproven here..._ to stand up on a stage is extremely hard for non autistic people and here he is doing it better than most\ni can assure you this is not easy for him_ My daughter is severely autistic. She cannot care for herself. She cannot verbally communicate. She has severe behaviors. She suffers from extreme anxiety. She has to wear pull-ups (she's 18 yrs old). She suffers from epilepsy. She is on 3 different medications. She has serious gut issues.\n\nAutism has financially ruined our family. I've lost employment. I fell into a deep, dark depression, and felt hopeless. My marriage has suffered. Family, and friends have distanced their selves from us. My daughter's name is Kaden. I would do anything for Kaden to have a normal life. Let's not glorify this debilitating mental illness. Most people with autism are not able to function anywhere near a normal person. God bless this young man for sharing his story, but it is HIS story not all autistic people's story._ Attention seeker._ stfu_ Julia He lacks energy and the emperor has no clothes. Such a simple observation, but very insightful. How does a human lose energy? ...Lack of sunlight, vitamins, protein, sleep, and exercise will produce many of the cognitive effects that he described._ @DegreesOfThree¬† yeah, I mean, he just looks like he lacks energy to me, but is normal? I'm confused. I thought autism was something more \"deep\". This sounds a bit like creating problems that don't exist? I'm so confused._ Julia, from what I can read you seem very vulnerable and confused. Please don't listen to this \"bearly listening\" person, because they are convinced that autism is a disease that can be cured (easily even), and that is a very wrong and dangerous point of view. \nIf you think you might have a form of autism, you might want to look for a place for getting a diagnosis, where you can also find reliable information on the subject. \nJust remember that you are you and having a diagnosis doesn't change that. It can only help you understand yourself more. \nYou're a person like any other on this planet and deserve to be treated and respected as such.\nAutism. Is. Not. A. Disease.\nIt is a part of a person and their mind. It cannot be taken away or given to you. It is a lot of good things and bad things, by understanding them you can make the best out of it.\n(Sorry if this comment is a little personal or intrusive, but I really want to help)_ @DegreesOfThree¬† how do they explain the the aversion of eye contact? And how come people show autistic traits throughout their lives, independent of their daily routine, diet, exposure to sunlight and frequency of physical exercise?_ Jochem Goede The entire nation of Japan avoids eye contact with strangers as a sign of respect. Prolonged eye contact in the primate world is often seen as a sign of aggression and leads to violence. People don't always show the same autistic traits their entire lives. Many parents report immediate changes of behavior or loss of speech after vaccines, and many 'autistic' kids can recover verbal ability after various types of interventions._ @DegreesOfThree¬† \"many parents report\" is not evidence. Where is the scientific study? If this effect is real, then surely there must have been several reliable studies conducted_ @DegreesOfThree¬† Uh, dude, it's already been explainned that vaccines don't cause autism. Stop spreading mis-information._ @filipeflower¬† I'm guessing you don't believe vaccines cause blood clots or Bell's palsy either? I never said vaccines cause autism, I said parents have reported immediate changes in behavior and loss of speech after their children were vaccinated._ @DegreesOfThree¬† Okay, sorry about the delay. We have no evidence of that thing you talked about._ It's a disorder, not a disease (if you want to go down that path though, it would be an illness, not a disease).\n\nWhile many autistics may be unable to live by themselves, more ARE able to do so.\n\nAnd while I respect your opinion about autism needing a cure, you shouldn't generalize it. Please don't speak for all of us, because many of us don't feel it needs a cure.\nThanks._ No, man. No cure needed. Also wouldn't be possible, except for killing us._ That's your opinion, but the fact is...autism has no cure, because it's not a disease, but a neurodiversity. Think about it._ @filipeflower¬† it's a disability. That's like saying down syndrome or schizophrenia is \"neurodiversity\"._ @jochemgoede5759¬† not yet. Hopefully one day. To say no cure needed is like saying paraplegics are better off staying crippled_ @religiohominilupus5259¬† wrong, most are unable to function without proper supervision or assistance_ @kekzealot3568¬†  You need to study more accurately about it. The National Health System from the U.K. should be a good start._ @filipeflower¬† really? What knowledge am I missing exactly? Statistically, autism is a severe neurological disability which makes most autists to find a job, live on their own or form romantic relationships. In the worst cases, they literally have panic attacks from loud noises or crowds. In what way is it not an ill that should be cured?_ @kekzealot3568¬† Did you even bother reading that web page I told you about?_ @filipeflower¬† probably did. Do you have a coherent argument you want to bring forth against my statement ?_ @kekzealot3568¬† Dude, right now, I have my job to go to. But in the meantime, you can research about Autism on that web page (NHS UK). It explains what Autism is like._ @filipeflower¬† I'm well aware what autism is. I'm asking you if there is anything I said that is untrue? All evidence points to the fact that I did not fib_ @filipeflower¬† read and watch about raising autistic children and caring for autist adults. In every since of the word, they are cripples who are Ill adapted for society_ @kekzealot3568¬† Yes, there are multiple things actually. But I won't answer until you answer me first. Did you actually read that web page yes or no? \"Probably\" doesn't count as an answer._ @filipeflower¬† send me a proper link, not a wild goose chase. I'll give it a thorough read only after you try to attempt to refute actual facts. I've seen autists. Sad sight. People who claim they do no need a cure are the same who think down syndrome is the next stage in human evolution_ @kekzealot3568¬† So have you read it already?_ @filipeflower¬† 1, still waiting for the link. 2, still waiting for you to refute any of my points. 3, watch the videos I told you about_ @kekzealot3568¬† I already explainned why I can't share links directly. You have to find that yourself. I even gave you instructions.\nAlso, you never showed me any video._ @kekzealot3568¬† By the way, the term \"Asperger's\" is outdated now. More evidence of your ignorance._ @jochemgoede5759¬† That guy thinks he's right in everything, even though there's evidence online (and offline) that explains why he's wrong. He's just lazy and instead acts like he has the authority to demand others to do his work for him._ Normal people can't remember everything they have read and read it back at will._ @michaelrea8090¬† neither can autistic people. btw, the term \"normal people\" when talking about nonautistic people can be a little harmful, I prefer to use \"neurotypicals\" because it's descriptive and sounds as much like a disease as autism does._ @jochemgoede5759¬† I have nothing against anyone! I consider a normal/average person to have no physical or mental defects. Do you know what the word normal means? Or do you just love being offended?_ @michaelrea8090¬† there's a huge difference between \"normal\" and \"average\"_ @Michael Rea the point of this is that autism isn‚Äôt a defect. i get you might have meant no ill will but that is hurtful_ @michaelrea8090¬† You do realize the word \"normal\" is subjective, right?_ @michaelrea8090¬† use the term neurotypical not normal_ lol_ Steph R-T, thank you for explaining what that's like for you.  It sounds hard._ If there is no firm set of symptoms that define autism, what point is there to even using the word? Perhaps the word autism should be replaced with the term 'cognitive abnormality.'_ @DegreesOfThree¬† there are indeed no defined symptoms of autism, but the inner workings of autistic people' s minds are quite consistent between people. The overall picture is hypersensitivity, trouble communicating and understanding communication and a lot of coping mechanisms, anxiety and depression that stem from social isolation, bullying and forcing yourself to \"fit in\".\nUnder the term \"cognitive abnormality\" would fall all the SDS, and many more; probably the majority of people would be included.\nBut autism is very different from other mental conditions, and has distinguishing features. That's why I'm sorry to say that I don't think your generalisation would be a good idea._ @jochemgoede5759¬† Don't listen to that guy. He's a troll. He's been debating a lot already._ That's great_ Thank you for trying to learn and help. So many \"normies\" just regard those of us on the spectrum as \"inferior\". We're not inferior, just different. Our brains are wired differently and things process differently for each of us on the spectrum. I think the one thing so many experts and well meaning people don't know, don't understand, or don't care is that everyone on the spectrum is as different as those not on it._ As someone with autism, I'd like to thank you for taking the time to learn about it. If more people understand autism, we can become a more inclusive society :)_ @brandon3872¬† That's right. If only other people such as \"Bearly Listening\" could learn that._ @brandon3872¬† I want to learn more about autistic people and how to communicate to them, I don't know any autistic person (maybe I know someone who is perfectly masking it) but I want to be able to communicate with an autistic without offending him or making him feel bad.\nI share a lot if things with autistic people like hating loud noises or bright lights and I don't like looking at people in there eye when talking to them which offends some of them (I hate it when people stare at my eyes) so I think I will be fine with them but can't be sure_ Someone can't have autism, autism is the word for the handicap. your grandson is autistic, but doesn't have autism._ epik. trying to learn is rly good_ Thank you, my great grandmother was the one person that understood me, loved me unconditionally, it meant and still means a lot even though she passed away when I was little I still find myself using her care as proof I am good enough, just a warning, there is a good bit of misinformation out there, sometimes the best thing is to ask the person and believe what they tell you, I‚Äôm not sure anyone has ever bothered to ask me what it‚Äôs like when I have a sensory issue_ @andreal3239¬† Thank You. I will make it a point to ask him first, before I assume anything. He is so full of energy._ @justmy2centsful¬† that‚Äôs great! Also keep in mind it may not be easy to explain, but if they need to do something or do something a certain way, they most likely do need that even if they can‚Äôt tell you why or how_ @bassam_salim¬† \nWhen communicating with autistic people you need to be specific and direct in what you mean when communicating verbally.\n\nAutistic people can understand language better when spoken step by step, one thing at a time. Like the format of an instruction manual to putting a table together where the whole task is broken down into steps.\n\nIt's wise to avoid using unverbal communication and give people on the spectrum more time to process the information. Those of us on The Autism Spectrum are anchored to all the stimulus around us which is why we are more easily overstimulated and see, hear, smell, feel etc. the things others are unconscious of. \n\nDon't make any assumptions about them, don't judge us and we won't judge you just like here, you haven't judged autistic people and no autistic person has judged you._ @qi6303¬† says someone with no name_ @qi6303¬† I don't think that is correct.  People are given the diagnosis of autism disorder, just like any disorder.  You wouldn't call a person an ADHD.  If the individual exhibits behaviors that, under the DSM, are commonly associated with autism, the individual has autism._ @pardonmyfrench4760¬† \nThe majority of us refer to ourselves and would appreciate it if you would refer to us as autistic people.\nAccording to The National Autistic Society itself, the majority of autistic people see their autism as a fundamental aspect of their identity.\n\nI certainly do, my autism makes me, me._ @danielmoore4024¬† I definitely agree with your comment. I'm really bad at following directions and I often need people to be extra specific when explaining something to me. It's caused people to get frustrated with me and I really hate it._ Hey do you want to buy audio books and PDF books.\n1 USD for one book_ Its weird because i have autism, and i love being on stage and performing._ My son has autism he started being in plays at 14, he ended up being the main character. He said it helped him to express himself. But yeah it was hard._ Bella Crafts Same. I feel like, when I‚Äôm doing some sort of public speaking, I don‚Äôt have to worry about all the nuances of a casual conversation, and I just have to say what I came to say, and the audience is expected to listen and show respect. If anything, getting to speak in front of a crowd is kinda fun for me._ My brother Is autistic and he is just so natural when he has to perform or talk in public whereas I am a huge mess struggling with anxiety_ @bellac6311¬† Yes! Me too. Being on a stage is far easier than talking to people one on one._ its like you watched the talk but the point missed you completely_ Well it depends \nsome like me are verry extroverted\njust yesterday I was riding around for hours practecing yodeling \nlitturally everyone was starting at me one guy even shouted at me i couldnt tell what he said??\nbut i didnt mind \nits never bothered me what anyone thinks of me_ How can u assure us?_ Most people have fear of public speaking. I don‚Äôt imagine it matters if you are or aren‚Äôt autistic._ I would quite literally rather die than speak in front of an audience. And no, I‚Äôm not using the word ‚Äúliterally‚Äù in the butchered, overused, meaningless way most people these days use it. If I were told to give a speech or die, I would choose LITERAL death without a second thought._ Sharon Jensen you don‚Äôt understand. I‚Äôve tried speaking in groups. The largest was a group of about ten people. I opened up my mouth to speak, my speech written in front of me, and I could feel myself shaking, sweating, my limbs went completely numb, heart was pounding, and my throat tightened to the point where when I tried to speak, my voice wouldn‚Äôt come out. I ended up having a full panic attack despite the fact that I‚Äôm even medicated for my social anxiety. Trust me when I say from experience that I would rather die than try that again. I still have nightmares about it. I know for most people, facing your social fears helps. But for me it‚Äôs a different beast completely. My social anxiety is so bad that it takes control of my entire body._ Bella Crafts Same here! I‚Äôm very good at giving presentations. I‚Äôm currently studying to become an Attorney. This really shows how wide the spectrum is._ Coraville I‚Äôm not saying that. I‚Äôm saying that fear of public speaking is one fear we all have in common. Fear or no fear, you can also enjoy it, autistic or not autistic.  Not sure how you got from ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt imagine it matters if you are or aren‚Äôt autistic‚Äù to ‚Äúautistic=can‚Äôt enjoy public speaking‚Äù._ @bellac6311¬† I have autism and I was always the speaker in presentations at both school and college. It's funny how even though we supposedly have the same disorder, it still manifests in completely different ways. It's something a lot of people forget, and is also what causes a lot of confusion because people think after interacting with one autistic person, they've interacted with them all and that's just not the case._ talking on stage for me is easier than the back and forth of conversation._ @benstephens34¬† A qualified Doctor would disagree wit that._ To be fair, presenting is hard for everyone. But being autistic means you're more aware of that communication challenge and you can work with the details to overcome it._ What makes you so assured that this is not easy for him?_ It's pretty easy being autistic and being on stage and performing since nearly every social interaction feels like a performance or big presentation. If anything, more people is easier for me since I don't need to actually pay attention to anybody in particular and it's almost like nobody is there.\n\nThat's just me though, I'm sure others feel differently._ Hmm I think thats true for some autistic people but you should not assume thats the case for all_ Literally I'm getting anxiety for him just watching him talk. I am terrified of public speaking_ @EASFromTheWest¬† \nIn autistic brains there's additional activity in the \"amygdala\", where the \"fight or flight\" hormone functions which is why autistic people get anxious more easily.\n\nThe other thing that makes it difficult is it's not easy to speak a foreign language while on stage, it can be said autistic and nonautistic people speak two separate versions of the same language which is why there's so much misinterpretation.\n\nIt's not easy for an autistic person to speak the nonautistic way. Just like my dad taught me the nonautistic way, I teach parents the autistic way so both can try and speak in a way that makes sense to the other, if you haven't heard of it, it's called the double empathy problem._ @bellac6311¬†  i fucking hate it lul. im also autistic btw_ @tristantheoofer2¬† And thats totally fine! Its called a spectrum for a reason, right :)_ @bellac6311¬†  tbh autism to me is like a color wheel lol. u have teh same symptoms but severities of dat symptom yeeeeee_ @tristantheoofer2¬† i like to visualise it as just a dj booth thing with tones of dials, and everyone dials are set to different intensities and stuff. If its a bad day, my sensory issues dial will turn up, for example. But i like the colour wheel theory too!_ I mean you aren‚Äôt him so how do you know. Sure when the crowd cheered he might of had a hard time but every person is different_ Greta Thunberg gave truly outstanding TEDx talk in Stockholm on Saturday 24 November 2018 on the climate crisis. She bravely IDs as an OCD-Asperger's person and recognizes its positive aspects._ The guys who type here in the comment section , do you guys all high functioning or been diagnosed as level 2 or 3 as kids please can some one reply_ @walidsarwary¬† \nThe truth is there's actually no such things as high and low-functioning, these functioning labels are actually a big problem. The Autism Spectrum is multidimensional, what those described as high-functioning can't do, low-functioning can do. Trying to fit an entire spectrum of people into three categories has actually left a lot of people on the spectrum with no help or support.\n\nAutism is developmental, it doesn't stay the same for the individual's entire life. As the brain neurodevelops the autism develops with it, autism is neurological, not behavioural. That's why later in life some difficulties reduce and some increase, like tolerances of stimuli develop and the brain becomes more settled that sensory issues don't seem as severe or regular. This is just one of the reasons so many adults are undiagnosed, now that their brain's developed so much it's not so easy to see the traits._ @tristantheoofer2¬† \nEveryone has difficulties and challenges in life including people who are not classified as disabled at all.\n\nFrom what I perceive, I would rather have the difficulties autism gives me than the difficulties I see others have. I can safely assume you know financial issues are some of the most common challenges, I have no financial issues whatsoever only because I'm autistic. If I were not autistic and epileptic I would have to take upon myself a full-time job and will have more bills to pay.\nWhat makes you think you would find a nonautistic life easier than an autistic life?\n\nYou're writing as if you think nonautistic people have easy lives with no challenges._ Performing is different than socializing.  It‚Äôs scripted and you know what‚Äôs coming._ Unless it is lol I have students in the spectrum who love being the center of attention depends on their personality_ It‚Äôs not weird you are not weird. Everyone in the spectrum is different._ why would you know?_ @Yakarash¬† me too -too!\n‚ù§_ @heartsmyfaceforever8140¬† Are you saying he wasn't being honest?_ Idk if that is true I have autism and notice no difference when talking in large crowds_ Not all autistic people find it hard to speak on front of a group. Preparation is key and knowing your subject ._ @dorianaaronson9602¬† Autism differs from person to person._ @dorianaaronson9602¬† I find it much easier to speak on stage than I do making small talk with a stranger or even acquaintance.  \n So ya , autism makes some things hard ,social things... but honestly groups of people don't bother me , its individual persons that I have issues with . \n Seems I'm not alone ,other autistic people feel that way too .\n‚ù§_ @bellac6311¬† yeah i was gonna say, its a piece of cake._ Maybe non-autistic people get overwhelmed with feelings at that moment, and since autistic people deal with those feeling all the time,they have better control over themselves in these kinds of situations_ @bellac6311¬† Same._ i have autism but i honestly hate being on stage_ I've never had issues with performing:/_ @bellac6311¬† I like getting spotlight too when I know I‚Äôm welcome I have been treated like autism poster child_ He rubbed his hands on his pants a couple times to remove sweat_ I can't quite agree with that. Autism is quite a broad thing. Symptoms vary._ he's doing awesome!!! I have ADHD and I wouldn't be able to perform with this clarity and greatness_ @benstephens34¬† i believe it does. ive raised a lot of kids. my 3 year old has been diagnosed. my whole approach to parenting is different with him. communication so far is the biggest hurdle. therefore communicating on stage to a room full of people has to be tough im sure_ ‚Äã¬†@MyMomo17¬†it is play pretendüòä_ ‚Äã@bellac6311 there's different levels, everyone's autism is different. ‚ù§_ Not all autistic people have social anxiety. I‚Äôve known people on the spectrum that could talk to anyone, anywhere, for hours on end without even thinking about it lol. Meanwhile I‚Äôm not on the spectrum, but I sweat and twitch if I have to speak to a group of people._ I have autism and I know its hard for him. The way he presents is exactly how I would.. I actually bet he practiced this speech countless times and checked a bunch of times if he's about to say smething wrong_ You mean for autistic people_ I feel for you and your daughter, Straw Man.  Hope things get easier and you can get some help.  Please be well.  It's hard being \"the strong one\" on your own.  I say this even though you said you're married..._ People like you are the reason I cannot stand autistic parents sometimes. You decided to have a child knowing they might be disabled and are now talking about your daughter as a burden. And saying that autism is a debilitating mental illness. It is a neurodevelopmental disorder. And it is a spectrum of various traits. No one is glorifying autism but many of us have something different to bring to the table. Also many people on the spectrum CAN function with a little help or not at all. To say most is completely false. Your experience with your daughter is just one. Yet you are trying to use it to say that most of us are like that. We are not we are all different. Maybe many of us can‚Äôt live a ‚Äúnormal life‚Äù (whatever thats supposed to mean. But we can bring a totally different perspective and revolutionize industries. Look at Nikola Tesla or Temple Grandin. My autism makes me a talented mathematician and philosopher. When you expect so little of autistic people, you‚Äôre not even giving us a chance to try. Maybe listen to the experiences of autistic people instead of projecting the issues you have with your daughter on others._ I'm sorry to hear that about your daughter. Though it does sound like she is on the severe end of the spectrum and has an accompanying learning _disability_, which is still not a mental illness. \n\nAutism is a learning difficulty. I have Asperger's, which means I am high functioning and have no learning disability but do have learning difficulties. \n\nI believe the definition of learning disabilities vs learning difficulties is that a learning difficulty (unlike learning disabilities) do not affect one's overall IQ. \n\nDespite still having an average to above average IQ I still do struggle alot with day to day life. I believe that only 15% of people with Asperger's are in full time employment._ @auberjean6873¬† thank you. Not all is bad. I love my family unconditionally. I've learned so much from my daughter. She has strengthen my passion for others, and solidified the need to identify the important, meaningful things in life. Best wishes to you as well. ‚ù§_ @calleinad¬† a normal life is: an individual who has the  ability to completely care for themselves.\n\nAutism is a wide spectrum. I think it is important to discuss all aspects of the subject to the layman in order for there to be a fair understanding of not just the good in a diagnosis of the autistic \"label\", but the struggles of the individual as well as the people (family, friends, care givers) who are affected. That is my point. \n I don't need sympathy or anyone to feel sorry for Kaden. It just seems fair to mention both ends of the spectrum. There are so many other topics of concern regarding parental care, and decisions, that I cannot possibly cover in this comment section. I wish that i could. However, I will mention one: what is the cause of autism? Take care._ Glad to hear it,¬†@Strawman333¬†.  May you and your family stay well in these uncertain times. Best wishes._ @Strawman333¬† Look, whoever you are, you can't blame autism as a whole just because you had one bad experience. And if your so-called friends ditched you, that's their fault, not yours or your daughter's. And if you don't need sympathy, then what was the point of bringing up your story in the first place?_ Every human is different and it is natural! Non-autistics should learn more so that we can truly understand each other. Thanks for sharing the new world._ Inspirational song with quotes about autism by autistic man\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=httX_XhNQhw_ Great talk!_ I feel like this title is a great meme waiting to happen_ Good points raised, but at first I thought that he was joking when he started off saying that many people think of the autistic as white men with pale skin who speak in a monotone. Well..._ what about the part where autistic people go to Vegas and count cards in an 8-deck Black Jack game?   what is your special power?_ I am writing a book with the main character having high functioning autism(Asperger's). I hope you will like it. I am really putting my everything into it._ Jesus is coming back soon.  There is No Greater Love than to lay down your life for another. üíï_ Our friends with autism have very beautiful hearts. They do not harm nature and other living beings like us. I would like to be proud of such people. Life is beautiful with them.‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§_ Thank you for this insightful video. It's a shame that nasty children (who're oft eager to mock before thinking) corrupt and desensitize the meaning of medical diagnostic terms. Worse still, they spread their insulting misunderstandings in an attempt to appear smarter than their peers. \n\n\nPeople need to realise that children have an unsettling amount of influence on society via the web, as well as in the classroom. The sooner they are corrected and reprimanded for hostile intentions, the better for society as a whole. And perhaps there will be a decrease in [traumatized] people; who later develop psychological issues, e.g. anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts after highschool._ What I'd like to know is, does one have autism, or is one autistic? Or both. Thank you._ I didn't watch the video yet, but damn he has nice hair!!!_ –î–æ–ª–≥–æ–ø–æ–ª–æ–≤?—Ç–∞–∫ –≤–æ—Ç –∫—É–¥–∞ —Ç—ã —Å–≤–∞–ª–∏–ª..._ I love this Ted Talks. I work with them and my nephew and aunt and many others are awesome wonderful people. They need to be treated better. Heck I have cerebral palsy, none of us are the same either. Autism awareness for all!_ Yeah, the disease/disability part comes from the fact that autistic people struggle to cope with certain things that non-autistic people don't. People who claim autism isn't a disorder are just refusing to accept the fact that the term disorder is only meant to denote that these people experience difficulties that people without their condition do not. It's not useful to deny reality. It is useful to acknowledge that people with autism frequently have special needs. To deny autism is a disorder is to deny the fact that autistic people have struggles that they need help with. If it's NOT a disorder then there's nothing wrong, and if there's nothing wrong then there's no need to do anything different to help them with their struggles, because there obviously is no problem if there is no disease._ Well done!_ Iam autistic, my father is autistic, my grandmo... Well my ancestors lived a plain nomadic lifestyle for centurys in the always looking same steppes of central asia. What was autism again? My theorie is that autism is just reprogramming of the brain to fit the environment._ He‚Äôs so cute_ Watching this video has made me feel autistic and I would like my 9 minutes and 52 seconds back please .therefore I feel of full refund should be given_ Glad we got some representation that wasn't a miscommunication because of discrimination.  It's a relief, especially because of all the stereotypes which are not exactly wrong but not exactly right._ @Donkey , I thought about my comment a great deal before hitting \"send\". I acknowledged that the young man had made valid points in his presentation. I merely pointed out the irony in the fact that almost the very first traits that the speaker asserts are stereotypical are ones that he himself embodies. White male? Check. Pale skin? Check. Speaks in a monotone? Check. I am in no way asserting that these traits are, in and of themselves wicked, ridiculous, nor much less, worthy of censure. \n\nIn this talk the speaker says that he hates loud noises. At points subsequent to this statement the audience applauds, that is, they make a loud noise. Someone in this very thread comments on this little irony. Was that commenter implying that the audience was wickedly tormenting this young man? No, I think that the commenter was merely pointing out one of the little absurdities that cross our paths every day. But this is precisely what I was doing, nothing more.\n\nDonkey, our interaction here is a reflection of something that happens a million times a day online, and is important to understand correctly, which is why I have gone on at such length. I commend your willingness to step forward and oppose unjust, harmful words. The problem is that we can see the words of others online, but we cannot see their hearts. But I've gone on too long already._ @DegreesOfThree¬† please don't use such offensive language when talking about people on the spectrum_ @DegreesOfThree¬† You must have a prejudice against autism. That's your problem._ @filipeflower¬† That's like saying I'm prejudiced against cancer patients, because I want to find a cure for cancer._ @DegreesOfThree¬† Wrong, because autism and cancer are two different things. Just because you don't like it, doesn't mean you should discriminate it, in the same way we no longer discriminate homossexuals or people with different races.\nI happen to be autistic myself and still I managed to get a job that pays me well, even during state of emergency. Not to mention I also happen to have a girlfriend. Do you think autism prevents this? It doesn't. Welcome to the 21st century._ @filipeflower¬† Just because you might be socially inept, doesn't make you autistic. I'm not talking about Asperger's. I'm talking about severely disabled people that can barely function or even speak. Discrimination is the basis for all knowledge and is extremely useful. For example, we need to be able to discriminate between a friendly kitten and a mountain lion, if we want to survive in the wild. We also need to be able to discriminate between a personality quirk and severe neurological impairment, if we are going to find the underlying cause of autism._ @DegreesOfThree¬† Excuse me, but I happen to be autistic in fact. I already have my Doctor's report and you still think you can claim otherwise? You're not really an expert on this field, are you?\n\nAnd if you promote discrimination, then you're definitely not a good person. Do you also discriminate homosexuals and people with different skin color? Same concept really._ @DegreesOfThree¬† By the way, the term \"Asperger's Syndrome\" is no longer valid. Which is evidence that your supposed knowledge is kind of oudated. I suggest you talk to a qualified Doctor about it._ @filipeflower¬† Discrimination is not optional in the US. It is mandatory. People of European and Asian descent are discriminated against every day in college admissions and hiring. This is called affirmative action. It is the law. This is why clowns like Elizabeth Warren claim imaginary Native American ancestry.\nI never said I was an expert on autism, but I have a degree in biology and was previously diagnosed with Asperger's, which is one of the ways I know it's nonsense. If you really think you have some kind of neurological impairment, then I suggest you measure your glyphosate level. If you don't think autism constitutes any type of impairment, then why make the distinction at all?_ @DegreesOfThree¬† Well, here's some news for you. I happen to be from another country. So your silly U.S law doesn't apply to me.\nI met people who studied autism much longer than you (supposedly) have and one of those used to be my Boss. Not to mention that our society seems to believe that autistic people can't get jobs or girlfriends or good friends. Well, guess what? I happen to be living proof that's it's possible to get all of that, even for autistic people. So don't think of autistic people as weirdos.\nBy the way, you have Google, don't you? Search for \"advantages found in autism. That should teach your outdated mindset something new._ @DegreesOfThree¬† By the way, I forgot to ask...when exactly did you get diagnosed with Aspergers?_ @filipeflower¬† Why do you have a girlfriend, and not a boyfriend? Are you discriminating against homosexuals?_ @filipeflower¬† I was diagnosed in 2002 when I was getting virtually no sunlight or exercise and eating a high carb (high glyphosate) diet._ @filipeflower¬† I don't think of autistic people as weirdos. I think of them as victims of toxins in their food, water and environment. When I used the term 'unfortunate creatures,' I was referring to the pale, scrawny, socially awkward males that think they have autism, but actually are just lacking sunlight, exercise, and proper nutrition._ @DegreesOfThree¬† Are you serious? That's your best argument ? The fact that I have a girlfriend automatically means homophobia? You're an idiot, if you actually believe that.\nNobody's in charge of someone's sexual orientation, but that person him/herself. I am in favor of homossexual people's rights, but that doesn't mean I need to mimic them. See if you can learn that, you troll._ @DegreesOfThree¬† 2002, huh? Then that means your diagnosis is outdated. According to DSM V, it is now called Autism Spectrum Disorder. Ask any qualified/updated Doctor and they will agree to this._ @DegreesOfThree¬† Wait, so you claim that the cause of autism is lack of sunlight, exercise and what you consider propper nutrition? Do you have any valid sources to back that up?_ @filipeflower¬† You clearly have reading comprehension problems as well. I do not think lack of sunlight, exercise, and nutrition cause autism. I said they may be causing symptoms that RESEMBLE autism symptoms. True autism is very similar to Alzheimer's, and is probably caused by misfolding of proteins due to glyphosate poisoning, by destruction of the microbiome and replacement of the amino acid glycine, by the glyphosate molecule. Dr. Stephanie Seneff is currently writing a book on this topic. Vaccines may also play a role in triggering autoimmune reactions, which are frequently found in connection with autism patients._ @DegreesOfThree¬† Well, anyway, that's just one Doctor you mentioned. There's a whole lot of them who disagree with that and even have evidence to debunk that old fashioned comment that says \"autism is bad\". You're the one who needs education, not us. You may have a degree in biology (if you're telling the truth, that is), but that doesn't make you a true expert on the subject (as you yourself admitted already). So why do you keep trying to bring down autistic people, when you lack propper factual knowledge about it yourself? I take it you didn't use google to research anything about autism. Am I wrong on that?_ @jochemgoede5759¬† Bearly Listening is an anti-autism troll. Ignore him._ I love the sound of that :)_ If you want help with making sure it is a great representation, You can always ask meüòä\nI am a 16 year old girl with high functioning autism (Aspergers) and anxiety. Besides that, I went to a special autism-school, so I know how a lot of other people with autism experience it as well._ @indigolarsen5638¬† i would like for you to do some test reading for me. Is that ok? Just 3 chapters. I have facebook if u want to talk._ @indigolarsen5638¬† dan.indiana.5_ Agree with the second part. But I don't see how it's relevant and what you even mean exactly. could you please elaborate?_ @jochemgoede5759¬† It's a spam comment. Report it._ Depending on the scenario I dont think reprimanding is the correct step. It can also cause stress in those people and I think there are better ways to teach people this either then such brute force methods. (I will agree though there are a lot of scenarios where this is a needed step.)_ Both, but the language comes down to the individual's relationship to their disorder.  Some don't want to be defined by it, but some proudly call themselves autistic._ You're conflating \"disorder\" with \"disease.\" They're not the same. ASD is just what the term says--a disorder, and I think most of us do not \"deny\" it, as you suggested._ Are you saying autism is a disease? There's a lot of Doctors who disagree with you on that and they have scientific evidence to back that up._ I wonder if some of these unusual behaviours are more noticeable now because life is so overwhelming and frantic. I think we all can benefit from being less busy and having less things._ maybe 10% of this is helpful and explains autism over all but 90% only relates to this person and their experience.. if you dont already understand autism somewhat, this will not help you understand the spectrum._ My Son has Aspeger syndrome, i think i have too. You are not alone, believe me. üëç_ BRAVO!!! Thank you so much for sharing your world with us. Absolutely, we are ALL part of the natural human spectrum. Much love to you <3_ Very eye opening thank you for this talk_ I think the autistic perspective introduces more potential, more varied thinking, more opportunity for humanity than if we were to find a ‚Äúcure‚Äù. Society benefits from diversity, we don‚Äôt all need the same thought patterns and behavior. I think there‚Äôs too much of that as it is._ Interesting video, most of the people that I know that have autism can't communicate in this way._ I want to hang out with this dude!_ Thank you very much for your contribution, greetings from Germany! :)_ who wants to be normal any ways =)_ Thank You so much for sharing your story with us. Blessings!_ \"I can't stand loud noises\"\n\"The world should also adapt to autistic people. Thank you\"\n\nAudience: wooooooo\n                    Loud clapping_ Impressive, Ethan! Thank you for expressing what some of us on the spectrum can't. Great job! üòÄ_ As an autistic person, I feel I have to say this. While I agree with a lot of what he said, and autism is certainly NOT a disease, describing it like it's just a different way of thinking is just as bad as any other blanket statement. It IS a disability. There are a lot of autistic people who learn to work with it, and live happily, but there are others who struggle with it. There are people who would love to be able to function normally in society and while society SHOULD accept an autistic person, it's wrong to think that it is society's problem that we are like this. Autism is a spectrum, and people aren't trying to cure it because they 'think it's a disease'. They're trying to cure it because people are born with a chemical imbalance that can be so severe that many of them may never be able to communicate normally even with their own parents. They're trying to cure it because it can be so severe that it robs a person of any hope of ever maturing or becoming an actual member of society. If you don't want to be cured, that's fine. But demonizing the people who are trying to find a solution for the people who don't get a brain cooperative enough to let them at least pass as normal enough to function in the world is harmful._ amazing talk!! <3_ I'm an autistic person who did not suspect I had it until I was past 40. It's much better when autistic kids know about it, the younger the better. In the 70s, when  I went to high school, autism was unknown. I was one of the rare smarter kids who graduated from a normal public school without ever studying, and like a lot of us, I am exceptionally good at math. One time I was smoking a joint with some friends, and the autistic veil was lifted temporarily. I was able to have four different conversations at the same time with six different people. My youngest brother told me it was like I was a different person. When the high went away, the veil came crashing back down. Marijuana definitely helps with this condition._ \"Oh, and I also see nice hair\" \nI think he has nice hair too ^3^_ I'm in the spectrum and the woman I love is as well. She has a monotone voice most of the time, has trouble judging people's emotions from facial expressions and will only eat the same few things. I have issues with loud and bright but am artistic. She is a school teacher in Illinois and common core is horrible. I went to hvac school, CDL training, and took a cna course. I believe I was normal until being immunized in second grade as that's when everything changed and became bright and loud. it was tough in grade school as things like ADHD, autism, and Aspergers weren't diagnosed often in rural America. I still and will always have skin sensitivity to certain fabrics, I'm not big on eye contact with anyone outside of the inner circle._ I really hate the American use of the word.\nJust for a wierd aspect that they have._ he is so pure ü•∫_ In the end, we're all just people._ RJ D It's almost as if the term is completely meaningless and haphazardly applied to humans with various degrees of difficulty in adjusting to society._ @DegreesOfThree¬† well, uhm, no. Just, no. That's not how diagnosis works thank you very much_ Jochem Goede How can you diagnose something if we can't even agree on what the symptoms are? How are this man's symptoms any different than brain injury?_ @DegreesOfThree¬† what symptoms of brain injury? In what region of the brain? And how does that suddenly explain away all the symptoms?\nThis doesn't make any sense!_ @jochemgoede5759¬† That guy is a troll. Ignore._ @DegreesOfThree¬† Dude, all you're doing is trying to bring down anything related to autism. And apparently you like to reply to people questioning anyone who's sided with autism, as if you have any authority. Quit playing the better man card, okay, troll?_ That's funny af lmao_ When you get that they heared but not get it (fast enough).\nBut habits._ LOL, true, did not realize that. Good catch._ actually twice...ü§≠_ üòÇüòÇüòÇ_ He is masking the loud noises. He is adapting to accommodate us. When will we do the same?_ Ironic_ Yeah I noticed that too. Very surprising_ ... Was gonna say im autistic and have gone to a club with friends \nThe flashing lights where blinding me to a point i lost my freinds and the music ... I went out so many times just because it was too loud and couldnt hear anyone_ Lol_ Levi Bull mood_ omg I know I was sitting no the heater this morning and my dad just would not stop typing on his laptop\nit anoyed me soo much DX \nI had to go on the heater in the bathroom ='(\nidk why i just made this comment XD_ Autistic people who need help telling the news to others: WOOOOOOOOOOOOOO_ @BananaBug¬† Omg yes I also hate especially mouse clicking :D Thanks God Noise Cancelling Headphones exist lmao xD_ You wanted them to adapt to us INSTANLY?!\nThats not a fair expectation._ haha I was waiting for the applauds the whole talk_ what‚Äôre they gonna do just sit there_ Even if the noises aren't loud they still can be pretty overwhelming. Atleast for me they can be pretty overwhelming_ Lmfao_ @BleakComposure¬† Who's them?_ wtf lmao_ LMAO._ I caught that immediately and it really bothered me_ @AwesomeFlamingoX¬† yes_ DUDE HAHAHAHHAH_ Yeh man !_ @es279¬† yeah. It is\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it‚Äôs not as funny when you have it yourself\n\n\n\n\nI dont_ We can take that sort of stuff, we just don't really like it. If you hate someone, does that mean you're gonna lash out on them? Ofcourse not, that is called physical assault, you still want to punch that person but you prefer not to because it isn't convenient for you._ LMAO. Funny, but he meant erratic loud noises._ I didn't hear him say the world should adapt to accommodate people with ASD. As someone on the spectrum I think it's absurd to expect the world to change to fit me. You'll run into way too many problems in life if you think like that._ @tintogranreserva¬† the first time was before he said that he's sensitive to noises_ @You are correct But There are autistic people who can understand irony. You don't seem to be aware of it._ @Enoch-Root¬† The main problem is that many societies built the world mostly for neurotypical people and the so-called disabled people got excluded. That's one of the things that needs to be re-arranged._ @filipeflower¬† No it doesn't. People like me with Asperger's or ADHD or whatever need to learn how to function in society. People who go on about making the world better for people with abnormal psychology also tend to be the ones who treat people with mental abnormalities the worst, because they're the kind of person who says the right things to fit in with their social group and want to be seen saying they care, the moment someone who is abnormal comes along and says something considered unacceptable these people ostracize them. If you want to make things better then just try to be more accepting or people with different opinions, have friends with different interests and political views, get to know people, especially the ones you don't like or agree with._ @You are correct But I already read the DSM V before. Next time I see my Doctor, I'll ask him to bring it again._ @Enoch-Root¬† That's your point-of-view  speaking. But you can't prove that, can you?_ @filipeflower¬† Prove what? Proof is something we only get in mathematics and formal logic. If more people took time to get to know people it'd make things easier for those who often don't do well socially. But I think it's unrealistic to think the human behavior is going to change much, so I think the psychologically abnormal people are better off trying to learn how to get along with people and be aware of their common faux pas._ @Enoch-Root¬† I don't know what \"faux pas\" means. But that doesn't debunk what I said before. Normal is a subjective term. And just because someone is in the majority, doesn't mean they have the truth._ @filipeflower¬† Faux pas means misstep, a social faux pas meaning that someone did or said something socially awkward or inappropriate. And it's the kind of thing that people with Asperger's often do. And with the drastic and rapid ways that what's considered socially acceptable are changing at the moment it's only getting harder to know what the rules of behavior are now._ @Enoch-Root¬† I appreciate your explanation, but let me just say three things:\n1- The term \"Asperger's\" is no longer used.\n2- Autistic people aren't the only ones who do that.\n3- Where exactly are these \"social rules\" registered? Please specify._ @filipeflower¬† Fine, ASD if you prefer but many people still use the term Asperger's syndrome as it's more specific than ASD. And the fact that the social rules aren't clearly codified is part of the problem. People with Asperger's like clear logical rules, it's why so many are fascinated by computers, or science, etc. But social rules aren't clear, yet most people intuitively understand them, while people with Asperger's are more prone to struggling with fitting in or often say things that are considered inappropriate or rude, though often we're just being honest. Also the monotone thing, and talking at length about one thing and not showing interest in other people's interests._ @Enoch-Root¬† 1- That's your opinion. But the fact remains the same. That term (Asperger's Syndrome) is outdated now.\n\n2- You can't speak for every person, you know. You think everyone of that kind likes or understands whatever subject you're bringing up? What are your sources for this?\n\n3- \"Abnormal\" and \"normal\" are both subjective terms. Why do you believe that neurotypical people are the only \"normal\" ones?_ @Enoch-Root¬† \nYou're obviously right concerning we can't rearrange the world to suit us, however, we can make adaptions to places like home and work environments, luckily some countries are already doing so because they have the rule \"health and safety comes first.\" But we obviously can't redesign environments like the streets. \n\nYou're only mentioning half of the coin. Relationships are a two way street, a relationship will not work out if only one, in this case neurodivergent people, try to learn to understand the other. The society has to learn how to understand us as well for us to have a successful relationship with our societies.\n\nPeople not learning how to understand us is one of the causes of unemployment, isolation and depending on the individual's sensitivity it can go as far as suicide.\n\nThere is no such thing as \"normal people\", I can ask anyone for a description of \"normal person\", then if I ask them to describe themselves not one of them will align with their description of \"normal person\" proving \"normal person\" is delusional, especially since every human being is by fact different and that the term \"normal\" was not even in use until 1840. What did so called \"normal people\" call themselves before 1840? or was there no such invention yet?_ @shahabraziq4072¬† as an autistic woman that question torments me on my bad days. I feel like I‚Äôm breaking my bones to accommodate the eccentricities of non autistics and they freak out any time I make a mistake. It can be heartbreaking. To those who cut us slack, thank you. It‚Äôs all we need often time, just let us be us._ @icel8828¬† So how do you know its not funny then?._ @Enoch-Root¬† Totally agree with you, Noise actually effects people with ASD differently, I find going to gigs, concerts and footballs peaceful why cos there only have one noise to cope with go out for a meal that is well to noisy every tidy noise amplified then I find it hard to focus on what's happening around me._ @carljones7380¬† because I‚Äôve experienced it_ @icel8828¬† So you have ASD_ @carljones7380¬† I have Aspergers_ @icel8828¬† Your first post ending with I don't, leads me think you wasn't ASD._ @filipeflower¬† Can speak for me, I can related to what Enoch is referring to being Austic, also the term Aspergers isn't out dated either, the term Aspergers was drop cause it don't look good having a condition named after the Doctor especially when in had a helping in killing quite a few million Jews and the like._ @icel8828¬† How can you experience it that's talking in the past tense, it don't just stop._ @carljones7380¬† Did you even read the DSM V?_ @filipeflower¬† That be the 2013_ @carljones7380¬† What exactly do you mean?_ @carljones7380¬† i mean I don‚Äôt experience it anymore because I‚Äôm not around it anymore_ @icel8828¬† Get you now, I have similar experiences like that myself, when I end up making idiot friends my ASD shows out more so my   friends say._ @filipeflower¬† can't you work that out *_ @filipeflower¬† Would you like the full title of DSM V 2013 edition._ @carljones7380¬† Why does that matter?_ @filipeflower¬† why put the abbreviations of a book title, and what's reading the book got to do with what I posted to you._ @carljones7380¬† Read it and find out. Prefferably with a qualified psychologist._ @filipeflower¬† And why do you presume i a Psychologist?_ @filipeflower¬† Why it's a manual listing different neurological disorders , which I've already glance years ago, so what's your point._ @carljones7380¬† If you actually read DSM V, you would know that, instead of \"Asperger's Syndrome\", it is now called Autism Spectrum Disorder. There are multiple articles that accurately explain why the term Asperger's Syndrome is no longer used. What you stated before is just one of those reasons. I suggest you start reading the rest._ @filipeflower¬† Oh dear I don't need to read a book to know why the name changes, it was all over the msm and as I've already told you._ @carljones7380¬† So you preffer to avoid knowledge then?_ @filipeflower¬† Aspergers syndrome was added to the American Psychiatric association DSM in 1994  as a separate disorder from Autism, in 2013 the DSM-5 replaced Autsim Disorder, Aspergers syndrome and other pervasive Development disorders with the umbrella term of A S, D. so what's your point._ @carljones7380¬† Thank you for that explanation._ @carljones7380¬† \nAsperger's is an outdated term professionals don't use anymore. They were three types of autism with one been Asperger's. Not too long ago all three types of Autism were squashed together put beneath the same umbrella ASD, that's why we now have these high and low-functioning labels that didn't exist before. People who professionals would of diagnosed as people with Asperger's, now diagnose them as people with \"high-functioning autism\".\nSome people on the Autism Spectrum were feeling offended by the term Asperger's, those without Asperger's wondering why must people with Asperger's have a special name with all the others just labelled autism._ @danielmoore4024¬† and are you American?_ @carljones7380¬† \nBritish_ @danielmoore4024¬† then you should know there's more than just three groups on the Autsim spectrum._ @carljones7380¬† \nPay attention, is \"were\" present or past tense?_ @danielmoore4024¬† Oh that's a cheap trick picking on the grammar of a Autistic person very grown up._ @danielmoore4024¬† The term high functioning was first used in 1911 by a Swiss psychiatrists Eugen Bleuler. Many  professionalfelt Aspergers syndrome was simply a milder form of Autism and used the term High functioning autism to describe these individuals, since the 1940s. Also some professionals today  do not like using the high functioning autism._ @carljones7380¬† \nI'm not playing any tricks on you whatsoever, I were talking about the past and you falsely accused me of talking about the present.\nDid I give a specific date of when high and low-functioning labels were first used? No, it's just you putting words in my mouth. Professionals do still use these labels otherwise I wouldn't find parents claiming their children are diagnosed with \"high-functioning autism\".\nTypical you start acting like a victim._ @danielmoore4024¬† I mentioned the past because high functioning autism isn't a new term and it's also a term some professionals don't like using today, like my professional contact at Hampshire Autsim does not like the term High functioning autism._ @danielmoore4024¬† I apologise to me seemed you was pointing out grammar. This a a defensive way of dealing with people, being Austic people quickly pick up on my spelling and grammar and use it against me when they have nothing to say. One of two things happens first they go away or like yourself they point out that wasn't their intention and we carry on with the conversation. It's a first being called a victim tho üòÇüòÇüòÇ_ @danielmoore4024¬† You wrote \"That's why we now have these high and low functioning labels that didn't exist before\" this is talking bout the present not the past._ @carljones7380¬† \nAnd don't we have these labels now?\nIf not, why are hundreds of people of online autism communities telling me they're diagnosed with \"high-functioning autism\"?\n\nOn one of the communities, The National Autistic Society, I began a discussion on these functioning labels and all those diagnosed in the 21st century tell me on medical records written by doctors \"high-functioning autism\", not Asperger's.\n\nAre you going to tell me all these doctors, autistic people and parents of autistic children are liars?_ @danielmoore4024¬† I never said people weren't being diagnosed with high functioning autism, I said it's not a new term and some professionals don't like and don't use the term the high functioning autism and people with Aspergers still use the term rather than high functioning autism._ @danielmoore4024¬† please show me where I have called Doctors, parents and other ASD people lyers. I merely point out to you that high functioning autism is not a new term used to describe Aspergers. And that some professionals don't like the term High functioning autism either and some people with Aspergers still want to use Aspergers instead of high functioning autism._ @carljones7380¬† \nThen why did you start arguing against me? Just because some professionals don't like using them doesn't mean they don't use them, my specialist nurse of the NHS agrees with me that I'm an \"Autistic Person\" and not a \"Person With Autism\", it's just professionals have to use professional terminology whether they like it or not. \n\nThe National Autistic Society I mentioned, on their site they teach autism is part of the individual's identity and support the neurodiversity paradigm._ @danielmoore4024¬† because you claimed that high functioning autism is a new term, when it's not a new term. I also point out that my professional from Hampshire Autsim doesn't like the term High functioning autism._ @carljones7380¬† \nI said it became made right back at the time everything was placed under one umbrella, O didn't write the advective \"new\" anywhere, I didn't give specific dates or years, just when it was all put under the same umbrella._ @danielmoore4024¬† it was put under the same unbrella in 2013, yes you never said new you said Aspergers was outdated and ASD was the term used today. All I was saying s that high functioning autism is not a new term._ I consider myself as a normal person, I also can‚Äôt stand loud noises. Get a grip !_ @kirbygulbrandsen4507¬† \nDefine the \"normal person\".\nHow does the normal person think?\nWhat colour is the normal person's skin?\nWhich country does the normal person live in? \nHow does the normal person behave?\nHow does the normal person's brain function?\n\nHere's the shameful truth;\n\nNormal People = Division among the human race.\n\nDivision = Discrimination, Cultural Prejudice, Oppression, Racism and Conflict.\n\nSo called \"normal people\" are the creators of these offences and find these offences sustainable._ @danielmoore4024¬† did you think of that all by yourself._ @kirbygulbrandsen4507¬† \nI'm sure I'm not the only person who's noticed that division is the cause of discrimination, cultural prejudice, oppression, racism and conflict. \n\nThere's no such thing as a \"normal person,\" it's an undeniable fact that every human being is different. I could ask anyone to describe normal people, if I then ask them to describe themselves not one of them will fit their definition of \"normal people\". \n\nNormal is a social construction, it is artificial designed by the thoughts of men and women. \"Normal People\" is a flawed invention._ @danielmoore4024¬† you are now picking on me because I don‚Äôt think the way you think I should. I think you‚Äôre judging me and others based on the way you think. Remember we aren‚Äôt all the same, including color, nationality, gender, or  education. Please don‚Äôt judge me based on your beliefs._ @kirbygulbrandsen4507¬† Find the Autsim simular on YouTube may give you a idea of what it's like for some autistic people._ They didn't think that through._ @danielmoore4024¬† Division is caused by putting people in little boxes, and favouring one box over another box which puts the boxes against each other, causing the boxes to see discrimination, prejudice, oppression and racism towards their box creating conflict._ @carljones7380¬† \nAnd that's what so called normal people do, I'm going to show you what two autistic people shared with me today on an autism community.\nI quote;\n\n1) \"My supervisor threatened to write me up and fire me today bc my crew leader complained about me having an \"attitude\". I've had this problem on almost every job I've ever had.\"\n\n2) \"My boss has started treating me badly. He made me meet with him Friday and he was ranting about my \"horrible\" communication. I told him that most people on the spectrum struggle with communication in some way. His answer was \"that doesn't matter. This is business, deal with it.\"\n\nOn autism communities we have autistic adults been discriminated by so called normal people because delusional normal people are too arrogant to acknowledge they don't understand, and are plain prideful discriminating minorities._ @danielmoore4024¬† Again I'm Autistic so why you showing me, it's as if you I think I don't no what's like living an Austic life._ @carljones7380¬† \nWhy are you arguing with me if you agree with me?_ @danielmoore4024¬† My Advice read the 2010 Autistic Act and get a Solicitor. That's what I would do._ @danielmoore4024¬† Also check the disability act something in there about how employers have to take the persons disability into account and make adequate changes to improve work life._ @danielmoore4024¬† Who said I agree with you, I'm just showing you  something so you can go help someone._ if you don't like loud sounds..then you should stay at home..the whole world can not adapt to just one person..it's time autistic people accept that for once...i feel uncomfortable around large dogs because of personal reasons, should everyone leave their large dogs at home because they make ME uncomfortable? don't you know how rediculous that sounds?_ üò≠üò≠_ @valeriapebble¬† what bothered you ?_ Years ago I was in a mall with a friend that has a serious case of unmedicated ADHD. He drags me into a Dave & Busters, a kind of mini-arcade with flashing lights, subwoofers, vibrating machines, screaming kids.... He just zigzags through, laughing at the screens. I rush out after I realize he's going in circles.\nHe runs out after me, yelling at me as I'm panting and digging out an anti-anxiety pill.\n\"What tf is wrong with you?!\" he shouts. \n\"None of your business,\" I said, knowing he truly wouldn't understand. I've tried explaining sensory overload to him again and again, but it's like talking to a brick wall.\nMy adaptive strategy?\nI don't hang out with him any more.\nHe asks every now and then, and I deflect (as masking ability, learning to lie-without-lying), I say \"later, later\". \nIt's been three years. He stopped taking his stimulant pills half a decade ago.\nIf there was a pill for autistic sensory overload, YES I would take it. But he is irresponsible on his end, and I just have my Clonopin._ MURICA_ This comment section makes me want to donate to autism speaks, generously_ Dr Yuching Lee¬† Yeah. Um. It doesn't work like that. You might as well be growing an arm for someone born without one, or giving sight to the blind._ @carljones7380¬† I love how you and Danny picked the ball up while both of you , started with me. Then broke off into your own little argument about Autism, I , ( the normal one) then just sat back and watched the both of you try to explain how the other should think. Just think, this is a perfect world after all. Stop with the bad attitudes._ @kirbygulbrandsen4507¬† \nIgnore reality and history then, you still haven't even defined a \"normal person.\"\nEnjoy being a supporter of \"Black Lives Don't Matter\" supporting the police murdering innocent people, makes you just like a murderer letting others do your dirty work for you. Makes you someone who supports employment and disability discrimination, you're disgraceful. It was so called normal people discriminating the black people and the two autistic people I quoted.\n\nSo I suppose a couple of characteristics of the \"normal person\" (you) are discrimination and racism showing I were right, normal people discriminate and are racist, that makes me so glad not to be \"normal\" like you._ @NagumoHaruya¬† \nOpen your eyes, autistic people are doing exactly what you're suggesting, but unfortunately neurotypical people won't allow them. Autistic people don't want to go to shopping centres and want delivery to avoid the lights and sounds, guess what? Nonautistic people won't allow them, nonautistic people force them to go to the shop. \n\nNo matter how much we try to avoid painful situations, you won't allow us, you force us to do everything your way.\n\nHow have you felt during lockdown unable to meet up and socialize with your friends in person?\nI can safely assume you didn't like it. It's even more painful for autistic people as you force us to do things your way with your ableism._ @NagumoHaruya¬† Actually, there are alternatives for that. You simply need to inform yourself properly about it._ @emojisarepurecancer8097¬† That's not a very good refference._ Hehe. Irony at its pinnacle!_ Evolution._ @Alex Korova Your point?_ Have you realised how stupid your comment was yet? Even if it was meant to be a joke.\nI have Autism and I'm in 2 bands. I play in front of hundreds of people regularly. I can handle the crowd noise because I mask. It's not that hard to understand is it?_ I didn‚Äôt realise what you meant then (as in I didn‚Äôt catch on that it was a bad thing)_ ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫_ My thoughts exactly!! Seemed to me that the audience wasn‚Äôt really hearing what he was saying._ ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è_ That's not what he said_ @Hggfcgghg¬† And why not?_ @Hggfcgghg¬† You mis-understood. Just because autistic people (and other people) are in a minority, doesn't mean they should be excluded. Plus, nobody has the truth on their side just because they're in a majority.\nAnd by the way, Autism has already been proven scientifically to be real. You simply didn't research anything about that._ @Hggfcgghg¬† There are scientific studies that prove Autism is real. You have search engines for that.\n\nAs for the \"majority rules\" argument, that's like saying we should be subjected to the Russians since they're in the majority and we're not. Also, that doesn't debunk what I said. Nobody has the truth on their side just because they're in the majority._ @Hggfcgghg¬† Perhaps because those were different times. Technology has advanced a lot since then and there's a lot more awareness today than a century ago._ @Hggfcgghg¬† Whoever you are, do your research about Autism before making comments like those. Clearly, you need more knowledge on this subject._ @Hggfcgghg¬† As I explainned earlier, you have search engines to find that information by yourself. Google should be a good start. Also, I never claimmed to be an expert, but at least, I'm better informed about this than you are. It's your job to find trustworthy sources that accurately explain what Autism really is. I don't have any obligation to do your job for you. Besides, I have my test to worry about next day. Good luck.üçÄ_ @Hggfcgghg¬† I don't believe in God._ sorry..._ @Hggfcgghg¬† ...what?_ This is funny, but brief clapping an cheering for me wouldn‚Äôt trigger anything but a joyous burst in myself and I also believe it‚Äôs that way for most. Im not trying to speak for all my friends with the tism, just how I understand it from my own experience._ LOL rip_ HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA_ Unexpected, random loud noises that last an unknown but long time such as at a crowded party or public place from multiple conversations going at once that are unrelated to what you are doing and make it hard to think and concentrate and an expected 10 second applause at the end of a speech that you made are different things. Of course, I'm not autistic myself, or at least not diagnosed, so take my observation with a grain of salt._ That's true. I've always known I'm different, but I'm able to function independently, work, and pay my own bills. I deliver medications, though, and I've seen other people with autism and other disorders who are so messed up that they were unable to really grow up, even if they were elderly. So if someone can find a cure for autism, I won't take it, but more power to them._ Scumfuck McDoucheface¬† Your comment and the specific thought \"I am glad that Scumfuck McDoucheface agrees with me\" gave me a much needed smile. XD_ Is there anyway to save a youtube comment? Because I might need to refer to this at a later date._ @couchpotatoe91¬† Well thank you! The only thing I can think of would be to bookmark the video, or maybe Gyazo it!_ So true, exactly what I was thinking! I work with children with autism, but their autism isn't high functioning like the one Ethan has, who can (if I say so) go on with his life quite normally, with the exception of a little social akwardness. The children I work with can't communicate, let alone speak, they have severe repetitive actions that are destructive and some even self -harm as a way of calming themselves down. So, autism definitely isn't a disease, it is a disorder (per DSM V) and as such should be treated, at least with the ones who need it to survive and have at least a chance for independance._ I agree with that, I was put off when he made it seem bad that people were trying to find a cure._ The autism spectrum is quite wide. Everybody in the spectrum is different. I have asperger and I notice there are positive and negative features to autism. For example: Hyperfocus can be really useful in producing or learning, but it can also make you blind. Like tunnelvision. \nOr high sensitivity can make you see details or mistakes others won't notice as quickly, but being in a room full of people and I get flooded.\nI don't really see it as a disability for all the abilities I get from Asperger. Maybe in current society I don't fit in very well, but I'm great being in selected company. But as I stated I am just one unique example. The are lots of heavy autistic people who don't have the positive features. I think you can call that a disability, cause you get nothing good in return._ @maartenhimself¬†, your last sentence sums it up greatly!_ @kristinamilolaza6760¬†, yes, exactly!_ Weaver, I've never heard anyone explain this as succinctly and eloquently as you.  Thank you._ @kristinamilolaza6760¬† Way back in highschool, part of my extracurricular time was helping with the more severe special ed class. And specifically I had an hour helping my counselor, herself an autism specialist, teach and care for two severely autistic students. It was honestly kind of a surreal experience, helping with these two, and seeing what very easily could have been me if I had gotten it worse. No amount of self pride or societal acceptance is going to help them, they didn't even get the chance to understand these concept.  They're going to spend their entire lives having to be lead by the hand, and it's a mercy that they don't understand their situation enough to feel bad about it. Something about autism that I don't see brought up much is that autistic people are, more often than not, sort of trapped in their own head, and I can't imagine anybody likes being trapped anywhere._ @auberjean6873¬† Thank you for the compliment! I don't generally get bothered by much, but I felt what he said was harmful.  It's not just some opinion on a youtube video, it's a ted talk, which means it's going to have a huge audience, and with the speaker himself being autistic, I feel a lot of that audience is going to take his word as gospel.  Autism may not be deadly, but it can still rob someone of a 'real' life, and that research may just be able to give that back to people some day._ I was worried if the made himself too \"normal\" and it get characterized as just another part of being \"normal\" then children with this will not be able to get extra help in school to learn how to better fit in with society.  I don't want to \"cure\" it.   I just think it is good for kids with autism to learn coping skills, what they do is different and maybe try to do that stuff at home etc.. In the end kids with autism will grow up and need to be able to hold some type of job to be independent in life and I worry they won't get the help they need as a kid if autism get characterized as normal._ @dorothysnyder7014¬† A cure may be a bit of a grandiose goal to be talking about really, but I think if it's possible, there really is no downside to one.  But it is important to make sure a developing, autistic child has the right kind of help. We can't act like a cure is on the way any more than we can act like one isn't warranted at all. I struggled with life because my mom and counselor [With the best intentions and care for me, of course] took the 'normalizing' route with my support. They made sure my support network tended to my unique needs.  Which was all fine and good that it made learning easier and they did everything they could to smooth out the speed bumps of my middle and high school years.  The problem was when it was time to enter the real world, it wasn't nearly as willing to bend around me. I couldn't just stroll into the real world like I was normal because I wasn't no matter how much I was treated like nothing was wrong with me, like all I really needed was a special kind of teaching. I wasn't prepared at all, and it was a hard and miserable struggle finding a balance between what society would accept from me, and what I could sustain mentally.  It's easy to forget with autistic children that it's still just as important to prepare them for the real world as it is to make sure their autistic needs are considered.  Sorry for being so long winded, this is of course a bit of a personal subject for me!_ I feel it Can be a disability when it causes one to suffer and not be able to function. AS a spectrum \" disorder\", not all are as high functioning as seen here. Some are non-verbal, can make NO eye contact, and suffer greatly in many areas of their lives. This is why we DX it and call it a disability and have speech therapist, OT PT and other specialist help. I have to say I do think if the world help by creating a more austisic friendly world, they wouldn't struggle as much. Same as elf-handed people. They dont have a disability, but many struggle with right-handed notebooks and supplies causing issues. For that though we have created left-handed or neutral object to work for THEIR needs. But we dont ever call left-handed people disabled._ I am also autistic (high functioning.) You put up an interesting point, and I like your message. Part of what makes me nervous about a 'cure' is that it might cause a line to be drawn on the spectrum determining whether or not someone is deemed compatible with society. When I was younger it presented itself much more then it does now. Coming from a small anti-vax town I know first hand the stigma and fear from adults who believe that autism can be caused. Those same people would treat their children on the spectrum. If I was raised in one of those households with an existing cure, I would be a completely different person. (also wouldn't it be hilarious and ironic if the Autism cure was a vaccine. I know it has nothing to do with antibodies but still)_ Yep depends on the spectrum though, i have mild Asperger‚Äôs syndrome and I genuinely feel like it has many benefits but also consequences and weaknesses in other areas. I do feel like in severe cases a cure is a good idea but only if absolutely necessary and the person is miserable._ Thank you for saying this so succinctly. I wish more people understood this, there's a reason it's called a SPECTRUM._ Fuckable PanCakes Your name is amazing, and I needed an extra smile today :)_ @39nubby¬† That would be hilarious, yes! And that line is a fair thing to worry about, but I would argue that even if something like that would come to pass, it would be a lesser problem than what we have now. It would still be an improvement.  Simply put, my thoughts on the matter are that it's always better to have more options, and the problems that might come about from it aren't so much caused by the options are they are caused by societal issues. [ I know above I say it's not society's problem that we are autistic but if society tries to interfere with our choice in the matter and our autonomy, that very much IS society's problem. ]_ Exactly. Ethan is giving his perspective as a high functioning person, it's very valuable and a way to fight mean stereotypes. However, autism really is a spectrum and not everyone is high functioning. Those people are even less represented, they do have special needs and probably won't be giving a ted talk. No one should be ashamed and no one should be forced to be cured, but it's not harmful to invest into research. The two aspects aren't mutually exclusive_ I really loved this comment and feel the same way. I mean OCD is a different way of thinking about things but it's constant stress and anxiety for the person who has it internally, let alone having it be severe enough to inhibit their life socially. If there are treatments as an option that can make that persons life better then I can only see that as a positive_ I as am autistic person have to agree with you. I, personally, am not affected by autism that strongly, however, the way I think and act is still different, so that people notice relatively quickly that I'm not ''normal'', this personally troubles me, because in hindsight I often know, what I did, that was weird, but I can, despite my best efforts, not avoid being different all the time, which leads to me not being socialy accepted, or rather being treated differently. This includes not really being considered being a friend by many people, but rather them trying to interact as little with me as possible. Also when people do interact with me, they do it in a way that they think I might understang. Even though I know they are just trying to help, they at the same time remind me of the fact that I am indeed not ''normal''. I would love to not be autistic as it would make life, at least for me (and probably other peoples lifes around me) easier._ @Chris01114¬† I feel you on that. It's not only a good idea for people who have it severely, but for everyone, even super high functioning people. Just knowing you're different, FEELING you're different, all the time, even if it doesn't directly effect your life that much, can easily be enough to want a treatment of some kind.  There's this cultural idea that normal is boring, or somehow lesser, but some of us might just prefer boring. I for one would love to be able to just sit down, and close my eyes, and relax.  I see people do this, in real life, in movies, just taking a moment to chill out, and I can't imagine how that works because the moment the area around me becomes quiet, my brain starts filling in all the missing sensory information with incessant thoughts._ @weaver7811¬† I completely agree that it is sort of a blessing that they don't understand the severity of their state...because they will quite likely spend their life at the mercy of their families who will constantly have to take care of them... A lot of people tend to \"romanticize\" autism ( and they often do this to children with Down Syndrome,) as people that are highly intelligent and just a little akward, and that is true for some cases but to just bluntly state that it isn't a big deal, isn't really helping anyone... That's why, while I highly respect Ethan for his courage and his acomplishments, I don't support this kind of ted talk. #MyOpinion_ You should be the one giving this TED talk! Very insightful comment! Just what I was thinking_ When my son was diagnosed at age three, one of the social workers told me that when you know a person with autism, you know THAT person. It is a spectrum disorder and not a one size fits all. The appropriate title of this should be \"What's it really like FOR ME to have autism\" because he truly can only speak for himself and his experiences no matter how similar he may be to others on the spectrum._ exactly\nas someone with aspergers, my problems have impacted my ability to be a functioning member of society to a pretty extreme extent\ni had to be pulled in 5th grade because i just couldn't handle the environment\ndespite now being 17, i can't find a job, which means i can't go to school, because our family (having three autistics) is very financially lacking (below the poverty line)\ni don't have a single friend offline, and i'm slowly losing those online\nit just,, really sucks\ni get that there are aspects of my personality that would be different if i didn't have autism, and i appreciate them, but at the same time, is it worth it?\nis it worth the extreme sensory issues, the extreme generalized anxiety and depression?\nsigh, if i could be cured, i would definitely prefer it ;;_ There are neurotypical people who are severely disabled and who cannot \"function normally\".\n\nLooking at autistic people who can't \"function normally\" and thinking that that is because they are autistic isn't really correct. There is a range of ability levels amongst the neurotypical population. Not all of them are \"High Functioning\" either, but we don't blame their neurotype. We don't describe them as \"severely neurotypical\" (Well I do sometimes, but I'm Autistic lol üòâ) We understand that they have other disabilities that are causing their difficulties. \n\nUnfortunately, the history of autism is that, for decades, only autistic people with severe (other/co-morbid) disabilities were identified as autistic as even the professionals did not understand it. Autistics who were able to \"pass\" as neurotypical went under the radar. They were not included in the narrative. Their voices were effectively as silenced as those Autistic people who could not speak. Consequently, all the research and understanding is based on those individuals who were identified and on the views and opinions of people who were not themselves autistic. Much of it misses the mark in truly understanding what autism is as it leaves out half of the Autistic population and centres the allistic viewpoint. This is how the world has come to understand autism as a terrible affliction that causes varying degrees of disability and not what it actually is; a different type of brain that occurs naturally within the diversity of the human species. \n\n\"Normally\" is a value judgement based on what most people are like. It is not an absolute. Who decides what is \"normal\"? Why the privileged majority that's who. In this case neurotypical people.\n\nI am really sad to see other autistic people thinking this way and expressing this view. I would respectfully ask you to consider that some of what you believe about autism may be what living in an NT-dominated society has left you thinking and believing about yourself.\n\nI would heartily recommend Neurotribes by Steve Silberman (Papa Steve!!! üëê *Autistic flappy exuberance*) to anyone wishing to learn more about autism and its history and to autistic people who want to better understand themselves and their history.\n\nMuch love to you my Autistic friends, and to the neurotypical/allistic allies: thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è_ @MagickCat1¬† I was not talking about NT people with disabilities. \n\nI have both experienced personally and seen people having trouble handling life because of autism. Not other disabilities, autism. The rigid mindedness that comes with it. The social issues. Things that are undeniably and directly connected to autism. That there are other people who experience these difficulties for other reasons does not prove that it is not also caused by autism. \n\nAutism may occur naturally, but that does not mean it is a good thing, and it is, by definition, abnormal.  The social stigma is that abnormal is inherently bad and therefor being abnormal on it's own causes people to feel bad, and no debate on what it means to be normal is going to keep those people from feeling different. I'll leave it to someone else to try and change the world so that this is not the case but right now, that's how it is, and I would rather have the research that leads to some of these people having a choice in the matter than not. \n\nI'm not saying autistic people should feel bad for ourselves, or that we should be self pitying. We shouldn't feel bad about being autistic or get it in our heads that we are lesser for it.  But our cogs provably do not always comfortably fit the machine we were born into. My views on the matter come from experiencing this first hand, seeing it with others, a LOT of self reflection, and generally studying the matter for various reasons over the years. What the world abroad things really doesn't mean much to me, the world seems to think a lot of things that are provably wrong to me. I think this. Me. I have come to these conclusions on my own. \n\nAlso, Steve Silberman advocates for the accommodating of autism as a disability, and likens it to people in wheelchairs._ @weaver7811¬† you friend, just keep putting my thoughts into words\nme and you would make great debate partners haha_ i think what he is trying to say is that he does not want to see young kids who have autism just drugged up so society thinks they are normal, although yes i am not fond of demonizing them and a \"drug\" that helps them function better would benefit society in the long run, i just don't want to see another adderal epidemic_ In your opinion, do you think Autism Spectrum Disorder should be studied and treated as a personality disorder, like OCPD or NPD? It is comorbid with a few of them already, and is already measurable under similar psychological parameters; I think it's unfairly separated from them as something totally different, when it should be somewhere like Cluster C alongside OCPD and Avoidant PD._ @couchpotatoe91¬† screenshot it._ Absolutely. 100% that was the part that didn't sit right with me._ Your take reminds me of the mutant dilemma in XMen. Some people believed that mutantism was a curse and they wanted to be rid of it or rid others of it, and others believed it was a blessing and an innate part of who they were._ @MagickCat1¬† Brilliant comment I see exactly what you're saying and I agree hole heartedly. If the world was geared more for neuro diversity maybe the more typical neurology people would struggles as we do. Then we could search for a cure for them to help them be more diverse. Would that be a wonderful world to live in üíú_ Weaver  As an autistic person, I think the danger lies in a ‚Äúcure‚Äù being administered to people who don‚Äôt want one or don‚Äôt have the freedom of making that decision. Some parents would give their children this ‚Äúcure‚Äù without thinking twice and could potentially rob the world of a person who is special and makes wonderful contributions in large part because they are autistic. So many scientists, inventors, authors, artists, etc. owe much of their success to the fact that their brain works differently. This issue reminds me of the situation in the 3rd X-Men movie where a cure is invented for mutants. Some want the cure so their lives can be easier. Some hate the cure because they are proud of who they are, but a major issue is that they might not get the choice to decide for themselves. Who has the right to take part of who you are away without your consent? Unfortunately, it seems likely a ‚Äúcure‚Äù for autism would be administered to children who haven‚Äôt had the chance to gain perspective and decide for themselves how they want to live and who they want to be. If I was offered a ‚Äúcure‚Äù I wouldn‚Äôt want one. Being autistic is who I am the same way being left handed or of American Indian heritage is part of me. We‚Äôve seen in the past when people tried to ‚Äúcure‚Äù left-handedness by forcing a child to write right handed, often using physical abuse to enforce it. The result was often stuttering, among other issues. We‚Äôve also seen throughout history when one group thought another race was inferior and needed to be eradicated, ‚Äúcuring‚Äù the human race of them. It‚Äôs a slippery slope to go down if you start looking for a ‚Äúcure.‚Äù Some people might want it, but how many will have their basic human rights infringed upon in the process?_ It's a spectrum, and the people on the fairly able end of it can't speak for the people who are severely disabled._ @AlastorTheNPDemon¬† I'm sorry for being late to respond here, were you asking this of me? If so my answer would be that, perhaps, yes. It really depends on the case and ultimately treatment is up to the one who would receive it.  I'm wary of talking too much on this particular subject though because I'm nowhere near familiar enough with either OCPD or NPD to feel like I can offer any kind of honestly considered opinion._ @yume5441¬† Aww, thank you!_ @timcummings658¬† I don't think anyone wants to see another gradeschool generation of pill zombies.  Before I got to high school they were trying that with me and I was technically doing a little better in some classes but I had also stopped drawing or doing much of anything creative, and two of my fantastic teachers I was later told pretty much said they preferred me to be distracted and at least somewhat happy than just kind of quiet and 'there'. I don't think that's what his message was but if that's what you personally take from the video, well, I can't really argue it!_ @thecatilineconspiracy That doesn't sound so much like a problem with finding a cure so much as it is being cured against your will, which is something even I would stand against. Despite a lot of rough times in my life I really drew lucky in the brain chemistry lotto and I don't think I would want to be cured if one were available, but I do think it's wrong to deny other people the option of it just because I'm happy with what I became because of it._ @averydavis1012¬† I agree that that is a danger, but that's not a problem with the idea of a cure itself, that's a problem with the system.  Some people probably would start to try doing that, and that would become a whole issue to consider and talk about, but at the same time, you can't say autism itself denies the world of people who might otherwise change history, if only they didn't have it.  The argument works both ways, more severe autism completely destroys a persons ability to become a functioning adult and even high functioning autism can cause problems severe enough that it really keeps them from being able to blossom, as it were. So what we have here are two situations where a person could be prevented from becoming somebody truly great, and the biggest difference that I see between them is that one is optional, and one is not. People forcing a treatment onto kids is very much a thing that could happen, but COULD is the major word there, and if it does happen? It can be stopped. I would rather have that situation, than no choice at all in the matter for anyone involved._ @aguythattalksnonsense4635¬† Ah man... I still get happy dreams about school. I really miss that level of structure.  Five days a week, knowing exactly where I was supposed to be and what I was supposed to be doing every hour of every day, and then go home with just enough time after and on the weekends to unwind otherwise. But, yes, some people get lucky with their chemistry, other people get super unlucky, I think most of us hover somewhere in the middle and nearly every story I've heard from autistic people talking about their life is different. Familiar struggles, sure, but different situations.  When it comes to a cure, I'd be on the fence. Right now in my life I could pretty definitively say no thank you, but there have been plenty of times through the years where I would have absolutely leapt at it.  And you know, taking it may well have destroyed the path of my life that lead me to the happy person I am now, but who's to say the person I would have become wouldn't also be happy? In the end, it's the choice I want._ I respectfully disagree with you. Autism is exactly a different way of processing things, thinking, and communicating. He is advocating for changing society to be inclusive of alternative ways of communicating which is much better than to try to force autistic people to conform to current society. Autism is only a \"disability\" because society is not made with autistic people in mind. The vast majority of Autistic people are not going to thrive by conforming to neurotypical standards. It is stressful, anxiety inducing, depressing, exhausting. Forcing autistic people into neurotypical molds is asking them to be miserable because they aren't worth being flexible for. Society is responsible for all of it's members and just as we should all learn who to communicate with Deaf folk who have an entirely unique community we also have the onus to creates spaces with autistic folks in mind as they also experience our world just in a different way.  There is no such thing as curing autism because it isn't a defect or a disease. \"Curing\" autism would be eugenics._ I completely agree. I am autistic and it really holds me back from doing many of the things I want to do in life. I don't feel like that's just because I think differently, It also effects me physically._ TBF although he didn't specify I think he was only  talking about the higher end of autism which I'm sure you know is aspergers._ @KattReen¬† \nThose of us on what you call the high-functioning end of the spectrum are the only people who can speak on behalf of what you call the low-functioning.\n\nHave you ever heard of ABA, Applied Behaviour Analysis?\nSo called low-functioning people have died because nonautistic people pressed neurotypical standards on the low-functioning, they couldn't explain how much pain ABA puts them through. Autistic people have thrown themselves out in front of cars to avoid ABA appointments. Nonautistic people speaking on behalf of them lead to them committing suicide.\n\nIf it were not for those of us you call high-functioning protesting against ABA sharing what we were put through, you neurotypicals would not of altered and would still be making children commit suicide. We've saved the lives of millions by protesting against ABA speaking on behalf of that population, what you make them feel like when you press neurotypical standards on them.\n\nAutistic adults are now seen by professionals as the best at understanding autism that they began listening to us. We've proven that those you're calling low-functioning can do the things you claim they can't and that the reason they can't do them is because neurotypical people sabotage them and define them by what they can't do as if they have no abilities whatsoever. \n\nWhen you speak for them they attempt suicide, when we speak on behalf of them they become relieved.\nSo who are you to claim we don't know what we're talking about when we're speaking on behalf of others?_ @yume5441¬† i felt this, but minus the sensory issues as mine are quite mild. (just a disclaimer, i'm not diagnosed yet however my tharapist believes i most likely have aspergers). i'd love to pretend that one day ill be normal and that one day ill be able to handle this and that ill be a normal person with a license and a degree and a job and god, friends, but that's so out of reach. just like you, i dont have a single friend in the real world and my online friends are drifitng away from me and i cant do a thing to stop it. geniunely feels like no one will ever want to be around me because of how i a. i honestly dont know if i can be happy if i keep living like this. but theres nothing i can do. this is just who i am. im just supposed to shut up and get a job or a degree and then a job and deal with my lonliness, depression, and anxiety. but it just seems like no way to live. but it's how im going to live._ Delta8!_ I have a child with autism was speech ever an issue for you growing up?

Maybe that's why?_ idk man, i used a lot of marijuana and i think i got worse._ 38, just found out im on the spectrum.  I have had the same experience with weed, 100%.  I never smoked until I was 30, and the experience for me has been remarkably different from my peers.  I have used low doses regularly for the last 2 years, and wondered whether others with autism had had similar experiences._ @kkellz1644¬† mocking like copying accents and mannerisms?_ Went to high school in the 80's. Followed a similar path, was diagnosed in 2003.\nYeas, cannabis has helped me, but it's legal status over the years has not.  Most of the difficulties in life were more related to the illegal status of weed. Since it frequently wasn't available, I'd resort to alcohol to be social, and then things go poorly. Thankfully, due to the change in legal status in my state, I can now access cannabis much more easily and I don't even think about drinking alcohol now._ As far as getting diagnosed as an adult goes. That's problematic. There just is not as much help out there for adults with autism. All the services are geared to younger people and kids. I really don't think 'the science' knows much about dealing with autism in adults, and how it changes as we get older.\nAnd since there isn't as much of a 'warm fuzzy' factor in helping adults, there is less money in it. It's just better marketing to say \"we help kids\".\nBy 30, we are forgotten._ Same with me. I would have multiple conversations on different technical subjects concurrently and never dropped a beat. It made things difficult for me when a pretty girl I didn't know would speak to me as this was going on and I wouldn't catch the non verbal cues that signaled that I wasn't paying enough attention to her._ Marijuana helps with many things ‚ù§. I can't imagine my life without it. It helps so much with my PTSD._ @kkellz1644¬† \nAsk your child if he-or she is 'mocking,' if your child says he-or she is not mocking he-or she most likely has no intention of mocking.\n\nAutistic people and nonautistic people communicate in two different ways, multiple autistic people including myself describe it as if we speak a different version of the same language, we can say the same thing as each other and it will mean one thing to a nonautistic person, but something else to autistic people.\n\nHave a read about \"the double empathy problem.\"_ I had the same thing happen with marijuana.

My brain tries to physically line everything up, constantly, but I can't actually move things with my mind, so I get anxious that everything will forever be wrong and out of place, and this repeats until I melt down.

I believe he was being facetious. \"Some are more equal than others\" means that although on paper we are equal, there will always be a rigid hierarchy of other people who have the power to keep us down. That's just human nature. It's kind of like \"separate but equal\" during segregation, which meant whites were effectively \"more equal\" than blacks, because they got more rights.

IF no diagnosis can be made, maybe vitamin deficiency could be looked into. but please don't put autistic children in bright sunlight and expect them to get better._ Jochem Goede I had many of the same traits and was convinced that I too fell somewhere on the spectrum. In actuality, I was just brainwashed into thinking that sunlight was optional for humans. Exercise, protein, vitamins, quality sleep, avoiding sugar,  carbohydrates, aluminum and heavy metals are also essential for establishing a baseline level of health before any diagnosis should be made. It's obvious that this young man gets no sunlight or exercise, and he probably doesn't sleep well or eat enough protein either._ @DegreesOfThree¬† also, saying that autism symptoms look like brain injury is just plain insulting and wrong.

Your assumptions are quite offensive üòÇ_ Bearly Listening Oh so let me guess, if a person with Down Syndrome eats Tomatoes everyday and gets lots of Vitamin C they will magically transition into a High Functioning Neurotypical ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù Human Being? I get it, you think you‚Äôve found a cure, but no such thing exists for Autism, because it‚Äôs a neurological difference, a sacrifice of brain cells for social development to be used for academic learning, an Asperger‚Äôs Brain for example, is far more effective at learning about Science, Maths, and Physics just to name a few. Asperger‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt need a cure, and standing around in the sun or going sun bathing is a rather unhelpful suggestion to Society being structured for neurotypicals and largely forgetting about and/or ignoring Neurodivergent individuals. Unfortunately this isn‚Äôt Harry Potter or a Disney Movie Ending, disabilities and unique challenges don‚Äôt simply disappear when you eat a good diet and get your daily Vitamin D and this isn‚Äôt the 17th century anymore so that logic just doesn‚Äôt cut it anymore. Also just be a little bit careful about telling people they look like they have a brain injury, you might get yourself in a bit of trouble for saying things like that to certain merciless people._ Bearly Listening It might be wise to rewatch this video and others based on Autism so that you can learn a bit more about it, and so that you‚Äôre doing a little more than nearly listening._ @jochemgoede5759¬† That guy is an anti-autism troll.

This!_ @urgandma¬† He's talking about patterned hits and misses that has to do with being different, being generally out of step, being seen as being out of step or sync, seeing with a different brain map. It's not the same as people being different. We've been raised around people being different (having various strengths) from each other, we understand those differences, and we're different then again. Yes, while people on a team might pick up on things that other people on a team miss, I worked on teams my whole life and yet, I was valued in particular for noticing the holes in things, the gaps, what would go wrong when things played out into the future. I had to hire a mathematician once to do the math to show an employer that the course of action he was planning was going to become more costly over time contrary to what seemed like economies of scale to him.  I didn't have do the math. I knew it to be so, but I had to prove it to him. (I could have done the math had I kept up with maths, but I had other interests and knew that my brain had the ability to ballpark future outcomes like this.) Over time he came to understand that my brain simply sorted things and that it was worth taking what I had to say seriously. I catch more of what most other people miss._ @IExpectedBSJustNotThisMuchBS¬† yes, and I'm not particularly impressed. It's usually that one weird math genius, and then you get majority of autists ending up like my cousin. This is like those videos of someone with some kinda horrible degenerative bone disease going for a hike. You can make anything sound great in a a video, to the point where there are idiots who wish their kids come out \"differently abled\"._ @urgandma¬† I think you missed the point lol_ @urgandma¬† Hey, I play videogames and I got a job anyway. What's your excuse?_ @filipeflower¬† you and more than half the male population do that do exactly that. Your point being?_ @urgandma¬† My point is we shouldn't discriminate autism based on stereotypes, in the same way we shouldn't discriminate different races or homossexuality. Besides, there's lots of females (even autistic ones) who play videogames, so don't stick your mind to stereotypes. I hope you can realize that._ @filipeflower¬† who said anything about discrimination? You see this is what this kind of crap always boils down to. This video, and the various other \"check out my autistic brother, he's awesome!!\" videos are nothing but PR. Mouth breathers discriminate, but bleeding hearts will try to make autism out to be this gift. It is not a good thing to have autism, and you know this because no parent (who is in their right mind) would wish autism on their child. Autism is something you DEAL with, the super autistic aren't even in the room, the mild ones always talk about how they struggle to read emotions. Autism is an unfortunate circumstance, to portray it as anything otherwise is a disservice to those who suffer from it. Inb4 \"I don't suffer, I'm autistic and am a nuclear physicist with a lambo and hot wife.\"_ @urgandma¬† That's your opinion, but there's a lot of Doctors who disagree with you. I happen to be autistic myself and still I have a successful life. Who are you to claim otherwise?_ @filipeflower¬† the family member of someone who is heavily autistic and won't be able to provide for himself once his parents die. It'll fall onto the family or the tax payer, but hey, what does that matter when I got you telling me how great your life is right?_ @urgandma¬† I know very well what you're talking about, but you shouldn't be saying autism is bad, when that stuff has been proven wrong already. Did you know that Albert Einstein was also autistic?_ @filipeflower¬† what are these doctors saying? Are they saying \"it is a benefit to the person's life.\" OR are they saying \"one can learn to live with autism.\" Yes I've heard it, it's the common retort to this. Again, like I said in previous posts, everyone will bring up that math genius or whatever, and forget the loads of kids that are in special ed who literally cannot function. Why would I lie? And assume I am lying, if you know what I'm talking about, then clearly you know of other situations besides this one that I may or may not be making up that actually are true._ @urgandma¬† I am aware of the children who don't function the same way as the  so-called \"normal people\" (subjective term, by the way), but that doesn't excuse your personal prejudice towards it.\nAutistic people can be happy too in life. I am the living example of that. Not only I managed to get myself a permanent job that pays me well (even during state of emergency), but I also have a girlfriend. And I really wanted others to notice this example, so there would be no more disgust towards autistic people. Do you feel that way about homosexuality as well? Similar concept, really._ ‚Äã¬†@filipeflower¬† Not at all a similar concept. Being gay is what you prefer to stick it in, being autistic is a disorder. You could be \"very very gay\" and be fine, but if you're very very autistic... You're an exception, that's it. I am not prejudice, that would mean I have no reason whatsoever to dislike autism (the disorder, not people). I have a very good reason not to like autism, and I've stated it already. If you're high functioning and love your life, then no worries, but don't think for a second that the disorder itself a good thing. Getting major anxiety over smells, noise, or lights is not a good thing. Misunderstanding social cues is not a good thing. If autism is a GOOD thing, then people would purposely be trying to have autistic children, but people try their hardest to prevent that from happening._ @urgandma¬† I mentioned homossexuality as an example of something that used to be considered \"bad\", but it got legalized later on. Same thing will happen with autism. Just because there's a lot of people who aren't autistic, doesn't mean you should change yourself to fit in. You can be the kind of person who you want to be, just as long as you don't do anything bad of illegal.\n\nBut if you're so sure that autism is bad in fact, then please provide scientific sources as to why autism is a disorder and a bad thing, when so many autistic people have jobs and good lives despite what you claim. This should be good entertainment._ @urgandma¬† And by the way, trying to prevent autism is like trying to prevent homossexual children from existing. Good luck with that (sarcasm)._ @filipeflower¬† I'm sure that's what you tell yourself, but anyone who really thinks it through will see that that isn't true. Homosexuality is merely a sexual orientation, homosexuality won't impede your ability to function in the world, except maybe in the middle east or the Bible belt._ @urgandma¬† In short, my point is we shouldn't disrespect people because they're autistic, in the same way we shouldn't disrespect people with different races and different sexual orientation, which used to be considered \"wrong\" years ago. And autism doesn't prevent people from being succesful in life, unless it's severe. In my case, I managed to get my job and my girlfriend despite that._ Wow I love that!!!!_ An autistic person read that and wondered why he wasn't invited to play baseball with you guys._ @aquietviewer6469¬† As if baseball is the most important thing in the world._ I'm not autistic but I can relate üòÇ_ Yeah and then it's harder for you to relate to other people, and also harder for them to relate to you_ @urgandma¬† you are not supposed to be \"impressed\", mate. Its not some kind of competition. This is just our lives. There's this stigma around autism and the guy in the tedtalk is trying to break It. For the longest time autistic people were seen as stupid, and this is just recently changing. Stop antagonizing a minority. You're being just like straight people thinking LGBT are becoming too privileged. The prejudice you are showcasing also has a name, it's ableism. Be better next time._ @ingredi8409¬† Thank you for proving my point._ My daughter is 5 years old and she doesn't speak yet .she is in a french school .and no progress. Her behaviour is like a baby kid .unfortunately._ @evarriska5163¬† What kind of baby kid?_ @ingredi8409¬† thank you, well said_ ‚Äã¬†@urgandma¬† Yikes, what even is this. How can you say somebody is useless and be jealous of them at the same time?_ @ingredi8409¬† nah, I won't \"be better\". Having autism is not a gift, it's a curse. I don't know why this is so hard to grasp, I'm not saying YOU are a curse, I'm saying your condition is. Nobody WANTS to have a child that's autistic, people will DEAL with it if they have to, but no one goes into parenthood hoping their child has a disorder._ @evarriska5163¬† it's gift, according to everyone._ @alakani¬† jealous of who?_ @Dank Dude What're you trying to say?_ @Dank Dude someone with a fair opinion, who'd have thought. However, im not budging on my point: autism is not a good thing, and acting like it is is stupid. Me not liking this fake positivity is not the same as wanting to treat autists like outcasts. Anyone who says otherwise is extremely dishonest and cannot separate the disease from the people who have it._ @urgandma¬† It's a shame that the people you usually covertly bully are too nice to tell you that, actually, you're just too lazy to really care about anyone but yourself, deep down you know it, and you'd rather attack the people who make you notice instead of actually caring or helping. You would rather justify the corrupt, nepotistic, ableist, anti-intellectual, anti-creative economic and political systems that have led directly to the largest wealth and resource gap in history, and to a 20-fold increase in the prevalence of actual psychopathy among CEOs. It's not just autistic people who can't fully take care of themselves, it's a large percentage of the entire past two generations - thanks entirely to rich sociopaths, and their trolls and flying monkeys, like you_ @alakani¬† Wow, you got all that from what boils down to \"autism is not a good thing.\" Believe whatever you want buddy, have your little circle jerks about how great it is to be autistic. You remind me, though to a much weirder degree, of the people from an Insight SBS episode titled \"What are the ethical issues surrounding designing Babies?\" Or the Democratic socialists of America. POINT OF PERSONAL PRIVILEGE\"_ @urgandma¬† I'll have you know that Marshall Matters and Satoshi Tajiri are both autistic, whether you like it or not._ @filipeflower¬† I never knew that Eminem was autistic, and you best believe that was super interesting to hear about. Come to find out, there isn't a single credible source of him being autistic. Literally the only thing is one song where he says Asperger's, and you guys RAN with it to the bank! As for pokemon guy, cool, good for him. Once again, we are in the realm of \"hey, check out this math genius, ignore the guy who can't socialize, has no job, and is literally dependant on his parents til they die.\" You know what, just say my cousin isn't the right kind of autist. You guys are always talking about the super exceptional autistic person, assuming that their autism is what lead to their creativity. I mean we don't have a bunch of non-autistic mangakas and rappers or anything like that, it's the autism that is the key!_ @urgandma¬† Your point being?_ @filipeflower¬† idk, why don't you tell me the point of bringing up Eminem and pokemon guy? Might recontextualize my comment for you. I mean I feel my point was pretty obvious, it's been the same point from the very beginning._ @urgandma¬† So was mine and yet you not only fail to realize that, but you also failed to back up your own comments. It looks like you're hating on autism out of prejudice and ignorance. Also, I asked you a question first, therefore, you have to answer it first. After all that, I'll reply to your \"point\"._ @filipeflower¬† back up my comment? You're the one who fails to see how one thing doesn't immediately invalidate another. \"Autism is not a good thing\" \"There are people who are doing fine with autism.\" THESE 2 POINTS CAN COEXIST, but you just don't want that to be the case. Your point was basic as all heck, you're just playing dumb and refusing to acknowledge mine. \"Oh here's a rapper and mangaka who are successful despite autism, in your face!\" Its the same as your \"I have a girlfriend and a job with autism, HA IN YOUR FACE.\" You outright ignored my previous comment with the stats from an AUTISM ADVOCATE, so really the only fail here is you._ @urgandma¬† Where's that comment exactly? Also, you have yet to answer my question. Also, I'm not playing \"dumb\". Don't accuse me out of random._ @filipeflower¬†  Did you forget everything we've talked about in our past discussions? The fact that you didn't even bother to mention the stat in your previous responses, and don't even know what I'm referencing speaks volumes. Look for the \"Dr. Laurant Mottron\" comment. \n\nWhat question my guy? What my point is? \"AUTISM IS BAD, AUTISM IS NOT A GOOD THING\". The thing that I've been saying the entire time, my goodness. I'm really hoping it's purposeful obtuseness, praying really._ @urgandma¬† Well, given the fact that those comments were written MONTHS AGO (and I also have stuff to do in real life), I wouldn't remember everything about it. Also, that name you just mentioned doesn't give that much information. I suggest you work on your accuracy.\n\nAlso, no need to pray. I happen to be atheist, so I don't believe in God. I don't think he's real.\n\nAnyway, back on topic. You're saying autism is a bad thing, but that's nothing but a negative opinion. You're ignoring every positive example of autism across the world (even my own). You act like autistic people can't have positive lives, when it's already been proven they can. And what exactly are you doing about including autism in societies? Nothing, but discrimination, that's what. You're a bad example of a human being, if you refuse to acknowlegde (or even study) autism. Do more research about it, before commenting with more bullshit, such as the one you said about Marshall (which can be debunked easily)._ @filipeflower¬† ¬†¬†you're really going to try to \"no life\" me when you came back to this comment thread too? You're so full of crap it's hilarious, you double comment (literally hours after your first one), you edit your comments multiple times before I've even responded, but yeah you have so much stuff to do IRL. Uh buddy, you asked what comment I'm talking about, I wrote HIS NAME BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE IT WHEN SCROLLING THROUGH THE COMMENTS. HIS QUOTE IS IN THE COMMENT. You won't type the name into your browser but I got to research your crap? Here you go: nature dot com, Title: the power of autism. Can't wait for you to come back and let me know how great autism is.\n\nI guess I need to explain this to you. I was saying that I'm hoping to god (this is a phrase, I'm also an atheist, so I don't believe in god, if there was a god, he wouldn't make autism, because this is a phrase, people say phrases a lot) that you're being purposely obtuse and not due to other causes. Does this make more sense? I don't believe in god, I'm also an atheist, this is a phrase, got it?\n\nNah buddy, you're refusing to acknowledge anything accept autism is good. I've said time and time again that I don't hate autistic people, I hate the condition. You don't know me, you can't claim I discriminate against autistic people, and frankly since you say that, I'd like to see how you think I discriminate? And you made the claim guy, link me something, ANYTHING. Are you seriously telling me that one of the most high profile rappers is autistic and all I can find are speculative articles referencing one song where he uses the words Aspergers? There is no official statement from him saying so, I've literally searched everything, nothing but reddit, quora, and speculation from people probing into his lyrics and past. But again, assume that Eminem is autistic, SO WHAT?! Good for him! Once again, why do you only focus on the exceptionally gifted or high functioning? Are the low functioning just casualties of war? I guess that as long as we get one Eminem, all the absolute dependents are worth it._ @urgandma¬† Look, right now, it's late night in my country. I have a job to go to tomorrow and I'm not going to waste my sleep time right now just because you want me to. We can talk later after I'm back from work. Until then, be patient._ anc¬† You don't know me, but my comments are enough for you to HATE me. At the end of the day, my comments are far from being the minority, and are plenty reasonable. Hate all you want._ @urgandma¬† So your overall point (despite your initial comments), is that autism is a bad thing. You accept that there are autistic people that are comfortable with themselves and their position in society, but if an autistic person doesn't have a job, struggles to function in society and is dependant on there family like your cousin (or myself), that their value is less, that they ought to be miserable, that they are a burden on society and hardworking taxpayers such as yourself? I'm sure you don't like that framing, you're not a malicious person, most people aren't, but that's how it comes across. As though we are a net negative contribution to the human race. Again, I'm not trying to put words in your mouth, I'm just trying to get some clarity and maybe offer you some perspective.\n\nNow you keep saying you're talking about the disorder and not the individual, but it really isn't something you can separate from the individual. My autism is intrinsically tied to every aspect of my personality, and yeah, a lot of aspects of it suck, but if there were a miracle cure, I would never take it. it'd be like saying, \"hey, do you want to be a different person? how attached are you to your brain?\". Ultimately I would argue that it's redundant to describe the entire spectrum of autism as a bad or a good thing (I don't recall seeing anybody actually describe it as a good thing btw, not in this thread, or anywhere else), it just is what it is. It's too broad, multifaceted and personal to be reduced to that._ @filipeflower¬† but you are high functioning i am so worried about my son just diagnosed with autism and he is 2 . I cry day and night_ I've always thought myself as an \"only outside the box\" thinker.  It's boring to stay in the box._ Cool answerüëç_ @urgandma¬† Ok, I'm back. I had other things to do and I almost forgot about this, but now I'm here. I'll separate my comment into numbered topics to make it easier for you:\n\n1- I don't know what you mean with \"no life\", but I didn't say that. I was explaining that I also have things to do in the real world, which is why I don't spend most of my time here. I have a job and a girlfriend, in case you don't remember. And comming back here doesn't prove anything.\n\n2- I didn't double comment that much, but is there any rule on YouTube against that? If not, why are you trying to condemn me?\n\n3- I didn't edit my comments multiple times. Don't accuse of things that are false (specially when you haven't proven anything). It's bad to do that. And the time of your responses is irrelevant in this case.\n\n4- I already used scroll up and scroll down, but I didn't find it. You're going to have to be more specific than that. And typing his username didn't help either.\n\n5- I already looked at that website you mentioned, but I honestly don't see how this proves your point. Would you please explain this? Also, the fact that you call Autism a bad thing without doing further research about that simply proves your ignorance. Start doing true research, even for one time. The UK NHS website should be a good start.\n\n6- Like I said, I don't believe in God. Therefore, your Christian comments are totally unnecessary. You said you were really praying, but I can see now that you weren't. Which means you said that for no good reason. Which technically counts as lying. I know you said it's a phrase, but not a good one.\n\n7- You said you hate autism, but not the autistic people? That's basically like saying you hate homosexuality, but not the LGBTQ+ people. Same thing! You're just showing how prejudiced and ignorant you are. If you don't like Autism, that's your problem, but at least respect the autistic crowd the same way you would respect the neurotypical people. That hatred is not welcome.\n\n8- As for Eminem being autistic, are you denying your mind to the possibility of that being true? It just looks like you are. Perhaps Eminem didn't say anything about that in public interviews, because he doesn't want to talk about it in an open way in public. Have you considered that? Also, there's a video on YouTube explaining why Eminem is autistic. You said you went through, but I have my doubts. Show me all your sources, then we can talk about that.\n\n9- Now, pay attention. I didn't say anything bad about the so-called \"low-functioning\" autistic people. I'm aware they exist (after all, I met them in my job too). But that doesn't excuse treating those people like garbage. It's not their fault they were born that way. There's actually really good alternative to communicate with what you call \"low functioning\" autistic people. I suggest you either use the Internet more accurately or read a book written by trustworthy professionals. That'll give you more clarity._ @walidsarwary¬† You don't know me, so don't assume things about me without knowing the person you're talking to. Also, show some empathy for your son._ @filipeflower¬† you said you have job and u have girlfriend so it means you are happy with your life so based on autism levels you might be mild autism the more sever the more individual suffer.  So thats why i am worried about my 2 year he is diagnosed with level 2 autism so am very worried._ @walidsarwary¬† Even the (what you call) \"high functioning\" autistic people can have difficulties in their lifes, so I wouldn't assume it's a paradise, if I were you. But then again, even your son can do something in life, if you give him the right tools (among other needs)._ @urgandma¬† As and atheist you could probably agree that we as a species does alot of wasting on stuff that isnt  productive and push the important aside, wars, honour killings, cults, rape, wasting food, obesity, medication on medication, ignoring mental health, work work work, Bullying, shaming, miscommunications, corona. I think everybody can learn to get more stable and hardened, like navy seals, maybe not everybody to the same degree but with more research it could get slot easier, david blake trained himself to be buried alive and hold hisnbreath for like 40 minutes, professioneaIl fighers get used to stressful fights and harden their body so they can take more. Having the attitude that one can change is important i feel, otherwise everyone could just give up and that isnt good either and then everybody is bad, but there are already many that are lost bcuz of the mental health epidemic, lot of people learn eatchother that shame is the way but shame makes it hard for addicts to stop doing whatever, shame doesnt help anyone and doesnt motivate anyone. How many normal people get wellfair checks,and do tax fraud, rob people,loot, gets children for extra checks. Theres alot of migrants that after 10 years dont get a normal paying job in Sweden, homeless people, people who literally grind their teeth down on tiktok, people who only live for partying and dont consider other people, gold diggers, so much burdens but i think that to nurture people is still the way to go. Theres a video with a downed syndrome person who has 2 really smart parents and he is fit,a gymnast and he goes to like university and thats bcuz of the parents nurture if wed be like Sweden in 1930 to 1975killing gays,immigrants, old sick people for wellfair then it wouldnt be a step forward but now the wellfair is being raped and stretched real thin.. giving away tax payers money to Spain, alot on immigrants who is not self sufficient even after 10 years. Normal people are smart therefor they miscommunicate alot bcuz they never tell people how to fit in and gets suprised when people dont know what to do, they are so good att social interactions that if the move to another country they also in many cases gets cut off and dont know what to do, if social inteligence is a good indicater of what bad and good is then normal people with social anxiety are facked also, society doesnt teach people how to learn, doesnt speak about how to fit in and the only thing saving somebody is if their socially liked or not, a person that has adhd and wrecks the classroom and party all the time can be fine but even then they can end up a without a job also and like you say be a burden, theres more things then just autism to point out, theres many many people with personality disorders, some born with some they get from neglecting persons for instance, how many typical people dont know anything, sit on their phone all the time and have no empathy for others? a bunch, there also burdens and dont contribute, humans find all ways to fack eathother over psically and mentally, we are nice, evil, murderers, we fake injurees for wellfair, people sell their kids in the Philipeans._ @Dank Dude Could you please explain that more accurately?_ @urgandma¬† No it's not meant to be profound it's meant to express an understanding of what autism is in the simplest way possible whilst simultaneously being a plea for acceptance rather than perpetuating the idea that it's a disorder or disease. And it does both these things in a simple sentence. That it sounds profound is a symptom of the fact that its achieves its intended purpose to perfection.\n\nWhile the same statement applies to the scenario of normal people working in a team, it applies to the original scenario (autism) in a way which is not equivelant. This is the ambiguity of natural langauage. It's up to you the reader to apply context to disambiguate the intended meaning.\n\nIn the scenario of a team of non-autistic individuals the factor is cumulative perception and its lack in each individual according to their random idiosyncrasies, biases, strengths, weakness and so on. \n\nIn an autistic person these idiosyncracies are not random and symptoms of something which is happening in a dramtically different way to the average person. So much so that it can seem like they are highly deficient in several important human functionalities. That is the meaning of the first half of the statement.\n\nThe other half of the statement seeks to complete the incomplete undertanding by pointing out they we catch what others miss. And similarly, to people who know the person well, its just as persistent, noticeable and often very useful.\n\nTo put it simply, if you ever assemble a team of people with complimentary strengths and weaknesses, depending on the task you might want to consider including the \"spazz\" as a high risk/cost high reward investment where it applies. And in modern civilization and society it often does.\n\nNot so much about being special or better than normal, but highly specialized in a certain and indetifiable way.\n\nA petrol sedan vs a petrol hatchback vs diesel truck vs an electric scooter. All of these things are basic modes of transportation with different strengths but one of them stands out quite abit more than the others yet all are valid and useful. And some of them aren't scooters they're Teslas. As for me I'm a scooter._ @urgandma¬† get him a PC and some books on coding and let him make the games. Or find out what he's good at. One of the strengths is that we don't get bored doing the same thing forever. If you can find him something to do of any value he may master it and mastery is neither common nor void of value._ @russelltalker¬† Ignore UhHuh. It's just another anti-autism troll._ @urgandma¬† it also applies to fishing._ @theymademepickaname1248¬† Explain that more accurately, please._ @urgandma¬† \nYou only see autism as bad because of arrogance and pride, if you're not autistic and put more thought into it you would know autistic people perceive differently to you, I have a nextdoor neighbor with an autistic unverbal grandson and his grandson doesn't mind being unverbal at all.\n\nDo more studying of autism and you will come to see the good as well as the difficulties, if you put more thought into it you would realise the majority of suffering and difficulties autistic people experience is all thanks to the selfishness of neurotypical people.\n\nLook into the neuroscience of autism, see which brain regions vary and what those regions control and see autistic people have abilities that not one nonautistic person is capable of.\n\nIn neurotypical people, there's low-functioning brain regions as well, some brain regions in an autistic brain are far more functional, creative and advanced compared to a neurotypical brain.\n\nMuch to learn you still have, and much to unlearn you still have._ @walidsarwary¬† \nJust because you perceive something as not good does not mean your child will, autism makes us perceive differently to you. The reason we don't always accept your perspective is the fact the perspectives and ways nonautistic people do things are unsuitable for those of us on the spectrum, some of your ways are harmful to us. Let's take eye contact as an example, those who don't make eye contact don't do so because it causes them great anxiety just like people with social anxiety, so when they're forced to make eye contact they're being forced into a state of great anxiety leading to mental illnesses. Those of us on the spectrum are anchored to all the stimulus around us while nonautistic people are not, this is why autistic people are more easily overstimulated.\n\nOf course it's ok to be concerned about your child, I would say that's a parent's responsibility, but you must acknowledge your ways are not always suitable for us and that we think and perceive in a less related way to nonautistic people._ @danielmoore4024¬† That person is another anti-autism troll. I dealt with that user before._ @Karen Johnson \nAutism doesn't catch a thing, autism is a way of being, natural neurodevelopment.\nThere's lots and lots that you can't see that those of us on The Autism Spectrum can see. We can focus at a far higher degree that not one nonautistic person is capable of. We have detail orientation unlike nonautistic people.\n\nThere's lots we can do that you can't, all the difficulties people autistic, ADHD, dyslexia, down syndrome etc. are all compensated by neurodivergence._ @Karen Johnson It's more than just a disability, actually. It's already been proven. Search it on Google._ @Karen Johnson Did you also tried looking at other sources from other countries?_ @Karen Johnson You're avoiding my question._ @Karen Johnson Yes, you did. You didn't show your other sources from other countries (if you have those)._ @Karen Johnson the people who think autism is a good thing are beyond help. The only bit of sanity I have to grasp onto is knowing that this video and this comment section are an echo chamber of autists and their advocates. The rest of the world DEFINITELY doesn't buy any of it, and there will never be a push to have autism be the norm, except for your occasional virtue signal from people too afraid to say how they really feel, despite never wanting autistic children themselves._ @urgandma¬† That's your opinion. You can't really speak for everyone._ @Karen Johnson \nSo what if autism is called a disability, that's nothing but a reflection of cultural prejudice and evidence of the pride, arrogance and hypocrisy of neurotypical people.\n\nYou're claiming you trust the internet, well professionals and neuroscientists are the ones who claim autistic people have the ability to hyper-focus, as an autistic person myself I can witness that true as someone who stays focused and working for over 12 hours on one goal without taking a break.\n\nThe lack of the frontal area of the brain reduces social sensitivity protecting us from peer pressure, we are not as vulnerable as you to peer pressure.\n\nThe lack of the frontal area is compensated by the back of the brain creating more of a thinking cognitive system while you're stuck with a social cognitive system giving you a great lack of thinking and makes autistic people greater thinkers than neurotypical people.\n\nAutistic people use the left hemisphere more than the right, as a consequence we are made detail oriented, more analytical, more logical, more focused.\n\nThose of us autistic lack the filter giving us the ability to hold more information and increases our consciousness while you have a lack of consciousness.\n\nThose of us autistic are anchored to the present stimulus around us increasing our awareness and keeps us in the moment while your head is wondering off hardly seeing anything around you.\n\nBecause of neuroscience showing autistic brains function in a systematic way and have the ability to hyper-focus and deeper thinking, scientists have hypothesised that 90% of the technological inventions we have today came from minds of people on The Autism Spectrum.\n\nBecause you think in the so called \"normal\" way you only think of normal day to day things, nothing new or creative. Neurodivergent people are always out of the box;\nAlbert Einstein (Autism)\nJohn Nash (Schizophrenia)\nRichard Branson (Dyslexia)\nL. V. Beethoven (Bipolar)\nBach (ADHD)\nMozart (Autism)\n\nHow many people are greatly influenced by their works? How different, abnormal was their work for people in their time?\n\nThere's a big ongoing debate on whether these are disabilities or not, many professionals like PhD. Thomas Armstrong see these as part of \"The Human-Ability Spectrum\" and sees neurodivergent people as \"Differently-Abled\" and not \"Dis-Abled\".\n\nYou're not \"Able\", you're \"En-Abled.\"\n\nTalking about getting jobs, the reason autistic people don't have jobs is because of employment discrimination and the mindlessness of neurotypical people._ @danielmoore4024¬† Thank you for that explanation, Daniel._ @urgandma¬† \nIf no one wants autistic people in the world, why do we have professionals writing books fighting for the acceptance of autism?\nWhy do we have professionals saying not employing autistic people is a waste of talent and skills?  \nWhy is there an ongoing debate between professionals of The Neurodiversity Movement?\n\nThat's just a few things going on in life that shows it's not only those of us autistic who see autism can be turned into and used as an asset of high value._ @danielmoore4024¬† cool, once again we are in the realm of that math genius and ignoring the sheer amount of autistic people who are incapable of doing such. So while my cousin sits in his room for the rest of his life (until his parents die, then he'll live in a facility where the state will fund his existence) playing video games, you and all the other autists will be bring carbon nano tubes to the masses! Yo you should go and talk to all the huge corporations, apparently they don't like making money, all this autistic talent going to waste out here._ @urgandma¬† Even those people deserve appropriate support. You don't seem to be that kind of person._ Do you.guys have autism the ones right now discussing the issue?? If you guys are , you seem.very intelligent_ @filipeflower¬† do you think society is a giant blank check? We don't have the luxury of just throwing money at stuff, but I guess that doesn't matter because of your feelings. You're easily one of the most annoying people I've ever had the displeasure of talking to, extremely bad faith, frequently puts words in my mouth, calls me a troll for not agreeing with you, and worst of all, even after I've stopped replying to you, you keep talking to me. Go back to work, touch grass, whatever._ @walidsarwary¬† I happen to be Autistic myself, just like Daniel Moore._ @urgandma¬† First of all, I didn't put words in your mouth. Don't throw accusations out of nowhere. Secondly, if you wasted plenty of money on unnecessary stuff, that's your problem, not ours. And third, in the same way you can express what you want, I can do the same. Or did you think that only applies to yourself?_ @walidsarwary¬† \nIf you're asking me, I am autistic and I and others see autism as good and part of our identity. I come across autistic people say I quote \"I'm autistic, but I love it, I embrace it, I can no longer align myself with the word disabled.\" close quote.\n\nThe autistic mind is a specialist mind, brilliant at one thing but terrible at another. All autistic people are extremely knowledgeable about what they're interested in because they're hyper-focused on it and that's why special/obsessive interest is a symptom of autism.\nWhen 9 years old I became interested in autism, over 20 years later I'm still engaged with autism._ @TheSimonScowl¬† dude you enlightened me, I love you man, I'm fucking serious\n\nBoth you and the OP of the comment, u'r angels_ I caught a grammar mistake lol you are right._ @robsomner476¬† That's a pretty lame joke._ Just perfect_ @urgandma¬† as a mother of an autistic son, I found it very profound. Maybe you‚Äôre the one lacking depth?_ @meagain1112¬† as the relative of a person with crippling autism who will be at the teat of the tax payer for years to come (I can also preface a statement with emotional bs too), I found it to be nothing to write home about. Maybe you're easily impressed?_ @urgandma¬† You're more worried about the money than anything else._ @urgandma¬† Maybe he didn't catch that, and you missed his point._ @filipeflower¬† There you go ahead butting your head where you're not wanted. You don't care about it at all, let alone the human effort and suffering that comes along with it, and why would you? Welfare recipients don't care where the money comes from so long as they get their check. At first I was wondering why you're so obsessed, but then I remembered and it made all the sense in the world._ @BolasDaGrk¬† please enlighten me as to his point, apparently it's deeper than, \"I see things from a different perspective.\"_ @urgandma¬† ...Your point?_ @urgandma¬† By the way, this is a public comment thread. Anyone can comment. Who are you to decide who's not wanted?_ @filipeflower¬† you've said this already, you are allowed to do whatever you want, but it says a lot that you can continue to keep talking to someone who wants nothing to do with you. We've said all that we have to say, you don't agree with me, and I don't agree with you. You're never going to convince me otherwise, so stop being obsessively your brain wiring and go away._ @urgandma¬† Convince you of what exactly? What're you talking about?_ @filipeflower¬† ok, Mr forgetful, please go away, you're annoying._ @urgandma¬† I'm not trying to annoy you._ that's not what it means at all. you're completely wrong. I was diagnosed with autism btw_ Yes that is me._ as another autistic person yee this is 100% correct lul_ @urgandma¬† Yes. And it is. Stay mad lol._ @urgandma¬† sir really said homosexuality was a choice ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°_ @lgbthc231¬† Only ones mad are the people trying their darndest to act like autism is amazing, when everyone knows it's not. Where did I say it's a choice?_ @filipeflower¬† UhHuh keeps putting words in your mouth, saying that you‚Äôre trying to make Autism out to a gift, when that‚Äôs literally not what you said, not even once._ @urgandma¬† and you said it was a preference. Which‚Ä¶means you‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs a choice. And you‚Äôre definitely not saying it‚Äôs not, so‚Ä¶‚òïÔ∏è_ @lgbthc231¬† Wow, you're right! I did mess up there, I mean I quite literally said in another comment \"Homosexuality is merely a sexual orientation\" (convenient that you wouldn't bother checking), but excuse me for making a mistake. So now that we're past that, anything else you gotta say?_ @urgandma¬† I had a whole comment you just plain out ignored, but go off! ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°_ @urgandma¬† convenient you totally ignored my previous comment._ @lgbthc231¬†  What comment? The one where you tagged someone else?_ @urgandma¬† literally scroll up. It‚Äôs not rocket science._ @lgbthc231¬† ¬†Your first has literally no context, you could've responded to any one of my many comments. 2nd and 3rd were addressed, and then you respond to Filipe. This ain't TikTok, elaborate on your points and stop using emojis._ @urgandma¬† since you wanna play dumb, I can play dumb too :))))_ @urgandma¬† Don't dictate how others comment._ Well said_ @urgandma¬† \nIf you want a better future for your relative give it up with your ableism and discrimination, stop sabotaging him with your ableist views. \n\nAll these things now defined as \"autism traits\" were always happening, why weren't they seen as problems before 1940?\n\nThere's two reasons for that, one, nonautistic people ironically practice the very same behaviours labelled \"autism trait.\"\nSecondly, because we didn't have \"normal people\" like you sabotaging them they were not sabotaged into requiring full-time residential care. \n\nYour ableism is your problem but you don't seem able to take responsibility for your own ableism. It's because of people like you why autistic people are defined by what they can't do, like you haven't been able to tell us anything good about your relative but you have confessed to us you wish he was not your relative and no one would want him to be.\n\nTalk about lacking empathy as you lean on stereotypes, you wishing your own relative didn't exist and define him by what he can't do, that doesn't seem emphatic to me._ @danielmoore4024¬† Thank you for bringing that up._ Dr Yuching Lee¬† \nThere is no cure for autism, autism is neurological and herbs do not rewire or give brain and genetic transplants.\nThere's enough rumours already, don't bother making more.\n\nAnd the truth is we don't suffer from autism, we suffer because of you, you and the society are our disability. We can look through all the suffering autistic people experience and we see the vast majority of that suffering has nothing to do with autism, but everything to do with the society's obsession with the mythical \"normal\" person._ @danielmoore4024¬† That Dr Yuching Lee user has been spamming that same comment on other videos. He has no life._ This is now one of my favourite quotes of all time_ As a dad of an autistic son, I completely agree with that statement_ @urgandma¬† are you close to anyone on The Who is autistic?_ @jordancooper8248¬† my cousin_ @urgandma¬† I will give you something. You have kept to your conviction for the last year on this thread. I wish you and your cousin well._ @KnockoutVr-g6i¬† surprising, best to you and yours as well._ @urgandma¬† I just asked because my son is autistic and I agree a lot with Abu said.  My boy would see a stop sign and say octagon when he was 3. I‚Äôm not trying to be combative I was just curious why you don‚Äôt agree with the original comment_ Exactly._ @jordancooper8248¬† \nIt's what they call \"bottom to top\" thinking. \n\nNonautistic people are \"top to bottom\" thinkers, concept first, address details later.\n\nImagine we just took all the jigsaw pieces out of the box and put the lid back on.\nAn autistic mind would attend the jigsaw pieces one by one while a nonautistic person would see the full picture on the box. \nOnce the autistic person has attended all the details they put it all together and then they see the big picture. This can obviously be debilitating in situations by not seeing the concept first, but in certain activities and tasks it can be an asset bottom to top thinking.\n\nNot all, but so many aspects of autism can be used as assets in certain activities and that's the direction we need to send autistic children in, we need to put a bigger emphasis on what they can do no matter how little it may seem._ fr_ That's perfect! Same for me. I have an auditory processing problem that I've had all my life. I had very bad ear problems as a child. I had tubes put in my ears when I was 3 and had them removed when I was 6. They were for swimmers' ear, for very small ear canals. I had a lot of terrible earaches, and they didn't go away when the tubes were removed. I learned early on that I could not rely on my ears. I try my best to understand people, but it's difficult. Also, if there is background noise, I can barely hear them at all. It's not because I can't focus, but that my brain cannot filter out certain sounds. It's not just background music. Something like a fan or air conditioner can make it impossible for me to hear clearly. I notice this if I watch TV or a movie. If the air conditioner is on, I have to turn the TV almost all the way up. This annoys my mother and brother whom I live with. I've had my ears tested more times than I can count up till I was in high school. I was diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum with auditory processing problems when I was about 13. I was sent to a place after school in West Los Angeles called Child's. It's not around anymore. But I would go there for two years once or twice a week. They were always doing hearing tests and psychological tests like Rorschach or showing me pictures and asking me what I noticed about them. I've struggled to make any kind of living and I'm now 48. At several jobs from working in supermarkets to bookstores I have come close to being fired when I couldn't understand what my employer was saying over the PA system. I have to find a kind of work I can do from home. I am very good when it comes to writing, I write science fiction novels and stories, I am very good with computers, and I also play music, mostly guitar, which I have been playing since I was twelve. I started with piano at six when a Montessori school I attended had free piano lessons. Then trumpet at nine and guitar at twelve, which I love most of all._ @JeffSmith03¬† So much of our modern world would simply fail to function without the unique skills of autistic people who can understand very complex processes._ omg that's true  That comment hit me right between the eyes like a sledge hammer._ @urgandma¬† it's more profound than you think.  Do you have Autism?  If you do, you would know exactly what this person is saying.  I have Autism and I can spot the smallest spelling mistake on a 300 word page instantly just by scanning across the page quickly.   Neuro typicals probably can't do that.  Think of Data from Star Trek._ Hehe, yeah.\n\ndouble meanings are fucking weird for me to understand_ Absolutely ‚ù§Ô∏è_ i have autism_ Said perfectly_ No wonder I‚Äôm so good at Pictionary lol_ @theworthysoul¬† Same bro_ @The_Tiffster¬† yes_ That‚Äôs exactly how my parents describe me lmaoo_ @urgandma¬† I see someone‚Äôs spent too much time on r/iam14andthisisdeep. And before you ask, yes I am autistic, no I don‚Äôt have Reddit, I just watch Reddit YT._ @SuperSonic1116¬† the point damn well flew over his head and landed somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean_ @urgandma¬† You make a good point, but as someone autistic, it was pretty hard to accept it at first. Then I just‚Ä¶got used to it. Now I view my autism as part of me. It‚Äôs just another weird side of me, hyperactive, hyperfocused, somewhat weird. It‚Äôs me. I am my autism, my autism is me._ @tartaglia.¬† you're gonna have to quote something, there's a massive backlog of comments and I have no idea what you're referring to. As for reddit... Yeah that's full of *you know what I'm gonna say*s as moderators who would probably ban me for hate speech.

Good for you. Question: do you ever find yourself stereotyping the stereotypers? Just askin'_ Honest Person¬† ƒë k\nL_ Aaron Cyrus Educational agree!_ Honest Person¬† Its more that autism is a spectrum disorder. The media like to focus on a specific set of traits, and when dealing with a spectrum, you cant focus in only a few things, and not a broader range of synptoms. Thats why i think if the media presentation of autism as a stereotype._ Honest Person¬† always about getting to know a person you meet and not assume you already know by things you heard_ Honest Person¬† how is experience \"making it up\"? I am autistic, I am who I am. But it is y'all who made up that label, that perspective not me._ Honest Person¬† i never said that. I just said since its called ASD (autism SPECTRUM disorder) than everyone experiences it differently, and they cant be fit into the very specific bozes the media puts them in. I dont know more than someone who wrote a book on it, but i can speak from persinal experience, from having groups of friends who are also autistic, and from everything my Occupational Therapist told me._ Its complicated, I mean, √± professionals struggles to get straight statements about autism._ Stereotypes can be accurate though. It just depends on whether they're based in Science or at least observation, or are merely hostile disinformation.\nFor instance, most autistic people are male. The fact that in the media they nearly always have a (probably misdiagnosed) autistic woman do the talking is insulting to autistic men. It's not progressive, or left-wing; it's just intersectional fascism, where the subjective struggles of more powerful groups distort representations to further increase their power, funded by the state, dominating civil society, transforming discourse into histoire. We must loudly critique this bourgeouis cappuccino-drinking ideology._ @paradigmarson9586¬† damn, put that tinfoil away_ @paradigmarson9586¬† What's your point?_ @paradigmarson9586¬† \n\"Most Autistic people are male\" cannot be confirmed true.\nWhat can be confirmed true is the diagnostic criteria of the DSM 5 is gender bias, it is based on the behaviour of Autistic men. For over a century the professionals assumed it to be a male condition.\n\nThe tests for a diagnosis fails females, females either get missed entirely, misdiagnosed several times before an actual diagnosis of Autism and some have been tested over 5 times. They were already autistic but the tests for a diagnosis claimed they weren't autistic.\n\nNot long ago 150,000 random people from around the country were tested, they came to find that 70% of the autistic people were not diagnosed with the majority of them being females.\n\nMore cases keep showing the professionals are going to have to revise the DSM 5._ Who isn't?!

Milkweed is a host plant AND a nectar plant (think house and food) so it's good to have a mix of both host plants (milkweed) and nectar plants (food for butterflies)_ @Masaomi84¬† i love that you asked this , bright blessings dear soul._ Laura Lafauve¬† bravo , i love your comment._ @ivyleagueadventures9572¬† yours is an informative and encouraging comment , bright blessings dear soul._ Thanks for asking, and thank you ILA for explaining your experience.  Isn‚Äôt it just the best?  At the moment I live on an organic farm in Kentucky, and we do grow lots of milkweed.  We also raise bees, so we like to keep all of the pollinators happy and fed well.  We also hatch eggs (which it can be very easy or very difficult to find) from various hatcheries(? I guess?).  Lol.  You can bring in Monarchs almost anywhere in their range, though.  Plant a little milkweed, and eventually they will come.  Just keep an eye for the caterpillars, because if you get too many, they will run through their plants and you won‚Äôt have time to get more.  Don‚Äôt want that to happen.  üòä_ Ê∫úÁµêÈõ® while I understand the concern, I live on a 1200 acre organic farm.  It also houses a native wildlife sanctuary and rescue.  The property has cultivated milkweed (obviously many other native plants) for almost a century.  Monarchs come whether we help them along, or not.  \n\nAgain, brilliant to mention, but not all captive breeding is going to be the same._ April Xie well, I hope it was.  It‚Äôs lovely to see it out in the wild.  Maybe that will be the start for the next generation._ hOW DO YOU GET THEM? My milkweeds are vacant._ @johnsarab4500¬† we order them through our state.

The recent interest in forgiveness and law reflects widespread dissatisfaction in the equation of justice with adversarial litigation. But we should be careful about embracing the move toward forgiveness, for our commitment to the rule of law often depends upon adversarial litigation for enforcement.\n\nIt almost goes without saying that the dissatisfaction with conventional adversarial litigation is wide-ranging. Not only is it costly and time-consuming, such litigation also is isolating, impersonal, and potentially destructive of human ties. It offers limited or constrained roles for actual parties. It requires that people put aside the totality and complexity of their identities, needs, and beliefs in order to translate the conflict into legal terms. Its process and even its substance seem arcane, remote, harsh and divisive, even if it is principled, formal, neutral and fair._ So lovely watching and listening to you here on the top of Trentino Italy mountain._ Thank you so much for talking of this argument.

What about people who manipulate the system and exploit forgiveness to continue criminal activity? The number of murders that have occured because a killer was released prematurely is unacceptable and cannot be allowed to continue. \"Tuned to fairness\" is such a lazily vague qualification, perhaps she should go back to the drawing board and think a bit more before speaking._ I can't forgive homophobes, they are too awful to be in our society._ WHY ARE THERE PPL?!_ Good work , provided subtitles thank you üôè_ Blanket forgiveness and Write-off debts... at whose expense? Not the government‚Äôs or wealthy people who continue to keep and accumulate their own wealth, but those earning average or less paying for this. These are solutions are for early interventions in milder environments, she doesn‚Äôt sound like she has experience in the toughest neighbourhoods where you have to overcome the whole environment and those who don‚Äôt think or are motivated or incentivised by the same thing she assumes... hence this idea is so limited to a more complex set of causes that should be solved in the first place. The wealthiest organisations have an indirect part to play in this state of society because of how they take advantage of the average citizen either through labour, consumerism or basic resources like energy (gas, electricity, petrol, infrastructure) that everyone relies on in everyday life and have to pay them for. Look at how mafias and gangs operate that influence families in poverty neighbourhoods, look at the murderers who were brought up in wealthy backgrounds with parents who thought they brought them up well, and look at the victims the type of criminals target and why. There are so many different cases, incentive is a mix of motivational incentives and deterrents for them to respond positively. Justice needs to be relatively balanced for the victim and the type of criminal behaviour too, and therefore justice also should be fairly and proportionately represented._ Lady if you were to go to a violent psychopathic man who has killed many you wouldnt think about forgiveness you'd be running.

Help the killers!!!!!\n\nIn the past we consider \"make an example\" so people will learn, \"if people fear the wrath of the court they won't do bad things\" , this is WRONG!!!!!\n\nWe need to educate differently, we need to expose in each case the real causes (mostly external to the killer).\nIf we do that, then, it's less about \"forgiving the person\", it's more about \"not lying to yourself\" that the \"person\" is the cause, and more about assigning blame to a correct set of systems.\nWhen you do that, sure, no one to be angry at, only non physical \"system\".\nBut, just like any story, you start to realize (from learning the story of the \"broken systems\") that those systems are alive, and changing, \nand you can almost relate to them as you do to people, hate and forgiveness to the system.\n\n\nI want to here about the true evil in court, I want the government to expose to us these systems a lot more, like kid stories, like life lessons, point the blame there!!!! (the system) and forgiveness should come more easily I feel._ Seriously.. ??  this woman is allowed to teach our youth.. \nDelusionally Naive  is an understatement._ Society is diverse, people will try to survive in the pressures given by their inherited social levels. Due to the diverse environment, competition cause people to have depictional concepts to rank in competition, it's what is depicted that creates the bias. In forms of social frequencies. \"She is definitely not psychologist, but the professor sure can put together a statistical hypothesis\". Social Image conflicts w/ competition, we are bound to a diverse individual functionalism. Each & every personality has a frequency, like different types of magnets & metals that can reprogram it's own molecules, the social diversity separates us in pairs or incrowds. These conditions given to society will only hinder the inevitable, social level segregation. Where each level has its own political command, it's own ethical commerce. Where all will be dependant on its pairable community. It's like stigma, but realistically, it's a individual functionalism that is perceived to the individuals preference.

Thanks in advance._ Unity in Diversity_ I don't think I could forgive someone who murdered my brother with premeditated intent, but people make mistakes. If it was an accident and they were remorseful it only further hurts you to hold on to that resentment._ As long as we learn from what we forgive for ?_ Watch it too \nVery useful_ https://youtu.be/GHqYmY5Igkw_ Care based morality gets you nowhere because its not effective against those who dont care. Care based morality is the morality of a child that hasnt yet discovered that closing his eyes to banish the monsters under his bed does only work if there are no monsters. \n\n\nA criminal act is not an act of erring, its an intentional act that is carried out against a rule that, if violated, bears consequences. If forgiveness is favored over consequences, the rules that governs society start to decay, because the fear of the consequences that inhibit those who dont care decays with it, setting them free to exploit your kindness as they wish._ No._ Commendable sentiment_ Only someone who has never been truly hurt and abused by people, who have never had to answer for what they've done and who continue to revel in their actions, could regard forgiveness as a instant virtue.  Forgiveness is little more than imagery, virtue signalling through clenched teeth._ Actually, as she mentioned, when you research our financial laws, you'll see a good portion are rooted in the laws of the Bible. They are not used often enough. She has a very valid point. It's not a just system, not balanced._ Tell this to Kim Jong Un._ it took 50 seconds until race came into discussion_ I can appreciate your points and hear that you have left room in for wisdom and balance.\nFor me, I choose to forgive because it's an easier path. Anger, bitterness, resentment, score keeping, etc., keep me stuck in the \"story\" of the offense(s) and robs me of my own resilience. \nI can choose to allow any situation to be for my highest best. I haven't had to deal with murder, but I have been on the \"wrong end\" of a number of moral and criminal violations -- all difficult opportunities I choose to be for my growth, my highest best. \nHolding on to resentment, bitterness, my right to hurt feelings, anger, justice, etc. only hurts me. It robs me of my compassion, my growth, my joy, my best life, my peace, etc.\nI'm not a religious person, but I am deeply spiritual. In the many faith traditions I've been exposed to, forgiveness seems to be a common thread in one's spiritual unfoldment -- becoming your highest best. We don't have to \"be one of them\" to learn from their faith traditions. There are also countless self-help teachers who teach that releasing our right to be hurt, angry, wronged, bitter, resentful, seeking justice, etc. sets us free from the past and allows us to move forward and live life to the fullest. \nIsn't that what we all want?\nAll that said, I have forgiven, but not without wisdom. In some cases, it's just not a good idea for a predator to be free. Some crimes, for safety or the greater good, demand appropriate consequences.\nFor me, forgiveness is the first step to self-compassion. From self-compassion, there is nothing but love. \nJust a thought, \"Love is patient and kind. Love is not jealous or boastful or proud or rude. It does not demand its own way. It is not irritable, and it keeps no record of being wronged. It does not rejoice about injustice but rejoices whenever the truth wins out. Love never gives up, never loses faith, is always hopeful, and endures through every circumstance.\"_ üòç_ Thanx everyday_ I forgave many who have hurt me deeply, not for them but for my own sake. Its not as satisfying in this physical life, but it will all be worth it in the afterlife_ I absolutely love how the talks are real and relatable. I would love if you guys could show some love and support to my this YouTube adventure. I'm a medical student from India._ We need to balance forgiveness and justice, with the higher value in mind of creating the kind of society we want to live in. That means holding people accountable, but allowing them to be as imperfect as we are ourselves. \n\nTo create a just system of forgiveness would be to create a system that allows forgiveness but that doesn‚Äôt discriminate or favor people in the way that humans do. In a system administered by humans, that‚Äôs a tough challenge. That‚Äôs why we do that on a case by case basis. \n\nThe person who was wronged should have the opportunity to extend forgiveness or call for an appropriate punishment, but the system is correct that the defendant should still have the opportunity to face their accuser. The truth should be revealed, and with compassion, we should make decisions that take everyone‚Äôs best interest into account. It‚Äôs a difficult balance to strike, but we should aim for that._ Race is super important when it comes to criminal justice._ This is snowflake propaganda_ No this is not gonna work_ It's amazing what our society can do when we just don't wipe 'messes' to the side._ All this inspirational speech about forgiveness when there is financial sabotage of the masses by the ruling class during this reset........how convenient._ The legal system is for profit and makes a lot of money out of every person they accuse of a crime.

And even if I did that has nothing to do with the punishment that person should receive from the justice system. Two different things._ great talk_ The realization of no victim no crime would be a positive addition to the legal system ._ The current system isn't working... It should be evident since a large % of people in prison, are repeat offenders... How is it that we still think severe punishment is the way to go?\n\n\nIt's like yelling at your child continually until they cry... The child is may stop doing what you don't want it to do, but with emotional scarring to go with it... And sometimes they'll do it even more because they resent you instead...\n\n\nActual therapy and interventions can help so many people who are broken, and can stop so many repeat offenders I believe. And if these interventions were to be done before a person goes to jail, even better._ Forgiveness is up to victims, not to judges or governors._ I forgive you for being such a moron._ Garbage anecdotal stories. Teaching for forty years you say...? Sounds about right...I have been working with law enforcement for 13 years, your information is outdated and incomplete. Justice and forgiveness are two separate things. It is not the realm of judges to forgive for the same reasons it was not the realm of victim to mete out justice. Forgiveness is good, but you have conflated far too much within the realm of law._ Well this theme isnt for germans. We have an other justice system. We are trying to reintegrate the criminal persons back into society independent of what they did. The benefits are huge in the opposite to the countries where the people have to be punished and to suffer for they faults. I'm  working with children and teens which are on the best way to commit they first crime with 14. It's taking time and a lot of money but it will pay itself. I saw a couple documentaries about US justice officials visiting german jails, seemed promising to me. So hope you will be able to reform your system and then more to change your point of view on this theme. I also saw the court story about the illegal killing, moved me a lot as well._ It is more righteous to be sympathetic than forgiving.\n\nSympathy:\nA feeling of pity or sorrow for the distress of another.\n\nForgive:\nTo give up resentment against or stop wanting to punish (someone) for an offense or fault; pardon._ Definitely at this point ted just lets anyone in as long as they can form a sentence or two anything for views even if its dangerous and useless information_ Crashes the economy because of housing market fraud: \n\"Nah its an honest mistake don't worry about it\" \n\nSmokes one weed:\n\"Do it...

And if your answer is \"society\", if you think about it, you can use the idea of \"crimes against society\" for almost anything.. and all of a sudden, you have gone full circle and start prosecuting 'crimes' with no victims.._ Well in males they're typically worldwide more violent unfortunately.  It is due to genetics and the amygdala and evolution.  So fixing them can be almost impossible without drugs of some sort some are genetics. We cant forgive some, that way of thinking of investing in everyone who is in prison is dangerous there is no clear solution_ @ishthefish9006¬† I think you may be confusing violent with aggressive/competitive... Men are not inherently violent per say, but yes genetics does seem to suggest maybe they are more competitive or aggressive. Even this isn't really \"fact\" per say because there is no objective standard, people from different cultures are all varying levels of aggressiveness/competitiveness, whichever gender._ Violence is neccessary.  In men we are genetically hardwired to be hard and kill. Unfortunately it is why 79 perecnt of crime is male gene. How can we control our genetics and buile a better society if evil is wanting break out ?_ and how can we forgive someone if they never asked for our forgiveness in the first place?_ Once you take someones human rights away from someone else\nThat's abuse, murder, rape eact\nThen they don't deserve their human right\nYou can forgive, once you make the world a safer place, by deleting them off this earth_ This is exactly the wisdom we need ..a thriving society is built on the cornerstone of principles such as the wisdom of forgiveness .. the quality of mercy is not strained.. we know this .. the issue is private prisons make immense profit from incarceration . And politicians get campaign funds from the billionaires if they run on being tough on crime. \nWe are already suffering the consequences of this greed and ruthlessness but no one more than the poor [now a majority] and the minorities and none more than black and Hispanic people. Its heart breaking the amount of young lives devastated by this greed._ \"Forgiveness is not forgetting. Forgiveness is not overlooking difficulties you have had with people in the past, for that becomes emotionally and intellectually dishonest. You cannot make something good that was not good without deceiving yourself and becoming dishonest regarding your feelings. Forgiveness here must be something that enables you to see another person clearly and to derive learning from that experience, from that relationship.\"\nA quote from a teaching titled Healing Relationships, which you can read or listen to in its entirety at NewMessage ORG_ I just think Jim quick should do this for free. Oh my what ever etc. Because it will benefit the hole humanity. If Volvo haven‚Äôt free the 3 points impact belts so many more people would have lost their life.

Usa is basically incarcerating people with mental health problems and it's way more expensive than having a proper early education program and mental health care._ There is no union between forgiveness and justice. They are separate and distinct. Forgiveness is given by the victim. Justice is given by the state. Mix the two and you have unbridled ANARCHY ! To suggest justice can be replaced by forgiveness is STUPIDITY !_ Oh the irony of a law professor saying maybe the state shouldn't be in charge of pressing criminal charges on behalf of someone else...._ So...forgive the Crown Heights trend of blacks beating Orthodox Jews up, even though it has no rationale but for Jew hatred?

Testoserone and the amygdala of a Male brain is different it is a deadly machine just look at what we've done in history a blood bath. Not saying its bad we've needed violence to survive but it is not leaving_ Are you a Carpenter? You hit the Nail on the Head... & flush, in 1!_ Ivan I agree. It is seeing the truth, but it is also letting go of the right to get even. Forgiveness is seeing the debt and the pain caused and then canceling the debt. It‚Äôs not pretending that the debt never existed, but it‚Äôs also not holding onto your right to get even indefinitely. Forgiveness is seeing the truth, and then letting go._ If you can‚Äôt forget it and leave the past and still care if it‚Äôs a person they knew but want nothing to do with them still then your not wanting forgiveness and didn‚Äôt care to work on something you wanted to happen or succeed. Selfish is what it is. Cowardly as well. B. Too afraid of how you handled things because your inability to face your decisions  like an human adult . If you really felt forgiveness, you wouldn‚Äôt have grudges and didnt care to not cause negative tensions to  the other person so why ask forgiveness? Its cowardly and selfish.

While many people find it helpful to their own mental health to forgive, many others do not need to forgive someone to move on with their lives and they find the pressure on them to forgive to be harmful._ If we continue to cling to memories that bring pain and misery to others and to ourselves, we will not be able to \"live in the present\". It is mainly about ‚Äúallowing‚Äù everyone the chance for ‚Äúsecond chances‚Äù which are earned in the choices we make; in what we choose to forget and in what we forgive.

Liberal White Guilt \nreally does  destroy the capacity for rational thought..!!_ This talk shows how important traditional knowledge is for fighting climate change. As an anthropology student, I find it fascinating how the speaker's grandmother can predict weather better than a smartphone by just watching nature - the birds, winds, and plants.\n\nI love how she explains that indigenous people understand nature in a complete way. Their knowledge isn't just about the weather - it's about how people live, how men and women work together, and how communities survive hard times. The 3D mapping project she talks about is really interesting because it brings together old and new ways of understanding nature, while also giving women a stronger voice in their community.\n\nThe story about Lake Chad getting smaller (from 25,000 km¬≤ to 1,200 km¬≤) shows how environmental changes affect everything - how families live, where people move to, and how communities work together. This is exactly what we study in anthropology - how nature and human life are connected.\n\nThis talk shows us that we need both traditional wisdom and modern science to solve climate change. The speaker shows that when we respect and use both types of knowledge, we can find better solutions for our environmental problems.\n\nWhat do you think about using this kind of mapping project in other communities? Could this help bring together different types of knowledge in your area too?_ This is how white western imperialism prefers to deal with all its problems and cascade of catastrophes. What a pathetic show of resilience in front of an audience\nwhich itself is sustains the techno-industrial society, one that is killing the planet.

It still happens today when an African scientist discovers something or challenges long-standing western science from only a few hundred years ago. An example is Dr Bennett Omalu (Will Smith played him in the movie Concussion), a Nigerian doctor who discovered a disease affecting NFL players. He faced such discredit because he was African only to be proved right. This is a battle to restore African intelligence and the west have been doing all they can to suppress it, destroying our history and even claiming much of it as theirs. We even have advanced solutions in things such as mental health and many more. Africa has to remember herself and look to educate the young people on her discoveries for which they is a massive plethora of. As it stands we are still teaching our children that the world began from when they arrived and that the western man even discovered our land which is insane. The western man views science in disciplines and disparately whereas Afrikan science knows about the interrelatedness between and within everything. This is why the western man destroys the environment and nature for profit while we lived in harmony with it. We have to decolonise the education system, how, one way could be to teach about gravity but not about Isaac Newton himself. We also need to teach about our ancient systems and standardise some of them. This will empower the next generation to start to re-imagine the old discoveries and create new ones._ Amazing_ We should notice that as technology evolves, traditional knowledge is forgotten._ Is it too late to tell you that Covid-19 is solving climate change now?---LOL_ Or we just get super computers and simulate everything so we can destroy our planet more!_ very impressing speech_ Great talk!_ yes ma'am tell me what I need to do to save this planet._ Sounds kind of stupid ngl_ is she speaking pidgeon english cause i need a translation_ She has taken a very great initiative but the big corps would take the knowledge make ten fold profits not give credit !!! We need the indigenous people to sustain survive and prosper where they are.

Anyone can Geoff Lawton their way out of this mess._ It is great to know where all the local plants, medicinal herbs and water sources are for survival as you travel from place to place. It is also wonderful to know what to look for to predict when weather will soon change. What it doesn't tell you, is the why. Why are things changing ? Science tells you the why and how.  The knowledge she speaks of informs people about today and that is a great gift. The trends in plant growth can inform people about what to possibly expect next season, but it doesn't inform about the why. Why are these plants not growing well this season ? And when you can't answer the why, you move on to another place that has better fruits, better grains. You don't stay and try to fix the cause of why the plants aren't growing as well. Science can answer the why and provide a way to fix things so that next years harvest is better. As a nomadic tribe, you don't stay and farm the land. You move to where the crops are better. Staying and farming will help you understand the why._ I have no idea why But her accent is cutest one I ve ever heard_ Si alguien quiere ayudar al medio ambiente   deje de usar üöó  tome el üöå o ande en üö≤ no lave en m√°quina  lave a mano y demas electrodom√©sticos haga las cosas manualmente, recicle  si alguien ama el medio ambiente  tendr√° que renunciar alas comodidades  no veo a alguno_ She could talk for a year and I would listen to everything she had to teach.. amazing human, amazing people.

May I add that as long as greed is king of hearts, pollution and destruction are to be expected, so a philosophical shift is needed as well as a knowledge or technological one._ WE'LL DO THAT! üíöüí™üôè_ Save Our Planet_ Amazing speach! thank you for sharing<3_ Thank you for sharing your knowledge =]_ Is she single?_ https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbVvBzntopp9Q4LP_6nreqg_ Number ten_ Fantastic!_ Love ‚ù§Ô∏è_ Is that the same girl who wanted to start \"decolonisation\" by abolishing \"white\" science?_ I clicked on this just to see WTF she is wearing!_ Given that climate alarmists insist on scientific verification, it would be foolish to accept any of the speakers assertions without data to back them up. For example, it would be a fascinating exercise to get her Grandmother to predict the next years weather, then to check it as the year progresses. It would also be interesting to see, in a controlled experiment, whether her Grandmother and other people's grandmothers make the same predictions for the forthcoming year. Without such evidence her testimony is simply hearsay._ I wish I could have been there to hear her in person._ This was wonderful sharing. Thank you.

The knowledge of Indeginous Peoples is crucial in our understanding of the environment and how best to preserve it. I mean, they have been there and seen what's supposed to be there;so they will be the first to  know when something is wrong. Also, I like her call to integrate more Indeginous Customs into our lives.

Hugs from  Brazil_ one of the most important things we can learn from indigenous communities right now is sustainable farming \nscientific development must be permanently married with ecological concerns if we are ever going to survive on this planet - an ecologically destructive innovation is not an innovation \nwhat does it matter if we can feed a billion people with our factory farms if it leaves the land barren and unusable_ #RainbowNation2020_ Given that long term weather prediction is completely unreliable, with models that routinely fail to predict anything of value, it would not add to the accuracy of predictions to include untested assertions arising from indigenous knowledge. Such assertions need also to be held to a high standard of scrutiny before they should be given any credence._ too bad the American Government  doesn't listen to its Indigenous Peoples_ Lmao._ Dusty Prater , this is so true and well spoken !

Could you please explain how this observation is racist so i can avoid similar racist comments in future?_ @Aspartame69¬† well, you are implying 'we' are better than 'them' - presumably meaning the western world is superior in nature. Have you considered the part that post-colonisation may have to play in this??_ @zoeskinner2871¬† Wait now, are you suggesting that we are NOT better than them in terms of our agricultural industry? And no, i dont regard colonialism a large part of why their land is not efficiently managed. Do you labour under the impression that africa was a prospering functional place BEFORE colonisation?_ @Aspartame69¬† yes we are ECONOMICALLY better but not because we are fundamentally, better. That would be racist sorry to tell you. We are economically better because we've managed to get the 'global south' caught up in a trap of neo-colonialism that they can't escape (aswell as huge corruption in some of the governments). I haven't learnt Ancient history therefore I don't know what Africa was like before but what I do know is that its countries have huge potential in terms of resources, skills etc. It just happened that we got more powerful and began to exploit them as if their stuff was ours. Now, that still continues and has forced them to rely on ECONOMICALLY better places - Europe, the USA, China etc. It's nothing to do with ability_ @Aspartame69¬† in terms of agriculture, because we happen to be economically stronger (in large part due to colonisation) we can afford the big mass production systems and technologies.

Neither is particularly true, certainly not in their \"pop\" forms.  Most who cite the things, in either case, can't begin to explain it.  But hey, both are great to get funding and power, aren't they?_ @geek49203¬† leave politics out of science, with scientific matters listen to the scientists._ Biggest problem is people not willing to give up eating meat their every meal. If people consumed less meat factory farms could easily be replaced with animals being grown on pastures (a bit more humane), this would in turn drastically reduce CO2 production. It is possible to go 100% without meat consumption but people are suffering from malnutrition as it is because they don't know how to feed their bodies properly. It's a bit pointless to write about it here though as people who need to change the most are also least concerned with this stuff and most of them don't even believe in global warming, let alone watch videos on how to preserve the planet._ What was the point of this? What is the \"idea worth spreading\" here?\nBy all means, let's all work together to solve the problem of climate change. It affects all of us, and it affects poor people in developing countries much more. \n\nBut, come on, TED, seriously? Are we going to sit here and pretend that the indigenous people's knowledge of their environment is what's lacking in the scientific prediction of the weather? How? Because they observe the bugs and the birds? Well, we all did that once, and then we invented the scientific method and our predictions became immensely more accurate. Not perfect, but I'm willing to bet my house that this lovely woman's grandma will make wrong predictions much more than the scientists.\nAnd don't get me started on the argument that \"science is only 200 years old, but the indigenous people's knowledge is thousands of years old\" point, as if being older makes it better.\nThis young woman had half of her speech handed to her, because someone thought that hearing the plight of her tribe wasn't good enough, we should make it seem that they have something to offer to the field of meteorology and climate science. They don't. It's unnecessary to pretend that they do and, to be frank, quite patronizing to both us and them. We have moved far ahead from the point where anecdotal claims like the tale of the prediction of a single shower were considered reliable._ I am waiting for the TED to show us African shamans who will teach us how to live, so that the climate does not change.))_ Worthless_ Love her message. Everyone has to work together to if we want to save the earth_ That rain can be awfully wet stuff. I'm surprised the political correctness police haven't attacked the nomadic lifestyle. Alright, in all fairness, this young lady offers an informative talk that offers some good points. Thank you TED Talks for getting back on track with interesting and knowledgeable by real life experience people offering presentations._ The West gave the world Antibiotics  and that helped the massive population increase will they use contraception, no, as male heirs are too important. She said about the Migrants going into Europe.. We have to suck it up  4:40 send MONEY back to their home we the West have to adapt for these Migrants. Why do we have to do this Women are the answer if so why do the men leave to send money back to their Native Country. Rain just does not drop from Blue Sky why did she imply this? to suit the narrative (silly Western Scientists). If the Indigenous knowledge is so brilliant why did they not invent so much from the 1700's on why oh why does she think that we only have 10 years?

And when we can't trust the weatherman we call each other and discuss nature._ This woman is from a part of Africa (Chad) where atrocious terrorist attacks and brutal war crimes have been committed between Muslims and Christians over grazing lands. The West pretty much is in the dark about this and if you bring it up you'll be called a racist. Even her tribe, the Mbororo, have greatly suffered at the hands of bandits with no political or religious affliation. I bet she's glad to be the heck out of there since young women are routinely kidnapped for ransom money._ Covid 19 already resolved climat problems üòâ_ The question presented at 12:00 tho.... There‚Äôs simply no excuse. ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt we?‚Äù coughcolonizationcough_ I'd prefer to hear Neil DeGrasse Tyson teaching me on how big his black hole is on a TED's stage better than a woman from the middle of nowhere, talking about how a modern science doing it wrong, and her pigmey tribe is doing it right with her grandma app, sorry. We don't need to fight a climate change. We need to fight tribesmen telling us how bad our science  is._ I like her fashion_ she look like a Dalek ngl_ TED and other progressives have become anti-science.  It‚Äôs what happens when the pathogen that is politically correctness infects the mind.  Unfortunately that pathogen is spreading throughout modern society._ Lmao._ It's called capitalism...)))_ Lol. Exactly_ I wanted to answer this comment in the most polite and educational way possible but I don't even know where to start... Western societies gave the world antibiotics, along with all the harmful industry that's wrecking people's health and destroying the environment. I think scientific methodology has lead to great advances but any scientist with half a brain can also tell you the only way to bring about all the positive changes we can achieve through research is to be aware that we do not know everything and should keep an open mind. Yeah she got some factoids wrong... anyone can Google a bunch of random facts; what's more difficult is to be able to see the big picture like this woman was. She was talking about combining different branches of knowledge, in order to develop a more detailed insight of the world around us and thus better cope with the challenges we face. This is nothing new in science! This merging of different fields is how we developed great multidisciplinary sciences like Biomedical Sciences and Neuroscience. It could be really advantageous to do this with traditional knowledge as well, we should explore this potential more. Also, just on a side note, female scientist migrants such as myself would truly appreciate some thought put into this sort of remarks before blurting out intolerant comments that literally bring nothing good to anyone. Not very productive to pile on all the bad stuff already happening in the world._ @950galesia7¬† The world was NOT a paradise before the west developed. What we see in the third world now, is pretty much how they lived before the west rose, if not much worse in many cases. Tribal and territorial conflict is the reality of primitive life and the west is the best hope to change that._ ugly dress, meh person, delusional message not rooted in reality_ @kekzealot3568¬† Hello KekZealot - what is a meh person? I do not know that term._ Thx for clarification_ The ignorance in the statement is outstanding.  Scientific conclusions are made when observations are made that are verifiable and repeatable.  The best thing about science, is that future science can always prove old science wrong.  There is no ego in science.  Unlike the silly pseudoscience of knowledge that came from days when people thought the earth was flat.  Worshipping indigenous people and hating western society doesn‚Äôt make you a good person._ @Lorenzo1972.¬† I'll give you another. Gravity was thought to be constant. Now, science has proven themselves wrong again. The speed of light, has been proven to be the fastest thing. One day, science will be proven wrong again. Science is always right until it's not anymore. It is purely hypothetical._ Indeed beyond stupidity._ Thats sounds verry cool and interesting_ Exactly!!

Reason and rationality is knowledge, learn Ayn Rand before these creeps sacrifice you to them._ \"Solve\" or \"Suffer\"?  There's no solution that Nature won't take care of itself.  Human hubris and fear of death cannot be overcome.  We'll \"save everyone\" while allowing too many people harm us all.

Reason is not knowledge it is your faculty to decide or process on data, information arises out of it, can be said a first processed knowledge, rationality is quality of person who is rational in his/her approach, being too much rational is not good ,it should be supported by empirical evidences if not all but certain cases to held its validity.\nLearn from by observing and conclude by processing rationally, knowledge in simplest term is knowing which is still contested very much.\nUnlearn everything you know before you start calling yourself learned being, because it won't be needed once you are one._ Socialism and Communism do not value the individual. The individual is subservient to the state in such regimes. There is no room for individualism in socialist systems, as they rely on submission to policies determined by the party, and reinforced by making people reliant on welfare. Just look at China and North Korea._ PsychoSocialCreation yes!_ So good!_ I am encouraged by prices as low as 3 trillion (each) to reforest the Sahara/Gobi/Australia (including energy cheap desalination and Solar shade (australia uses) for saplings)), likely to be restructuring rain systems._ IKR I want to be like her_ This is the dumbest comment I‚Äôve ever seen in my life_ You need to think critically about the knowledge that these people have she may be talking about the weather now but you have to look at other things such as medicine these people will know medicines that will be effective where new chemical made medications won‚Äôt and looking at this the amount of runoff and pollution caused by the major pharmaceutical companies using this knowledge can allow for alternatives and as a person on many medications and as a biologist who‚Äôs dissertation is on heavy metal tolerance in plants ( this metal can come from pollutant run off mines and from rain like how acid rain occurs) we have used in this local knowledge which aided in the experimental design allowing for determination of new growth sites natural sites and older or ancient sites. This knowledge is invaluable and although not used for climate change is allowing us to better understand how plants across the developed and developing world will adapt. The knowledge she is also talking about is more intrinsic to their way of life and rainfall changes are becoming harder to predict her people don‚Äôt use the same method so can predict changes that science won‚Äôt catch. At the university I attend the ocean sciences school bring in these old timer sailors who aided their design of of some of their equipment but also to impart their knowledge to the young scientists on reading and understanding the environment in a way without fancy equipment or even binoculars, this actually has also lead to a study on certain animal behaviour within the ocean and their reactions to their environment. So yes she may not have said this is what we did and how our knowledge helped with climate change but you need to look at the wider implications and context saying that she didn‚Äôt make the point isn‚Äôt what talks like this are for they are to inspire thought and cooperation cons change not to make literal statements._ @firstladyshine¬† point to me to where she mentioned when it's helped solve climate change_ shut up and burn dung_ @stoirmdraodih6810¬† no one is reading your essay_ @miguelsuarez-solis5027¬† You just sat here and listened to a 13 minute video hopefully and their comment is an essay?

Gurl....GURL!!! No one wants to read that!_ @firstladyshine¬† Ever!?_ I don't think she meant to solve climate change on stage on a TED talk... I think she wanted to stress the potential that lies in the combination of different bodies of knowledge. Plus, she did describe that the nature of her community's lifestyle allows them to live in harmony with their ecosystem. I think the takeaway from this talk is that there are aspects of indigenous knowledge that we could try to integrate in our Western societies so to disrupt the Earth's ecosystem the least amount possible. The point of these TED talks is to share ideas that have potential._ Stoirm Draodih It is condescending to modern western society, and to her, to believe anything of value was stated.  She concludes by stating we have 10 years remaining to take action - is that what her grandmother told her?  Lol.  No...politicians and progressive ideologues told her this.  I bet no one here could tell me how much scientists believe our oceans will rise over the next 100 years without looking it up.  Yet you fall for the climate hysteria without any knowledge - just like this naive woman did.  Thanks again for nothing, TED._ @950galesia7¬† This reminds me of that college conference where a bunch of black students berated a white kid for trying to bring science into the debate.

I think Noeline's question \"what would you do if you had all the money in the world\" is a bit too simplistic and will not work 100% of the time. Some people would just retire and live a boring life if they had all the money in the world. Her view that paper qualifications do not define one is pretty spot on though.

His works encourage the human race to question our ways and be more mindful of our choices. My favourite quote from 'An ode to living on Earth', \"We have the wildest of opportunities to hit the reset button.\" In my opinion we have to change for the better good (of everyone) learn from our mistakes and move forward for every living thing to \"Share the Planet\" in harmony.

There's been too much regression in the name of politics + business, but you won't know. Because over a grandeur scale, nothing matters YET over a personal scale, everything matters (even as little as the amount of sugar we put in tea, or soda in whiskey or the intensity/authenticity of our smiles or the firmness/tone of our voices or the depths of our longings or the evil in our eyes & more).

If you would think for a minute,  what they did is an extremyl expensive lidar with a bit of software to visualise reflections_ @LotnyLotnik¬† Tesla is already using road surface for scanning for cars ahead of it - it bounces the radar signal underneath a car that's directly in front of it to see one car further._ ya i thought abt this, what if its raining? fog? but I'm not worried because they will find a solution_ You could vary the frequencies produced by each car's laser, and then filter at the receiver so it only receives its frequency of light_ @Th35ix¬† Don't you need a protocol for them to negotiate what frequency to use? And if so, can't you use that frequency to exchange position information instead?_ @Theraot¬† Yeh for sure, im not going to pretend i know what that protocol might look like though.\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by the position? That would a different technology if you're directly communicating position between cars, no? Although, jt definitely can be done. with an array of antenna you can determine the direction that the signal is coming from (very cool stuff!)_ Lugubriously¬† i know! ! This stuff is amazing!_ ‚Äã¬†@Th35ix¬† Yes, what I suggest would be different technology. I'm thinking economy here.\n\nExchanging position information between cars, can probably can piggyback on existing technologies, such as Wi-Fi positioning system. Or on near future 6G networks (I read positioning with 6G network signals would have centimetre accuracy).\n\nWell, LiDar would have the advantage of recognizing moving objects that are not in the network.\n\nWell, writing this, I came up with something better: Put nodes on intersections. If we are going to use LiDar to get incoming traffic across intersection, you might instead put a LiDar system on a pole (perhaps repurpose semaphores). Then the pole would relay information to cars over a different protocol. Now, cars don't need to negotiate. And making LiDar cheaper and smaller is less of a problem.\n\nAlright, you might still have some benefit of a portable LiDar off road. Sure, you can put LiDars on cars for that. The folks who stay on the city roads probably can do without purchasing those._ Alfonso J. Ramos Everybody, it would be much more easier to connect with 5G or next G every single car to get their gps position, put it in cloud and communicate between them each second to know their exact position without ‚Äúseeing‚Äù that exact position. This thing with corners might be used in different domains. But not with cars_ @mr.coco19¬† If it is going to be GPS based, I'd rather see a mesh network solution, and that can be Wi-Fi. Going all the way to a remote data-center just to come back to next car is a waste of resources, an overhead in time, and single point of failure.\n\nAbout 6G, for what I have seen so far, it will be multiplexed spatially with directional antenas, and the resolution would probably be better than GPS, so getting positioning information directly from the network towers would be better.\n\nThere are, of course, still concerns with 6G, I don't know how that will go.\n\nAddendum: Oh, yes, I'm only arguing the use on cars. Looking around obstacles would be great in other situations, including the space rover, and assistance in disaster situations._ make 10 images per second, each lating one nanosecond in the making and the probability o say two of them interesecting is about one in 100 million\nor once every 10 million seconds or every 3000 hours\nadd a line that lets it take two images and compare or check if the image makes sense or is messed up somehow and retake if needed and that error rae becomes  acceptable_ At that point, the cars will be communicating with eachother long before they can see eachothers laser._ You are 9 years late in existence of Trillion fps.

These consumer sensors are used to work out how long it takes for pulses of laser light to directly reach the camera, and from this to calculate where objects are in 3d space. In order to view around corners, I guess there would need to be a lot more computing power, plus a scanned laser rather than flood illumination used by consumer systems.

If you could do a large study, I would wager the presence of a Y chromosome overwhelmingly correlates with male anatomy and testosterone levels. Now could there be genetic abnormalities or exceptions like the SINGLE example she provided? It's certainly possible. But these intersex situations are rare. Amongst those, conditions of intersexuality where the reproductive organs are completely ambiguous are even more rare (some sources say as low as 1 in 4500 people.) Assuming the genetic test was perfect and not a false positive, it sounded like even the woman athlete in her story had typical female anatomy and estrogen levels. I seriously doubt that many \"transgender\" people even fit into the intersex category, let alone the ambiguous genitalia subcategory. The \"transitioning\" surgeries that many gender dysphoric people get these days more often than not remove clearly male or female reproductive organs.

XYY syndrome applies to males who have an extra Y chromosome. In fact, guys with XYY syndrome are generally taller and more muscular on average. There are zero females with the xyy grouping, and her chart states otherwise.

I'm not at biologist, but it would make sense to me if it turned out that female development were somehow a default, having nothing to do with these chromosomes, and only the Y chromosome would be needed to start male development instead. Like if female were the template and male is just built on top of that. It seems like the most efficient system and it also would explain why men have nipples._ It definitely would have helped for her to talk more about the actual genetics of it. The SRY gene on the Y chromosome determines whether someone's male or not. One x-chromosome in just about everyone has suppressed genes.

There is something called x-inactivation so females will act as if they only have 1 copy of X no matter if they have 2 or even more copies of the X chromosome. Maleness comes from the SRY gene. So really anything that doesn't have the SRY gene would most likely be considered female phenotype (looking like a woman). The reason some women have testes is usually because of another mutation causing androgen insensitivity. They are usually X/Y genotype, but due to a mutation in the AR (androgen receptor) gene they may present as female or mostly female and identify as a woman. https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/androgen-insensitivity-syndrome#genes Look under the \"causes\" tab if you want to learn more.\n\n\n She wasn't just pointless in her talk. She actually spread mis-information. Not explicit lies mind you, but the whole bit about making a big deal about how none of the researchers seemed to care about \"super females\" was because it would be silly. X-inactivation would take care of that. She didn't lie about it, but presented it as if the researchers were just sexist as opposed to more informed than her. It was an obvious question for scientist to look at once they discovered XYY males. They were VERY premature with their findings, but really the main problem was that the media sensationalized the study. Even upon discovering that one of the main people in the study was actually just XY, the media still ran with the narrative (and they continued to use him as an example) rather than questioning the whole thing because that is what the media does.

For example, it is true that there are people who have different combination of x and y chromosomes from the xx and xy but they are individuals with chromosomic syndromes, like Turner's syndrome or the Klinefelter's one, involving symptoms like mixed secondary sexual traits, mental retardation and infertility. Moreover, these cases are not common as it seems from this ted talk. This is just one of the wrong things here, my point is that this woman wants to talk about gender involving biological concepts in an incorrect, incomplete and confused way._ @atreyu119¬† Where is the timestamp where she says \"thousands of XXY prisoners\"?_ One point being \"don't look here for credibility or info\"?_ @agrifoni95¬† Why is their prevalence particularly important? It seems to me that the existence of even one person who falls outside the model disproves the model.\nYou certainly wouldn't go \"Well, our model of gravity doesn't account for how Pluto acts, but that's just one planet, an outlier, so it's still true and something's just wrong with Pluto\".\n\nThe model we are usually taught, that XY = female and XX = male is, categorically and inescapably, incorrect. It's not true. There are people for whom this is reversed, and there are people who have more of either one.\nPeople with additional chromosomes are still human. If there are but two sexes, they are either female or male, and the model is incorrect. If there are more than two sexes, the model remains incorrect in not accounting for the additional sexes. \nWhen the data contradicts a model, the only coherent response is to alter the model, not simply dismiss the contradictory data as \"outliers\", as though that in itself doesn't render the model incorrect for not accounting for the \"outliers\"._ ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£   triggered üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ_ this all sounds a little silly. the eggs women produce are always eggs. the sperm men produce aren't mostly y, they're 50:50 x or y. so baring a male child isn't the responsibility of a man.\ni'm not sure what you're on about with x chromosomes or y chromosomes being stronger. and that isn't what causes you to have male or female babies.\noh well_ you don't even know what a god of the gaps argument is._ @joannot6706¬† Yeah, they learned the phrase, figured out that it can be used to dismiss facts and just ran with it._ How is this a god of the gaps argument?_ Triggered hahah_ Rafay Cheema International Classification of Diseases_ literally says November 2019 right at the beginning of the video_ yipyipitsme123 TED doesn't care about social distancing.

The problem is when we incorrectly atribute some information to the pattorn, like asuming your mom rings the bell because you saw her doing it ones eventoo your dad rings it just as often. Or not being able to see the norm of the pattorn isn't always the rule, like when the bell is accitentally rang and you still think dinner is ready.\nNow take this situation. You see someone with a t-shirt with a game logo on it, the person is probably a gamer and you can get in a coversation with the person about the topic. But because the person wheres the shirt doesn't mean the person likes the game, but just the look (the norm of the pattorn isn't always the rule). Or because the person is a gamer doesn't mean she's male (incorrectly atribute some information to the pattorn).\nIn short what I'm trying to say is using labels is a effective way to engage the world, but inperfect because humans are inperfect.\nsorry for bad grammer and the wall of text_ @sine8811¬† If males and females know who they are why can't everyone else?_ Sean Davis¬† triggered hahahahha_ There wasn't that much about labels and identity, just the fact that XY doesn't equal male and XX doesn't equal female, which is backed up by science.

So that really isn't an issue.\nEven if that wasn't the case. This is nothing new. Science communicators have always been the main people who communicate science to the public. Be it on radio, television, podcasts whatever. Even in school science teachers are basically communicators who may not have a background in research or applied science. If you understand the subject you're set. Scientists may not have the time or the skills to communicate effectively._ @JustMe-ce9yo¬† The point wasn't to tell everyone exactly how these chromosomes work, it was to debunk some common myths, including the one that XX definitely means female amd XY definitely means male. The subject is simplified but that's her job as a science reporter; taking science that may be hard to understand and simplify it for a more general public. The fact that she left out a few things, like that X chromosomes are bigger than Y chromosomes (which I think is common knowledge anyways but that's not the point) doesn't invalidate the other things she said. This is a debunking video about the history of the X and Y chromosomes. Not a break-down of the X and Y chromosomes and their functions._ XORRE lol thank you_ Nazli Aydin she is literally wrong about some of the things she presents. she is directly contradicting the currently accepted literature on more than one occasion in this talk. That‚Äôs why I have a problem with her presenting, and that‚Äôs why I think we should leave these types of discussions to SCIENTISTS._ @rybohm9829¬† what is she wrong about, specifically?_ Thomas Warner 5:38. she made a chart claiming that the ‚ÄòXYY‚Äô chromosome group can belong to both male AND female phenotypes. This is wrong. XYY syndrome applies to males who have an extra Y chromosome. In fact, guys with XYY syndrome are generally taller and more muscular on average. There are zero females with the xyy grouping, and her chart states otherwise.

This is embarrassing. You can even see the disappointment in the faces in the audience._ As a  science fan, she Made pretty solid points._ This is a good talk. I almost stopped watching after reading the comment section, but I‚Äôm glad  I finish watching this._ It's the first time I hear X being called the female chromosome. This looks like a typical case of SJW self-triggering over some fantasy of prejudice..._ Is this appropriate for a ages 7to13??_ The thing i was afraid of has come ... Sjw's now are coming at science they will do everything at they're power to make it politicaly correct and egalitarian and non offensive_ It is amazing the particular TED Talks I've become willing to listen to (regardless how unnecessary or uninteresting) while being in home \"safe distancing\" isolation._ Teddy Talks get more ridiculous every day._ I call bullshit that her body couldn't \"Use the testosterone\" any human body can use testosterone including male, female, or anything in between._ Corona be like :- bruh_ It was awesome....I am a student of Zoology myself yet I didn't knew about all of these facts.... Knowledge is Awesome_ So the most important part of chomosomes are their labels. No suspire there. I wish i could make a career out of talking bollocks.\n\n\nLets just ignore the fact that the convention for the x/y chromosome highlights the most useful and interesting difference between males and females, because it highlights what is an uncomfortable truth for some, that there is a difference between males and females._ I see so many transphobic comments in this section it‚Äôs actually disgusting. It‚Äôs 2020, get over yourselves..._ thank you._ Keduax_ Of course doctors can tell you things about yourself that you wouldn‚Äôt know! ‚ÄúMs. Smith, you have pancreatic cancer.‚Äù ‚ÄúMr Williams, you have cirrhosis.‚Äù What a silly argument to make! The rest of the talk is interesting._ ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è_ Ted Talks have become a joke._ He makes alot of good points.lol.adams apple always gives these degenerates away_ i guessed 1%_ you mean \"off by 1%\" ?_ @joannot6706¬† 4 is 20% less than 5._ (5 % - 4 %) / 4 % = 0.25\n\nYou were off by 25 %._ Sexvibos_ @flensdude¬† by that reasoning, guessing 0% or 8%, are both 100% wrong?_ @you2tooyou2too¬† \nGuessing any number other than 4 % is 100 % wrong ._ Fact dont care about your feelings, ü§£ü§£ü§£_ \"as a science fan\" \nEnough said_ Yes, but are science fans ALSO Truth fans?\n\nThat's the question of the hour..._ Like??_ It seems every TED talk about things that could be construed as social issues get a bunch of dislikes and condescending comments, regardless of how good or bad the talk was. Kinda sucks_ XORRE¬† wow....deflect much?_ I totally agree! After seeing the comments I was struggling during the entirety of the talk to see what they were talking about. Because In the end I did not derive half of what these people are commenting. \n\nThat this was an LGBT talk, and also that she‚Äôs trying to ‚Äúdestroy‚Äù cultural boundaries between the genders. I‚Äôm starting to wonder if we all watch the same thing. Or if some of these people have any level of comprehension. It‚Äôs really mind blowing how people make their own conclusion, and miss 99.9% of the conversation._ Exactly. X chromosome is just the default. It is the SRY gene on the Y chromosome that makes embryos develop as a male. Just one gene determines it unless there are other problems. Like with the athlete who had a problem with her AR gene. Even though she developed testes and was producing male hormones; the body wasn't picking it up so she defaulted to female presenting, but still had testes due to presense of the SRY gene._ Triggered  hahaahna_ Yes_ It wont hurt them but would a kid give a damn about the info?_ Brett idk maybe if their into biology_ @jimmylogan1866¬† it's just science, they aren't pushing any ideas about gender or sexuality onto them and even if they were, so what?_ Yes, nothing explicit if that's what you're asking._ üòÇ what you don't realize is what you are calling SJWs are biologists and they've known these things for a long time. Objective biological reality has nothing to do with your non scientific opinions. Study biology past the basic overview_ Lol yep!! Not everyone who does a ted talk is credible. Just look at Elizabeth Holmes lol_ Yes! It was, like i dont understand why people in the comments are hating her so much. This video literally just told us that, having XX wont make you a female and XY wont make you a male,  Its something way more deeper than that. Simple video.  But people are just going nuts._ Yes, good to see people here who aren't freaking out... Everything that slightly challenge the common sense of what \"things are and should be\" will be highly criticized... Great talk_ XORRE¬† They did explain how... only 4% of the 23rd chromosome actually relates to sexual coding, and with so much genetic variety in the world, you can't classify people according to that chromosome. This is information we've learned over the last 60 years._ @Jack-nx1si¬† \"you can't classify people according to that chromosome\"\n\nClassify in what context? Medicine?_ @HiAdrian¬† medically you can say xx means girl xy means boy it's too general and inaccurate_ XORRE¬† we are not often correct. As she explained in the video. most people are never tested for the chromosomal makeup.. have you? We often make assumptions and assumptions that we are correct_ Whew, glad I'm not alone thinking along this line. Thanks for commenting._ Facts dont care about your feelings hahahahah_ when will you open that biology book and see that xx ad xy is the norm and the rest of combinations are genetic diseases?_ @croitorustefan5264¬† XXY and XYY aswell as androgen insensitivety syndrome and many other combinations and variations are in many cases nondetectable unless youre checked by a doctor. I am willing to bet my own Y that you haven't opened a biology book since 9th grade either, because it certainly sounds like it.\n\nBesides, \"the norm\" is such a weird excuse. These people exist. That's it. Intersex people or people with rare chromosomal connections sure aren't common, but neither are redheads. Doesn't mean you get to act like they don't exist or say they abnormal. Stop arguing from your sad feelings and read an actual paper on the topic._ @croitorustefan5264¬† Scientists believe these genetic errors are the cause of us being able to breathe, walk on land and think for ourselves over the course of millions of years. The current status quo means nothing in that regard and, to be frank, seems to be rather outdated already. I mean, my biology books only mentioned the 'super's briefly, I had no idea about the other ones. Clearly this field is still deepening and broading, so let's try to keep an open, scientific mind about new information that builds on what we already know, shall we?_ @stt4676¬† XXY is a male only mutation because men who have Klinefelters can father children but never get pregnant. The more you know. Stop trying to use it to to justify the fact that we have two sexes. Otherwise we'd be able to reproduce multiple different types and ways._ It's so sad to see that a 9th grader accepts biology the way it is and you can't see it, isn't it?_ Fanel 42069 no, seeing your ignorance is sad._ XORRE¬† ah yes a man of culture_ @stt4676¬† oh my god God bruh....\n\nYou sound more typical right now than a PSA about Marijuana in the 70's....\n\nGet some new material!!!_ Exactly! They're getting so upset haha_ XORRE¬† I dunno, sounds more like you are having a hard time coping with the facts in this video_ Well, as we just discussed, there exist things outside the norm. Being stubborn and closeminded to name a few. As well as sadists; people that recieve pleasure from causing or watching people in pain or stuggle. We live in a very diverse world indeed._ @croitorustefan5264¬† No. That's not how it works. You've never taken a biology course. If you had, you'd know that._ @bradyrewell6130¬† if a biology course teaches you that there are more than 2 normal and natural genders I can't name it biology course_ @bradyrewell6130¬† Are you aware of the fact, that 99.9% of all people are either male (XY, producing sperm cells) or female (XX, producing egg cells)? 0.1% have DSDs (DISORDERS of sexual development). These intersex people are not a third gender since they produce either sperm cells or egg cells(or they are sterile)._ \"Hey man, you got something in your teeth\"_ So... why are you here?_ @kinsmed¬† because he's a joke_ Let me guess, that's not the kind of skepticism and learning you appreciate_ Wholeheartedly agree. People need to know that TED talks are biased and dangerous._ Is this a readout from Wikipedia ?_ Logic goes like this, if, else. There is no maybe, kind of, or I feel like statement. That's how logic works._ When's TED finally gonna rise to the challenge and talk_ ted talks alot.._ A good story._ Stop reading at \"science writer\". Journalism is not a scientist._ There are only two genders male and female nothing else XX chromosome an XY chromosome._ What genders did Trump pay this month? Male and Female.

But maybe you hoped talking about quantum mechanics would magically make you right_ @rybohm9829¬† stop play pretending that star trek is real, kid_ Matthew Morton oh god, i‚Äôm worried about us americans. the ignorance is everywhere... look up ‚Äúelectron superposition‚Äù before embarrassing yourself further. this is real physics, not star trek üòÇ. Just because something might be too hard for you to comprehend doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not real science._ you tou i‚Äôm talking about probabilistic logic, the link you sent me was unrelated to my comment but i see what you‚Äôre trying to say. fuzzy logic is far different._ 1st Quantum physics destroys your claim. \nAnd 2nd this talk isn't about logic it's about a subject we don't fully understand and is still being studied.\nyour comment is garbage liked by mistaken people._ Lmao, you're trying to say this is a binary model, and equate that to logic?? It is objectively, definitely not. Sorry but this is one of the most ignorant things I've seen._ @revisionfour, bovine rear end product. First, the 'else' depends on many 'ifs', not just one. Second, biology has very little to do with logic. If you find that scary, go and study something more straightforward._ You, a manchild: There's ONLY TWO THING! ONLY TWO!\nReality: There's at least like 16, actua-\nYou: NO. ONLY TWO! ONLY TWO THING! LOGIC!_ Hakkapeele this TED Talk displays some objectively false information. do some research. keep the emotion out of it and stick to the science. this speaker is not a scientist._ @rybohm9829¬† What information is that?_ we want TED's talk_ So which one is it, gonna or rose?_ @Adrian, and what chromosome does he or she have?_ Big boss hiding in the back sending out his men only_ @alionguy¬† ƒühhh_ @justsomeguywitharedeyes3472¬† Did you just assume TED's gender??! ü§£_ Nowhere does it say she‚Äôs a scientist though?_ nils. Yes but calling yourself ‚ÄúScience writer‚Äù implies something to the ill-informed other than journalism._ @nilsang924¬† its misleading_ Sir Gawain journalism is ill-informed all the time._ @seasong7655¬† nah....sometimes you should_ Triggered hahahaha_ But \"science writer\" doesn't mean scientist. It means you write about science._ @kaykay1570¬† Ever heard stay woke go broke? Just wait. Even Disney now having problem with their wokeness._ @nilsang924¬† She gives talk about a topic about science._ Stop watching ben Shapiro  haha_ shaka mata _ African pride¬†  Amazing. its really fascinating.  Thanks.\nThe only thing people will see in that  informative comment is \"junk DNA\".  Just watch  them all flip their lid.  ü§£\nHave a nice day. üòÅ_ This statement is true only about the human norm._ dude you can't just ignore the science.

How can you be this wrong when she corrects you like 6 minutes into the talk?_ It would not be the first time science finds out the issue runs deeper that origionally thought. I'm glad there's research being done into it and I can't wait to see what they find out over the next 50 years. I bet we'll looknback at this thread and go: Hah we were so ignorant back then. How did we not see the simple truth back then?_ @bubba lee where are those cultures now?_ airwaves in lila \nThe probability is way less than that_ Except for the other, like, 12 combinations that are possible lol_ @ahmadyasser7569¬† They died just like every culture will eventually. The fact that they don't exist anymore or are reduced to very small numbers doesn't prove anything, and it doesn't have anything to do with the way gender was viewed in that culture. All cultures will die or change to a point where they can't be linked to its previous form, it just takes time._ @artema.¬† I'm not saying it died what I'm saying is similar to evolution, only the most logical ideology lives just like the idea that there are two genders. And I'm sure those tribes didn't specifically divide themselves among 5 genders. But if you think so, could you explain the five genders to me please?_ @artema.¬† Are you aware of the fact, that 99.9% of all people are either male (XY, producing sperm cells) or female (XX, producing egg cells)? 0.1% have DSDs (DISORDERS of sexual development). These intersex people are not a third gender since they produce either sperm cells or egg cells(or they are sterile)._ but what she is saying is that male and female chromosomes are not what you think they are._ Yikes comment._ XORRE¬† Cringe my dude.

Using this model in developed countries, a la E. Warren, et al., for educational loans, however, just adds to the glut of governmental and NGO worker bees without adding any productivity to the economy. Recognizing the reality of \"You get what you provide incentives for\", we should be creating educational loans designed to promote STEM, Healthcare, and not Humanities programs into the marketplace. Nothing against the Humanities as they were, but they have careened into the \"Studies\" wasteland and are a part of the anti-business, anti-reality brigade on most campuses.

I don't see a problem with community service as a means to pay off debt given by the community. It has a compounding effect and if it means people have access to actionable credit and are then able to put people to work, its a work force multiplier._ Rather than putting them in prison due to inability to pay, you put them to work so that they could pay the loan.\nOf course people like you would disagree. Such method decrease the effectiveness of capitalism. And with such method, the country itself could make money and thus evade the fate of being financially exploited by western money.\n\n\nThat being said, the method explained wont be free of problem and exploitation._ @mcphinney6318¬† Some...folks think that Western style economy n capitalism (and democracy) could be applied everywhere in the world. And by applying it everyone would prosper. They forgot that their economic system work because their economic situation support it while the situation in third world countries could hardly support such high level of consumerism of the West._ @eleethtahgra7182¬† „Öî_ @eleethtahgra7182¬† actually, both forms are sort of evil to me. I don't agree with our false dichotomy of capitalism( what we call democracy) which is based off the have and the have hots. The problem with this though is because we have based our system off of this for so long, it is impossible for anything better than capitalism to be effective. Sure this new system could be effective for some time but, eventually, just like capitalism and uncle Sam, corruption will ensue. That is to say  we would be taking a huge step backwards.\n\n I also do not agree with this new method coming about. What most fail to realize is that this is no longer and ideology. Sure it's just a Ted talk right now but this was already being implemented for future plans back in 2012. What I mean is, it was always going to happen eventually and part of this new buzz term/movement of do-gooders called socialist Democrats."

But I felt in a future of The Jetsons or Cyberpunk 2077. Let's say you expected more than a single foot on the ground. When I think about the future, I believe in a life more accessible to everyone, but frankly, it seems irrelevant to talk about what I will do when I go to the bathroom.\n\nI ended the whole Ted waiting for the actual point of interest._ What if  after we die , der is a black box in us .\nWhich our family can get üôãüôã_ Some people want to fall between the cracks._ im so proud of how far Stephanie from lazy town has come üíñü•∞üëåü•¥_ Man, right?

Would that change how you live your life, knowing your loved ones would see all of your life?\n\nThis could be brilliant as a way to think about the benefits of dishonesty, & how the black box of your life being seen could act as a sort of thought & action control, for fear of what people would think later on. People often say this is the case of when they were religious, that they feared what their god would see of their secret thoughts & actions. \nYou've essentially created a thought experiment where you've replaced the idea of a god with the known potential of your family seeing your whole life after death.\n\nGenuinely this one idea is so good, you could create so much with this as a basis.\nI hope you do. I would myself but I don't want to take your idea, so I really hope you use this & go with it as a writing prompt.\nI hope you don't mind if I use it as a writing prompt myself, just for me._ Sometimes I think we already died...

So often these people are abused as children, by people who were abused themselves. This causes mental illness and personality disorders. They're literally a broken mirror trying to be a real person again, even if only a fictional one, as a coping mechanism. Unfortunately, it's a continuous chain, a \"meta-reproductive cycle\", which means this person may also be a threat to children. Statistics show they're already a threat to themselves. There's no 'pride' in being a broken person, they need help._ Is that Emo Phillips?_ Parts of imagination is going to come true. \nThe day will come true.

Something that's kind of obvious, considering that you're not reviewing research papers, but writing fiction, something that automatically involves imagination/creativity.\n\nEverything else just seems to be a mindfest about 'oh wow, what if the future was like this or this?!' which - again - I'm certain most everyone already thinks about and likely is the major draw for writing science fiction by default.\nAll the elements of a stereotypical ted-talk is there: random jokes, wise-sounding one liners, quotes, 'relatable' remarks, but little-to-no value in terms of information in my opinion._ Some of these TED Talks sound like ideas you'd come up with when you're really stoned but instead of dismissing it, an expert or professional devotes their lives trying to legitimize it._ I love her message and for everyone to focus on her looks is ridiculous. She's obviously a very creative person and I think she's beautiful._ I'm terribly sorry, I didn't even start watching the talk, but I already continued the title in my mind:\n\"Go ahead, dream about the future, I dare you!\"\n\n(Edit) Ok, I wasn't that far off!.. She acknowledges that the future may just turn out to be too weird to seem believable today.\nWhat I disagree with is that future totally is an extension of the present. That's not a fallacy, that's a definition. But the farther the extension, the less accurate predictions get, which is why people can easily get the wrong idea. Because extremely improbable but impactful things might just end up happening, and the farther the extension, the more the chances that some of those will occur and toss most prior predictions out the window. Take the current pandemic for instance..._ It total should be open your big eyes and look around!_ Wow, 80% of comments are just  people being transphobic.  I am kinda disappointed with TED‚Äôs audience_ The two comments above prove my point: Some people don't have the ability to see past their own hatred and actually listen. Its sad._ Because usually people who hate the way trans women look and who base their critique off of appearance are transphobic jerks who are \"hateful.\" But since i'm responding back, you'll probably dismiss that and become contrarian. \"Its just that its 'weird,' not that shes trans.\" Whatever dude._ Guilty._ Your ego is way too big when you think having to give someone respect despite your personal opinion is outrageous. \"Why should I have to ignore wah wah\" wah get over yourself you sound like a little boy_ You know that this video isn‚Äôt about this human‚Äôs personal life that is none of your business. It‚Äôs hilarious that you admit you didn‚Äôt even watch the video. Maybe you should listen for a few minutes and actually learn something. Isn‚Äôt that so crazy? To learn!_ @Jack-nx1si¬† I would love to show respect but unfortunately I don't respect these kind of things or actions. I guess I have the liberty to do this but thank you for sharing your opinion (not that I care about it or something)._ @Backtothezack¬† Well, it's crazy that you just assumed that I still didn't watch the video and didn't think that I wrote the comment while watching the first few minutes. Isn't that crazy? To jump into conclusions!_ Ryan dissipates and no one's bothered_ Did you mention this song because of the pink hair?  Here's the song on YouTube.  https://youtu.be/ZD71JeX4Vk0_ RNorthex maybe it was told to distract the audience, like a breath of fresh air from listening to heavier ted talks let‚Äôs say..._ We can savely assume this also takes in copious amounts of psycho-active substances._ @sebastiaandewit159¬†safely._ Happy 4/20_ They probably are ü§©_ HER_ That‚Äôs clearly NOT a woman.

(Bill gates even did a ted talk on it even talked about the world economy taking a 3 trillion dollar hit)_ Mac Ton¬† Why do you care so much?_ ‚Äã¬†Mac Ton¬† you don't know facts, you think you do, but what you have is 'current understandings' the only FACT here is that you are unable to accept new potential understandings because they make you uncomfortable._ Mac Ton¬† She is a woman though.\nYou are just incorrect._ @tiezukae¬† Chromosomes don't lie, but nice try spouting your postmodernist nonsense_ Here before the comments get banned.

This is real. Happy 420 tho._ LOL did he just say vaccinat_ It's honestly so gross that everyone is commenting on her appearance and not on her intellect. If she was dressed like a \"man\" and in a suit and tie I bet all of you would be clapping and praising her to the high heavens.

It is called science fiction_ I love how almost no one discussed about her speech but just stopped at the fact that she's transgender like it's the only thing that matters, real classy._ Why do some of you hate change so much?_ As a biological woman can someone please explain to me why transgender people are so influenced by external identification of what a woman is. \nIt‚Äôs a real question, I‚Äôm not making a sarcastic remark.\nThis TED talk is so odd._ A skirt full of books!!!¬† I like it!¬† I shouldn't expect any less of you. Your story \"The City In The Middle Of The Night\" is one of my favourite sci-fi books. I love your writing and imagination and your intelligence! Odyssey like stories are my favourite and you are very good at that. Thank you!_ Thank you so much for your talk, I'll let me free to imagine from now.

Would you think they shouldn't talk publicly because of their hair?\nIf I got a book skirt (which I want so much now!) do you think I shouldn't be able to talk publicly?_ @RebeccaKatsuya¬† If you are invited to perform at TED, would you wear your pijamas? Based on the theme, with that pink wig I would wear a clean white outfit, maybe cyan. Instead she creates discomfort and go against her speech. Honestly, did she looked good on stage? No. When you perform on stage, you should dress properly and accordingly to your performance. What if the lead singer of Cats would wear a coast guard uniform instead of a cat mascot/makeup. Just because she felt like it? The audiance would be like, wtf give my money back and the actress would be fired that night. Or is she an exeption, because who he is? Then I am the one being negatively discriminated here._ she?_ @TheJorgeb¬† I think she looked fine. She wore a skirt covered in books, which for an author talking about writing books is just wonderful. (I had that skirt I'd wear it everywhere.) \nShe wore pink hair which is not unusual for her. I genuinely don't see what is wrong with it.\nShe was giving a talk, not in a workplace with a uniform or in a play with costumes.\nIf you give a ted talk you can wear the same if you want to, so no one is discriminating against you there._ üëÄthat's a sad person bullying others for attention_ Hes talking as though he invented sci-fi._ Not sure but  she or they seems non binary or trans or at least eccentric so why they are at Ted  talks women which promotes segregation and genderisation I dunno why agree to be \nWants their moments of fame and to share a intersting message no matter what i guess_ There is a bit of an advantage to having something so obvious for people to mock. Its harder when you arent being genuine and then they mock. \n\nI dont think anyone would fake it to this point. ‚òù_ No, we need a cure. If you are going to dream about anything, dream about that._ @Aspartame69¬† She did say she hoped for a future with better options for transgender people. I do hope for that too, I hope for a future where medical transition will be safer & easier for transgender people. \nI also hope for a future where social transition will be safer, with less threat of violence, as hopefully there will be less bigotry & transphobia prevalent in the future. \nWe can but imagine & hope._ Cannot agree more üòÅ_ Great pointüëç_ You should put that on a T-shirt._ I have faith in people and what they can do. It will be better in the future._ Thanks_ I think she is bisexual actually._ Chaotic Mandala i never expected to see stephanie from lazy town again._ @aoflex¬† she's clearly not ur just small minded luv_ Yes, she is a science Fiction writer. Thank you for your observation._ Shes transgendered? I thought it was just a man in a skirt and pink hair. Sorry i didnt realise._ Wait... thats not a cross dressing man?_ Pretty sure that's just a guy in a wig..._ @Aspartame69¬† That is fair enough. \nThey use female pronouns in the description.\nUnfortunately there are lots of comments where they are using male pronouns for her on purpose, & being generally quite nasty. Making a mistake is fine, but the actual transphobia in the other comments is just really unpleasant._ @RebeccaKatsuya¬† Ok fine, but if you dont mind ill stick to the pronouns that my eyes attribute to him. He can use whatever pronouns he wishes to use for himself if he wants to refer to himself in the 3rd person that is._ @Rebecca Panayi-Sjotun I identify as a woman. Send me to a female prison if I commit any crime_ Well it is clearly engulfed her entire identity so..._ Honestly the only comments I see are LazyTown jokes. But that's a dude._ it's not change.  it's a freakin' nightmare_ @aoflex¬† You clearly don't though. \nIf you worked in mental health with trans patients then you would know that part of the talking therapy treatment is gender affirmation. We use the pronouns they want us to use.\nAll your comments have been things like; \"that's a man\", when the speaker uses female pronouns. (See the description.) \nNo mental health professional would be saying that about a trans woman they were working with, so I doubt very much that you are \"working to understand them\".\n\nIf you do want to understand trans people; start from a point of empathy rather than mocking or disdain._ 1G3001¬† Uhm you must be 50 year old if A) you think kids still use the showers in schools and B) a trans girl would ever shower nude exposed like that... U clearly don't know anything about any of the people you're talking about cuz you're stuck inside looking out the window at all the people having fun without you while you sit there sad stuck in the past. ^^^ And Thank u Becca  Exactly_ There's scientific evidence that backs up the idea that conservative brains react more strongly to fear. They're literally afraid even if they don't realize it themselves._ ‚Äã¬†@tina8796¬† You have no idea what a nightmare is.

You leftists are revolting and your evil must be stopped if society is to have any chance of surviving._ @DogratDavis¬† have you even seen trump's tweets? Some of them are like a toddler having a tantrum_ 1G3001¬† if that \"beautiful Tweener preiod\" is ruined by allowing another person to be happy then the kid doesn't deserve it I the first place._ ‚Äã¬†@DogratDavis¬†  you literally kick and scream when you see a trans woman wearing a dress, all you have to do it get on with your life. Trans people have to deal with ridiculous amounts of abuse and still manage to be generally decent people, something I really don't think you are capable of. Something really tells me that you are clueless about the concept of strength honestly. Your concept of strength is merely window shopping._ @remyllebeau77¬†  Yes, wanting to prevent death is evil, good effort._ @tiezukae¬† You don't prevent death, you are cheerleading for it in multiple ways._ @DogratDavis¬†  I never said you were, I'm center-left not far left, cultural appropriation and virtue signaling can go suck a turd, I simply feel strongly about accepting trans people from the interactions I've had with them, the whole process of transitioning is massively about managing expectations, Trans people accept how they will be treated, how much they will have to pay, and that some things will always be outside their reach, many of them get kicked out of their homes and it's next to impossible for a lot of them to get jobs due to employment bias, this is all stuff that they have to come to terms with if they want to get what they want. Despite all this, they do it anyway. That is not a weakness, that's called fighting for your own happiness despite being dealt a bad hand._ It depends on dysphoria, but also, have you seen the comments? In order to be recognized and respected as their identity, trans people have a lot of pressure to fully present as the gender they identify with._ Fandyus what‚Äôs mtf?_ @fandyus4125¬† Autogynephilia is outdated & not credible or used at all in modern medicine.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/6czRFLs5JQo_ @RebeccaKatsuya¬†do you have a real source instead?

It's already difficult enough  coming up with good plots and characters, and then there is so much to research and even if you do, you still have to make most of this future up in your brain while also trying to make sure it makes some scientific and social sense. Which is very difficult, especially when you lack the necessary knowledge.

They've crossed it. It's that simple._ @ComputerScienceMajor1¬† so? No one really cares. Ted's going to do them and you do you. Doubt they'll miss you or anyone else for that matter. \n\nTed talks is about sharing ideas and challenging minds. Sure the presenter might look unconventional. Sure their speech might  not sit with you. But it is what it is. If that makes you want to leave, then sure go for it. Perhaps you shouldn't have been on the platform to begin with_ @MrChampionchimp¬† Apparently you care. Why else would you answer?_ People should be jailed for wrongthink._ Wrongthink...its like you all read 1984 and thought it was something to emulate. Not the dystopian future it actually is. üò†üòñ_ She's a writer.

It ruins this really lovely ted talk when you look down & there is just a whole sewage system full of bigotry.\nI just don't get it._ @Jeffp2k5¬† Yes, because those are her pronouns. Why not use the pronouns that people prefer?_ @RebeccaKatsuya¬† because science._ @RebeccaKatsuya¬† what he's getting at is that for sci-fi writing you need to study modern technology instead of a mix of anti-depressants, hallucogenics and alcohol._ @ihormuzyka8553¬† biology is a science. Sociology is a pas-time._ @ihormuzyka8553¬† but does reject biology, the hard science._ @sebastiaandewit159¬† Science does not discredit the trans experience, but affirms it. \nMedical treatment nowadays includes gender affirmation, because our understanding of how to treat people with gender dysphoria is to help them transition  & to affirm their gender & their experience._ I don't care about the social/gender bullshit...but let's be frank...A writer's Imagination is a admitted small part of problem solving world issues. Get the fucking experience/knowledge down._ Him_ That's why the druggie in this film will always stay inept._ @sebastiaandewit159¬† What makes you think she is a \"druggie\"?_ Oof._ @RebeccaKatsuya¬† She? üôÑ_ It's a man, baby._ @HeroesFail¬†  ??_ @HeroesFail¬† she_ Mac Ton¬† well ....  damm_ I‚Äôll take the past, thanks._ why's is everyone saying \"Tedwomen ruled by a man\" is this supposed to be a Ted for Women?_ I love our world thanks to the diversity some of our society accepts and i hope to see a lot more diverse people to be able to be more myself. The content of this video is so inspiring!

Or not. It's none of our business. And also makeup and dress? It's 2020 ffs, if someone likes that, let them, it's really none of your business either. \nThis is also TEDTalks, you should be focusing on what is said, not how the speaker looks. Smh y'all are mad about anything that is not heteronormative_ im not gonna judge the TALK based on the appearance of the presenter.\nwhen you actually listen to her, it's a really interesting talk._ Everything wrong with society explained by someone who is my worst nightmare of the future. Ted started so well now it's endorsing pedofilia and this crap_ Amazing_ I have just read Rockefeller's \"Scenarios for the Future of Technology and International Development\".\n Someone had \"imagined\" lock step in 2010 üòÇ  \nAnd now I'm watching this üòÑ_ If we dont change the trajectory of our future, we won't have one_ Is that Stephanie from lazy town?

Ted talks work!!!!!_ Firts_ Same_ Why?_ kevin ur face should be a meme... in a good way_ @dAVAb AI won't dress up like a girl._ @RebeccaKatsuya¬† because actually believing there are more than two genders or dressing up as your \"preferred\" gender is utter nonsense and we shouldn't be following those nonsensical ideas into the future_ @SNAPLINKSLLC¬† Oh right, just transphobia then._ @RebeccaKatsuya¬† that's not transphobia it's being candid frank and right at the same time ( ‡≤†‚Äø‡≤†)_ @RebeccaKatsuya¬† yea my brothers gay friend(who has conservative views) is transphobic. Just because someone doesn't agree with your way of thinking doesn't make them transphobic._ You're old though. You would lol_ J Henshaw That‚Äôs no fun._ Rewatch the beginning.. says it's a TEDWomen event.._ Hahahaha_ No_ \"Inspiring\" - they haven't said anything that hasn't been said before._ @HeavensEye666¬† Perhaps they said something that sarahc00kies hadn't heard before, or something they might have heard but maybe it resonated more hearing it this time around from this speaker. \nSarahc00kies found it inspiring. \nWhy do you care to try to correct other people about what inspires them?_ Rebecca Panayi-Sjotun i‚Äôm happy you tried to make those idiot understand. The thing with people like @antonyGilmer is if they contradict a subjective point of view, they are really dumb. Don‚Äôt waste your time on people like themüôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è_ @sarahc00kies¬† I've been inspired too honestly. I've listened to this talk like 3 times now because my head has been buzzing with ideas, & I've seen other people in the comments here also coming up with interesting ideas from this, so I get it & you aren't alone. üòä_ No_ @MoarteaLunii¬† why not_ perfect._ Exactly_ Finn MacCool¬† I'm mad about people thinking everyone should go by one rule_ @ChrisDragotta¬† Why is it gross????_ We need more thought police just like you. Thanks for shaming the critics. If only we could censor them and remove from social media. If we decide that 2+2=5, then we need to enforce this truth, and delete the naysayers. And its not enough to accept it as truth, we must believe it as truth. Keep up the diligence._ @ChrisDragotta¬† well said._ @CHAS1422¬† ???? I have absolutely no idea what you just meant by this but ok._ @vivientakacs5599¬† Because it's a manifestation of a unreproductive fork of human behavior. Finding those kinds of expressions distasteful is a evolutionary deeply conserved norm.  We are looking at a male presenting as something she isn't talking about a future she will never biologically substantiate._ @InMaTeofDeath¬† Freedom of speech unless it affects someone negatively, also don't be surprised if you are getting negative responses. You should also be respecting others. But basic respect is obviously a skill a lot of you lack. Also if someone showed up in a furry outfit, I would still watch and listen the same way I do when someone wears formal clothes._ @thinkppl¬† üòÇüòÇüòÇ NORM üòÇüòÇüòÇ \nWait till you all find out that make up and dresses/skirts as well as high heels were originally made for men. Men of higher power too. Someone who was socially higher like rulers, kings and emperors had make up, a lot of them had wigs dating back to hundreds of years. Pharaos had also a lot of make up, which identified who the specific pharaoh was. But also a lot of other things. Look at paintings of men that had some higher powers from 1600s mostly from Europe, they all had wigs, as well as high heels lmao. Also clothing is clothing, make up is beautiful if done correctly and nail polish is a fun thing to do üòÇüòÇ_ Vivien Takacs facts üíØ_ WTF! Ever!_ @vivientakacs5599¬† that's not make up idiot, if i care about how i look and care about my hair, skin, that means i am a women? Wtf is wrong with you?? The kings you was talking about in the past, they didn't wear women clothes or act like a women_ @Yuzema¬† I wasn't saying that??? Re-read my comment lmao. I didn't say nor did I imply that if you do any of those then you are a woman. They indeed wear clothing that was similar to skirts though. But saying that dresses and skirts are for women is bs. They are for people. So that you don't walk naked on the street lol. So am I because I dont wear any dress or high heel or make up a man? No of course not. But wearing pants isn't seen as bad, as soon as a man wears something that is labelled for women they are gay/trans??? No._ You mean him ?_ When socialists took over the media & morals in the 60s, we get this._ When did Ted endorse paedophilia?_ @RebeccaKatsuya¬† they had some girl telling a story of this poor man who would never know love. Because he liked kids. It was sickening. But it was definitely softening people up and it got applauded I don't know names._ Rebecca Panayi-Sjotun they‚Äôve had at least two instances of speakers advocating for pedophilia._ This is quite the irony when everyone has been isolated and fed 24/7 corona this and corona that.. the apparent level of confusion is being feedback looped to us as a high intellectual conversation summarising events of catastrophies are daily and not to panick made reassurringly by a man who thinks as being a woman, wearing a pink hair to confirm the visual status in case any self doubt is still remnant while attending tedwomen talk! I guess this so supposed to be a WtF moment to take a breather and laugh?\n\nWho would not be wondering after watching this https://youtu.be/7WeTiIoL3Xw\n\nNice one!_ We Rotate around Our Star, we don't have much say in that._ @HeavensEye666¬† Good job on completely missing the point._ That's a man._ @MoarteaLunii¬† She is man now? Wastern culture is really pucked up_ @ÍπÄÏùµÎ™Ö-d3j¬† No he's wearing a wig._ Deadass why i clicked the video üòÇ_ she_ Onii Chan Does it matter?_ Better than damaging your hair with different types of dyes, not to mention you can go from short to to waist long hair all you want with wigs. Is it really that important to you?_ He_ @priyanka singh I'm not the one on the picture lmao, he's a rapper. But even so it's people's choice what they want to do with their hair, or if they want to wear a wig. But why make such a big deal out of it. It's not you who is doing it, so it's not your business._ @InMaTeofDeath¬† Yes it matters to her, and that's why she is doing it. Does it change your life though? Does it hurt you? Unless you feel personally attacked, which is your own problem, you should not be concerned with what others do, unless it is negative for them_ @MoarteaLunii¬† She\nY'all's basic respect is horrible_ He might be wearing a wig or his hairdresser worked extra hard to make him fabulous!_ @aoflex¬† They want to be adressed as she/her so I'm going to do that because that is the respectful way. Also idgaf I'm lying every day, you most likely do too._ @aoflex¬†Do you think biology omits the brain?\nNeuroscience & neurobiology is still a part of science & biology. \nWhen studying neurobiology scientists have to rely in part on our ability to communicate our experience, because our experience is a part of what is being studied. Modern medicine has to also rely on our verbal communication of our experience.\nModern medical treatment for transgender people is to affirm their gender through transition. That is what science tells us is the best & most helpful thing to do, to treat their dysphoria by helping them transition, medically &/or socially; whatever they feel helps them. \n\nYou can get upset about transgender people existing, but that doesn't stop transgender people existing. \nYour feelings on their presentation & transition really doesn't matter to anyone but you. Your feelings on the matter doesn't change the fact that modern medicine affirms transgender people._ She‚Äôs a woman._ @funnymusicfreak¬†ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£üñêÔ∏èüñêÔ∏èü§£_ They have been gagged and hog tied._ @funnymusicfreak¬† woman....adult human female...how many fingers, Winston?_ @funnymusicfreak¬† It pretends to be a woman... someone needs to blow its cover... :D_ Human right. Make world better and better !_ She is a woman._ @RebeccaKatsuya¬† that's not what that adam's apple says...also, I don't think it has female reproductive systems... and just to note on why am I calling this person 'IT' - I do it out of respect, this person clearly doesn't want to be associated as a male, weird decision, but it can be respected, and the reason why I am not calling this person a \"SHE\" is out of respect for women everywhere, this person biologically can never be a woman, no matter how badly it wants to identify itself as such, you cannot change/fake your DNA...so in a nutshell...calling this person a 'HE' is disrespectful toward this person, and calling it a \"SHE\" is disrespectful to woman...there's just no win-win situation here. And as a note: don't misunderstand the trans movement things with gay rights, it would be like comparing apples to asbestos..._ @tkondor¬† Calling anyone \"it\" is disrespectful. \nIf you are so rude you won't use someone's preferred pronouns then you could still use they & them, which are gender neutral pronouns.\n\nShe is a trans woman. She has transitioned & lives as a woman, & legally she is a woman, so I will refer to her as such. Apart from anything else it is just basic good manners._ The PC police is ok with men pretending to be women, where have you been the past 2 years?_ üíú_ Stfu_ Dr. Lisa Cortez that‚Äôs awesome üëèüèº_ I think I'm early_ Squaa_ H_ jeffree star???_ First comment again_ First_ Fj_ ‚Äç_ JeromeAngelo Encarnacion Never eben this early üòÖ_ Lol_ Exactly what I was thinking about"

Starting from barely being able to make a living you get more money the more the demand and the less the candidates are, there are fewer people who wanna be farmers and farmers are also diying, the demand is there and the candidates are few, so wages for farmers should be going up.

In so doing we may educate the urban mass of the vitality of Rural production to the stocking of the supermarket shelves and the rag trade (clothing)\nThat interconnected world also threatens farmers all over (for example The African Swine Fever).

From the Philippines._ It's a shame that as a Ted speaker, he bought politics into his talk. The guidelines say no religion or politics from a Ted stage (I know, because I've done one ) But he missed a very important point of why the framers dont get enough money and that's because the system is set up for the money and ultimately pricing control, to go to the food processors. They make the big bucks, not the guy who actually tills the land and grows the produce.  So if anything has to change, then that would be top of my list. Let's stop eating refined crap that the proccesors are actually allowed to call food! Often times it is so far removed from what left the farm:-(_ Farmers are cool. They need to know tech, engineering, biology, businesses etc in today's world. I think we don't need as many farmers as we used to do because technology has increased yields so much. One single farmer today can probably generate 100x more yield than a 100 farmers together a hundred years ago.

My father farmed (tobacco, corn, soybean), my uncle was a dairy/beef/pork farmer, as was my grandpa.

You can‚Äôt live in fear of that, it‚Äôs silly_ I agree with your point but he is  ot talking about CAFOs. He's talking about proper farming,  not what's done in factory farms. See my comment earlier:-)_ @thehorsebackheroine5950¬† any farmer that goes public and does not explicitly condemn unethical practices (which is not clear at all from his lecture) that destroy our lives and ecosystems, is a cow-ard.

They are CROOKS._ In the US the corporations don't want to pay for the farm.  So they create exclusive contracts, or they buy out the farmer and pay them next to nothing, while forcing them to fill quotas that are harmful for pretty much everyone involved.\nThis also has the side effect of forcing private farmers to lower their sale prices as the corporate industrial farms and their bad practices are undercutting them beyond what's sustainable.  Since for them the farm itself doesn't have to make money.\nBasically like all things in the US,  the economic environment has become toxic._ Without the rest of us they would have none of the things they take for granted everyday.

Most of that food simply went to waste.   You're right to assume a calorie deficit.  However it's going to happen regardless of whether people go organic or not.

In the end, make the best decision you can but by all means cherish your right to cast  your vote and do so. There is no one who can answer this for you anymore than others can make other important decisions in you life for you.  Thank you for caring and asking the question._ Terry Batdorf clearly Joel Salatin wasn‚Äôt available._ So buy a chunk of land and do it._ Talk is cheap. What's stopping you from doing this now independent of this? What's stopping you from getting tractors to plow, seeding crops, keeping them alive and healthy no matter the weather, wildlife, weeds or whatever else can threaten the crop. How many crops would you grow. Would you grow rice? Potatoes? Wheat? Cotton? Cucumbers? Tomatoes? Carrots? Peas? Beets? Would you maintain all nourishment like calcium, magnesium, potassium, iron, vitamin C, D, E, A, B etc to not cause malnutrition to your family? Then would you have enough manpower to reap everything from sunrise to sunset before that rainstorm that turns everything to mud, or before that snow and freezing temp that damages crop. Would you know what month you'd plant or reap? If you would choose a greenhouse, would you be devoted to water every day? If you'd raise animals and still want to be self sufficient you need a hay field and the machinery to cut the grass, rake the grass, know how long to sun dry it to avoid mold and youd have to depend on matching time with when it rains so it doesn't rain before you cut or while it's drying before you bale it. Tractors break down, bale machines clog up, tractors get stuck in fields. If you don't need grazing fields and hay then you'd need some type of grain depending on the animal and if you don't want to buy grain from someone else then you better grow enough and harvest enough for the whole winter. \n\nIt is super hard to be 100% independent when it comes to feeding a family. You also need to eat during the months the crops grow. Then what?_ @raioswasho733¬† I agree with your analysis of our current societal dynamics and the vast undervaluing of farmer's work and exploitation of them (and the land) generally. My point is a deeper one. Beneath the surface critiques of our current society there are root problems, namely the way our economy and society is built on specialization and efficiency which makes it lean and maximally profitable for some, but as a whole the structure is brittle, lacks any redundancy and is very vulnerable to failure which would cause loss of life and misery in a scale never before seen. This is not farmer's fault, but the existence of \"farmers\" as a role is dependent upon, and supportive of, the larger system of specialization which will lead to disaster.\n\nAnd no, supporting one's own family is not \"farming\" in the modern sense of the word._ @AmbiCahira¬† ¬†Ambi Cahira¬† Are you a farmer? It doesn't sound like it, but feel free to correct if I am wrong. \n\nYou ask why don't I just do this on my own. Before I answer about myself particularly, I will respond to the larger issue your response points to.  You go on an length about the needed knowledge necessary to produce food and sustain life. Your point is that this knowledge is no longer common, and if left to their own competence most people would fail and die. You point this out in an attempt to illustrate to me how grateful I should be that someone else is competence enough to ensure my survival. I fundamentally disagree with the dynamic you have laid out. The system you illuminate and the risks you highlight are precisely why I have the critique that I do. We have built a system where our society is like a upside down pyramid built on the head of a pin. So long as nothing ever comes along to disturb it we can grow exponentially at the top supporting more and more and more people on the farmers who comprise the head of the pin. But this is an inherently dangerous and incredibly frail system. All it takes is a tiny breeze or the lightest tap to send the whole thing crumbling down. \nWe have no redundancy, no back up plan. We are way way overleveraged on our system of specialization and are now generations removed from the knowledge base you mentioned. The entire structure is hugely dangerous. Rather than looking down from the top of the pyramid and calling out thanks to the farmer below, we should immediately throw all our efforts into making their job LESS ESSENTIAL, taking as.muxh weight off their shoulders as possible and building in as much redundancy as we possibly can, we should restructure our society to have a broad and stable base  so that should that tiny breeze come along, rather than everyone in the pyramid DYING we are merely dusted off a bit and we carry on. \n\nIn practical terms this means rather than merely \"appreciating\" the knowledge that farmers have and their efforts to feed society, we should encourage EVERYONE to have knowledge of their own sufficient to feed their own families if the need arises. We should encourage backyard gardening and food independence. We should lessen the burden on farmers as much as possible as a society and ALSO appreciate them for their assistance in keeping everyone fed. To perpetuate our current system will result in disaster and mass death eventually. That is my point.\n\nAs to what I personally do, well you said \"there is nothing stopping me\" actually that is only partially true. The financial opportunity for land ownership is extremely limited now, largely do to industrialized farming (in rural areas) and real estate speculation (everywhere). \nWhat used to be a human right- to have a patch of the Earth from which to feed your family- is now a privilage that few have easy access to. As I mentioned, wage slavery has robbed us all of our freedom and ability to be self sufficient. As for myself I have done and continue to do, everything I can to become as self sufficient as I can just as every citizen should do._ @lorrie2878¬† I did._ @AmbiCahira¬† Also...you said what would we eat in the winter......that is a silly question. Humanity wouldn't exist if we simply stopped eating when the main growing season ended. There are plenty of winter crops and there is also food storage both of which are how humanity survived winter and spring before WWII._ @searose6192¬† You are missing the point. If you single handedly feed your family without any other food sources then you more or less harvest a year worth of food in the fall that you need to store and keep fresh so that you can eat all winter plus the spring and summer until next fall crop._ @searose6192¬† My youtube didn't alert your big reply so I almost missed it. I agree that it would be great if things were unloaded and more could carry the weight but to single handedly feed someone's family you'd have such a big undertaking.

But when it thaws (asks for forgiveness) the water just takes it back, there is no separateness anymore\".

Just saying as I grew up listening to a alcoholic telling me how bad their childhood was and they're are now a 65 grandfather still not taking responsibility for them self and blaming a bad childhood. My childhood ended a long time ago, own your life as a adult and why bother looking back? Carrying that kind of baggage with you only hurts you and future generations._ We all have different gifts. His musical gift is enormous but we all have music in us.  Dont be sorry,  your gift is different. The gift we all have and can develop enormously is love._ 5:33 Viewing from Norway_ I feel like Djesse vol.2 is Jacob giving me a much needed hug.üòä_ I'm expecting Andy from Ceebeebies to pop up beside him, any minute now._ Model of guitar?_ If all holding music were that beautiful id sit in a call que all day long._ I don't think we can ever thank you enough._ me: gOd his posture\n\nalso me: has the same posture when playing_ This is why I love TED_ Watching from Taiwan!_ He better be selling that logic session shirt_ Every song he sung left me speechless, but that rendition of Danny Boy was just G O D D A M N_ Watching from Montreal, Canada üá®üá¶üçÅüá®üá¶_ Anybody know where he got that jacket tho? üëÄüëÄ_ What microphone is he using?_ Young count Olaf_ This felt like a piece of heaven.

Helfgott_ I've never seen someone moisturize their thumb mid performance, this guy is a ridiculous and ingenious musician_ The tuning for sky above is DAEGAD btw Im tryna figure the song out_ Theres so many sprinkles of genius hidden throughout this video that most people will miss and its bloody fantastic_ Does anyone know the tuning in The Sun is in Your Eyes?_ One can only listen in awe at the muscicianship. Brilliance used to the right degree - in keeping with each song. No showing off. Feel privileged to be part of the \"crowd\", and the storytelling in each song. Thank you Jacob._ Jacob is just a gift to our generation. So sad I missed this live.

Thank god for this video ‚ù§Ô∏è_ Towns county,, Georgia USA. Lying in bed, scrolling my YouTube feed at 6am. What a surprise to find your video. So unique. Pure genius. Thank you for sharing. Best of luck to you._ I have to have \"The Sun Is In Your Eyes\" !!_ My only wish is that the instruments were mic'd up.

Thank you Jacob Collier for sharing your expansive light‚ú® and all of these incredible ethereal insightsüïäü¶ãü™Å_ what reverb is that_ Jacob could be the host of a kids‚Äô show and I‚Äôd watch it every single day_ The on key bird songs in the background of hideaway was a nice a touch until you modulate on the bridge hahah_ Goodness... the ending of Danny Boy was incredible._ Blenheim NZ._ you're not alone dude_ How can you not fall in love with this music and the man, it's only natural   I feel something very like that myself.....thank you for posting your love...._ @missellenmartin4152¬† and where's your proof for that? Nobody is gonna believe you_ MissEllenMartin you really need help man. Talk to a therapist because somethings wrong in your brain._ MissEllenMartin if this is real, please tell me because if not, this seems really unhealthy_ Ha! I relate to this so hard. In fact, i refer to Jacob as \"my boyfriend Jacob\" when talking about him to my girlfriend._ @missellenmartin4152¬† time for your meds_ MissEllenMartin could you give us some evidence of this? Im all for believing you but I‚Äôve seen people fake these things all the time._ haha damn the comments on this video are so great. and funny... and deep.

I'm married btw_ 1 minute in and I'm so relaxed... there is something about him_ jacobs got that mr. rogers aura_ dat egg cardboard tho_ You got to stop doing these shows and get the quadruplets out ASAP!!!_ Now I have an idea of where my share (and many thousands more) of musical talent went. Jacob, many thanks for your extraordinary skills from Panama üáµüá¶ . Btw if you are the recipient of my absent talent I'm happy. I wouldn't have been able to do much with it anyway üòâ_ Young Keanu Reeves playing piano_ Mr. Rogers? Is that you?_ What is the book on the piano? Looks like it says J. S. Bach but I'm not sure_ ü•∫‚ù§Ô∏è_ I don‚Äôt have any serious musical education. I sang in choir when I was young, and messed around on and off for a few years on drums and guitar, but I haven‚Äôt stuck with them religiously. \n\nMy problem is that most of Jacob Collier‚Äôs music doesn‚Äôt sound all that nice to me. Don‚Äôt take this the wrong way; I recognize how brilliant of a musician he is (literally on par with the greatest names in history), but I find myself often bothered by the complexity of his songs. Is it just because I  have a very low musical IQ? Do most people who are not particularly musically-inclined feel the same way? It honestly bothers me sometimes because I see a musical genius and want to appreciate his work, but I feel almost incapable of fully appreciating him as an artist._ that opposed left-hand chromatic movement at 29:51 paid my rent and cured my arthritis holy moly_ When it's just him and his piano, his love for folk songs really comes through._ His unbelievable command of falsetto is rarely mentioned in comments üõ∏_ Hi Jacob, thanks for your inspirational music, love what you're doing!_ Listening to this while burning incense is an incredible experience_ The only draw back of being that good a musician is bad posture._ How on earth have triple digit people disliked this? It's like hating on Mr Rogers. You are a spectacular, glorious musical wizard, JC and we absolutely fucking LOVE you x_ why does he have Mister Rogers energy here_ I always say Jacob collier does not play the piano but he is playing the song_ 2:31 üò≠_ might be. I heard him say somewhere: \"I used to sing Bach chorales with my family. It was grand fun, actually!\"_ actually it looks like J.S. Bach's Musical Offering, but can't quite make it out_ I think I definitely found this maybe 2 years ago, I slowly introduced myself to more complex music, and built from there. I know what you mean when it can be daunting trying to approach listening to a something with this much harmonic and rhythmic complexities. There are some videos here on YouTube that can give more guidance on listening too it. \n\nThere is also a beauty, I feel, of not demistifying the music too much, and just letting it sweep through you._ I think it both depends on your personal taste and also exposure! A lot of people have the same with classical music. It's just \"too much\". But there are also  people who \"understand\" the music and have been exposed to it a lot who still don't like it. I don't think it has anything to do with your \"musical IQ\", although expose might help. You could also just not like this kind of complex music. If you really want to appreciate it more, work your way up through jazz and start with easier-to-hear tunes :)_ Micah Scanzillo Even as a pianist, I agree. I appreciate his musical genius and find it fascinating,  but at the same time I don‚Äôt enjoy his musical style personally. It‚Äôs just not my kind of music.\n\nEven when the artist is clearly extraordinary, at the end of the day you‚Äôre still listening to music, and people simply have differing tastes._ @minigooshey¬† exactly! I also play piano, and i enjoy baroque music a lot. However, sometimes Jacob is just so.. wide in his chords? that I feel overwhelmed. It really depends on your mood as well:)_ @ceetah02¬† yeah I feel definitely bebop jazz music is a good place to start, it gives you something to listen out too, and build from there. I would recommend my favourite things by John Coltrane, and autumn leaves by Chet baker_ I'm a music theory nerd so sometimes his music is pleasing, in a conceptual way.\n\nBut even so, I don't like all his songs. I have several favorites and it's because they make sense to me, but there's stud that's definitely \"outside\" the usual spectrum of harmony that I no longer appreciate it.\n\nSimply like what you like :) I usually like his softer and more naked arrangements too._ For me, I have no music theory background. ( I'm working on that now ) I've been playing for ten years now ( guitar drums bass and keys; just picked up a sax and violin, and can do decent vocals. ) I've only been playing by \"feel\" so far, and that's what got me stuck on JC. He has all of this feeling in his music that makes sense to me, and I am slowly but surely learning more and more about theory as I go. Basically finding his music was life changing for me haha_ Everything great is unavoidable if you give it time. Jacob is great in every way. He just has a million shades of emotion and tonal colors to play with and express himself. It still takes commitment, like most things worth having._ Haha i feel you. Some days with certain moods i like listening to his songs and how he sings, some other days, I'm like nope, my ears can't take it, next. Yea, he might be a genius, but we don't have to appreciate him to the standard that others do, it's ok to feel and think differently. It just means that we're different and that is all üòä_ You must be really fun at parties_ I'm a bad musician and still have bad posture..._ @MurphyMan997¬† oh, I usually say, the only drawback to getting drunk is teenage pregnancy, puking, and all the other things you'll regret the following morning. Like the walk of shame from HIMYM._ And sleep deprivation._ Cool_ Thank you for sharing your energy with very special music you create where love   meet peace.üôè_ The word \"musical virtuoso\" doesn't even begin to describe the utter phenomenon that Jacob Collier is.  Every music instrument I've seen him touch just becomes an extension of his hands._ Sad to have missed in Cape Town Jazz Festival. But happy to see him here. Thanks for the beautiful music Jacob!_ What is special about this guy? Looks like a normal pop singer,songwriter to me. No crazy talent or whatever, its mediocre._ They are his songs, but please note: he is improvising a great deal of the piano part !!!  Truly amazing talent to sing and improvise at the same time, just inspirational_ the shirt_ I didn't expect a song premiere!_ Best Danny Boy cover, ever!_ 30:39 \"Love you so........\"üéπüéµ\n\nLuv ur soul Jacob!‚ù§_ I wonder what the range of his voice_ Totally amazing_ He's the Carl Sagan of music_ DAD_ Dude John Mayer and Jacob Collier colab needs to happen_ I didn't know Mr. Rogers got reincarnated as a musician_ Beautiful songs Jacob! Support from Wuhan_ for me, he is just the most inspiring musician I have ever seen, honestly, I am studying so much, maybe someday I can reach his level, thanks Jacob_ Would have preferred if he had just played some of the bach that was in front of him_ Streamers when they get their first viewer, 5:01_ Yup_ extension of his mind/heart/soul*_ More like it fusions with, it's like a musical marriage they became one (sorry for the cheeseyness)_ His hands don‚Äôt just play, the dance, they fly over whatever he is playing._ Of his spirit even_ AN EXTENSION OF  T H E   S O U L_ Check his yt channel for explanation :-)_ Also listen to his cover in BBC Maida Vale session. It‚Äòs completely different, but no less fascinating._ Make sure your music actually has emotional value too_ I know I'll NEVER reach his level, but I draw inspiration from him every time I listen to one of his songs or one of his master classes... The man is truly one of the greats, and I can't help but think that he's only getting started. What a ride we're in for. Thank you, Jacob._ Hello from New York Jacob._ Sky above, such a beautiful song. Honestly, blows my mind. Love to Jacob._ The audio quality on this matches the musical quality. I would listen to Jacob do whatever he wants to in his room for hours if I could. ‚ù§Ô∏è Love you bud. Simply amazing._ thank you_ im from India a music lover i took up learning late but its going to stay ......cheers to your magnanimous voice_ ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to figure out what key I want to play in‚Äù  this man really has every key at his disposal. So amazing._ you make me cry ._ Very interesting to hear these songs stripped down to their roots. I love this._ I love you_ Could you imagine if he was the host of like a Mr. Roger‚Äôs style show but about music theory and stuff? I‚Äôd watch every episode_ I could watch Jacob wait till the internet figures itself all day_ Giraffe from Berlin Germany!_ The sun was definitely in my eyes, Jacob. Thank you for your brilliant performances. You continue to be awe-inspiring and my true motivation for studying music passionately. Cheers._ Sounds like the king a bit_ Listening from Italy, also quarantined at home, it's like 6 weeks now. Your songs keep us company every day, because my one year old is fascinated by you and your music. Thank you for being so special. We love you ‚ù§_ This mans casually has 4 grammies in the background..._ I wanna watch a Hayao Miyazaki movie with original score by Jacob Collier._ Jacob Collier is a window to some other universe I hope we'll discover some day._ SENSATIONAL CONCERT!  Thanks VERY much!_ This guy is MUSIC itself. Amazing. Love it._ Hmm... Maybe I'll try D half# major today_ He's trying to figure out which key he wants to try and wedge his music into because, in truth, he has the whole sonic spectrum to work with and his instruments limit him to 12-tone equal temperament._ @blubberdust¬†  That's quite literally true with him lol. His music really highlights what well-temperament can be pushed to._ @kylesnowden6656¬† perfect pitch_ There are hours of video of him talking about music!\nhttps://youtu.be/eRkgK4jfi6M <-- This may be the most famous of them_ He should totally do a theory playlist or something. Or write a book._ Yes!! Omg he gives me such a Mr. Rogers vibe. Like just looking at his videos makes me feel better._ YEESSS I NEEED_ I‚Äôm ready for the next episode._ LEGIT I WAS THINKING THE SAME THING_ That‚Äôs a super good idea!!_ Stephen Klehm I love the video you linked and there's also one where he breaks down Stevie Wonder's Sir Duke. I could listen to him for hours!_ You might fall asleep._ That's exactly what I thought too at the beginning of this!_ How about Adam Neely - he's awesome, already does theory talks on his channel (but alone). They should collaborate_ Elizabeth Kim wonderful idea!_ I WAS LOOKING FOR THIS COMMENT AFTER THE INTRO OMG_ this is that video_ i feel the connection!!_ That would be good obviously but I kinda don't want him to be wasting time for that._ BEST!_ So much YES!_ literally his entire youtube channel - he's the bob ross and mr rogers of music all at once and he's so wittle still_ @netflix_ I had the same immediate first impression._ That part_ literally came looking for more jacob collier content after a mr rogers deep dive so yes_ This NEEDS to happen!_ I‚Äôd kill for that_ I need that_ Just awesome!_ Yes or like a music podcast!!!_ THIS needs to be a real thing <3_ You can watch every episode now.. He has recorded master classes.. I've been watching all of his videos on his YouTube channel,, and there are hours and hours of exactly what you're describing. Subscribe, and down the beautiful rabbit hole you go. He transcends music theory, and plays with all the magic in between that they don't teach at music school. No one has ever even thought the music he makes before._ Me too! It would be awesome!_ oh my gosh yes_ This is a genius idea_ I could_ OH MY GOD yes_ OMG_ Oh man you‚Äôre SO RIGHT LIZ_ Literally in tears listening to this. It‚Äôs just catching me on the right day two years later._ Instantly what I thought when he opened his mouth_ I hope maybe he'll do this when he's older and maybe done with touring and other busywork._ Exactly. üòä. \"Jacob's Music Room.\"\nKey difference is that Fred Rogers didn't have his Emmy Awards in the backround._ ‚Äã¬†@lottecollin5268¬†Could easily be a series of books, textbooks, an encyclopedia of his work._ Jibster my gosh i didn‚Äôt even see them, jeez_ Just a subtle flex, nothing to see here_ Sitting on the Wurli he got one of them on ;)_ Only the beginning_ They seem well-deserved to me, but it's still somewhat pretentious._ John Given pretentious? No way. If you earned them, you wouldn‚Äôt hide them in a cupboard, would you? Good for him!_ Other artits made fancy spots to put in it._ And... He is just 25..._ @MusicSounds¬† so subtle_ @jpgcomposer¬† pretentious? jesus man who hurt you? Of course you display your Grammys for people to see._ @thertcll¬† Nobody hurt me. And I think Jacob is terrific. But just FYI, I keep my music emmy high on a shelf in an out-of-the-way place. I would find displaying it prominently to be rather obnoxious. Perhaps JC just doesn't have good storage available. Displaying them or not doesn't take away from the important part, which is the great music. Getting a grammy for it doesn't make it better or worse._ he actually plays them_ and he deserves every single one._ @jpgcomposer¬† you know what John Given? When you have won 4 Grammys, then you can make a comment. Until then the best you can do for the world is to STFU, please._ Edison Wato maybe abit harsh, but ok_ John Given watch some of his videos and you‚Äôll see how humble he is:)_ @jpgcomposer¬† So showing any achievement you have ever gotten is pretentious? I don't understand your logic at all._ @bloomhh7639¬† It's amazing to me how bent out of shape some have gotten over my comment. Of course the awards are well-deserved, but come on, it's a little pretentious. FWIW, I consider the achievement to be the music, which isn't made better or worse because it received recognition. The awards are nice, of course, and perhaps help sell records, which is a nice thing for him and to get the music out.¬†\n\nBy the way, I like your Frank Z profile pic. Of the Grammy Awards, Frank once said in an interview (Cleveland Plain Dealer): My nomination must have been an accident. Either that or a lot of people have a perverse sense of humour. I'm convinced that nobody ever heard [it]. I have no ambiguous feelings about the Grammys at all. I know they're fake. I find it difficult to believe that Whitney Houston is the answer to all of America's music needs._ @jpgcomposer¬† When did I ever defend the grammy's? Or day I liked whitney houstons's music at all? I just don't get how you think it's bad or \"pretentious\" in your eyes that someone who has achieved something that most people will never be able to literally has it in the background, nowhere near the centre of attention, it's just displayed there, does he mention of it? No. It's laughable how you think it's wrong or something for him to have an award in his room that you can just so happen to see. Maybe so many are replying to your comment because you're acting like an idiot who gets offended by everything._ @bloomhh7639¬† Some people have no sense of humor. I'd expect a Frank fan to get it. I think his take would be closer to mine, was my point. For the record, I think Whitney Houston is also terrific (though I wish her song choices had been of commensurate quality as her incredible talent)._ ‚Äã¬†@jpgcomposer¬† Lol such a funny joke am i right MegaLul HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHHA MegaLul HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHHA MegaLul HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHHA_ @jpgcomposer¬† IDK smoke em if you got em. Flaunt em if you got em IMO. He is humble asf for how talented he is._ @jpgcomposer¬†your original comment does indicate an underlying jealousy and judgement or you wouldn‚Äôt have expressed it in the first place. Recognizing this is the first step toward healing your ‚Äúhurt‚Äù (if you so choose)..Best!_ @rcc3574¬†People have read so much into an off-hand comment in which I also say JC's awards were well-deserved. I don't know why that strikes a nerve with so many._ it's not at all. you are judging the wrong person. they are always in the same place (in his room on the wurli) and not for the video.¬†@jpgcomposer_ ‚Äã¬†@jpgcomposer¬† just look up the definition of pretentious. You are implying Jacob doesn't possess the talent that is claimed by the awards given for his achievements. Displaying awards that are well-earned is not pretentious. Boastful, perhaps. Words matter._ @jeremyfishman¬† It is funny how wound up my comment has people 3 years on, especially when I've also said I think Jacob is quite deserving of the both the grammy awards and all the attention he gets, I just thought it's a little tacky to display grammy awards where they will be surely seen on online videos.¬†It is unnecessary self-promotion.\n\nRe definitions: Pretentious (adj): \"characterized by pretension\" - pretension (noun): \"a claim or right to attention or honor because of merit,\" also \"vanity, pretentiousness.\" Seems pretty right-on to me. These come from Merriam-Webster online._ @jpgcomposer¬† it's funny how you keep replying, claiming it's funny that no one listens to you, while ignoring their valid points about your comment. You seem to need the last word.\n\nCase in point, you literally left out the majority the MW definition body for \"pretentious\" to try and rebut my comment:\n\n characterized by pretension: such as\na: making usually unjustified or excessive claims (as of value or standing)\nthe pretentious fraud who assumes a love of culture that is alien to him\n‚ÄîRichard Watts\nb: expressive of affected, unwarranted, or exaggerated importance, worth, or stature\npretentious language_ @jeremyfishman¬† Dude, words have more than one meaning. I don't need to have the last word (which you will allow me to prove if you respond further)._ Actually,  there were five, justcwe couldn't see all them:)_ Juan the wind rising or porco rosso are my favs!_ +_ Or the guys that did adventure time_ when i say i would CRY_ @knowun¬† Masaaki Yuasa_ BRO STOP READING MY MIND_ Maybe Miyazaki would come out of retirement for Jacob...?  But maybe not.  He didn't come out of retirement for Ursula K. LeGuin's Earthsea animation, which he had hoped to do for many years after all._ I don‚Äôt know if we are ready for that kind of beauty! ‚ú®_ Yes_ @cu7821¬† JESSSSSS_ a delightful fantasy_ YESSSSS_ Yes!!!_ @shanefiddle¬†he did come out of retirement üéâ, just not for Jacob_ That would be amazing._ That was beautiful üòç_ Love from Algeria Jacobbbbbb <3_ Thank you so much for doing this.  Very personal ... very discreet ... very private ... very inspirational ... touching ... AMAZING!_ The dislikes are from deaf people who are angry because they can't hear Jacob sing_ I'm worried about that he will get back pain because he is sitting like that._ he's extremely pretentious_ Thank you! You're a shining light as always ‚ù§Ô∏è_ I have been waiting for this FOR SO LONG!_ For the people who get overwhelmed by a lot of what Jacob does, or think he makes his music overly complicated in some elitist sense, this is the Jacob Collier you should listen to. Light, calming, and beautiful. It's all in his complex music as well, but if you can't hear it, this is an excellent example._ Thank you so much Jacob. This means a lot to me to be able to relax to your soothing music after a hospital shift._ Oh my God this Danny boy is so damn good_ Missing Jacob‚Äôs would-be concert in seattle_ Thank you.  I Loves your music from Orcas Island Washington üåà‚ô•Ô∏èüïØ_ Lol he looks like a Final Fantasy character in the thumbnail_ That turnaround at 2:38 was incredible..._ watching from Singapore. lovely music, keep sharing!_ This intro could be some mr. Rodgers stuff_ California Here._ God bless you_ That thumbnail was cute tho_ BirkeClara exactly my thoughts üòÖ_ haha his playing and voice are absolutely beautiful but that POSTURE üòÖ_ haha I though the same thing. I have the same exact posture._ I had a friend who was a concert pianist who got into practicing Feldenkreis Technique for body alignment so that he could continue to have a career in a healthy way. I would encourage all musicians too check it out._ Did you see the vid(or maybe community message, cant remember) Jacob posted? I think he said that all the tickets will still be good for a later date. It sucks that a lot of stuff is getting postponed/cancelled, but it looks like Jacob is gonna make sure his fans get some rad performances once all of this blows over!_ I love these stripped down versions of your songs. It‚Äôs like hearing them in their purist form. Your vocalization in the higher registers remind me of the late, great Kenny Rankin. Thank you for sharing your talent with us.  Greetings from Southern California!_ He could be a sesame street character._ He puts notes to his talking. Daym._ Hello my friend from Richmond, VA. Wish I would have caught it live but so blessed to see it regardless. Love what your are doing man._ Amazing!\nWatching from Barbados_ how can he jus talk and play without effort_ I was planning on having this on in the background while I did homework but I ended up needing to keep my full attention on this the whole time_ San Antonio, Texas....... Thanks for doing this for all of us.  Blessings._ Just lovely!_ „Å†üåû„ÅÑüü†„Çπ„Ç≠üåô„Åßüåï„ÅôFromTaipei_ Now this might just be the most beautiful thing I've ever heard! Thanks for blessing our ears Jacob!_ I cant help but feel it would be even more spectacular if he would write and perform a few homely and obscure tunes. With such talent you do not need to try so hard to wow an audience. Just be real._ I think Jacob collier live is one of the most amazing things, his music is incredible but on the records sometimes so much is going on that you can't focus, so these stripped down versions are awesome, they warm your soul_ This is so charming and comfortable, thanks all the way from Paraguay üáµüáæ_ That Last ‚Äûbah‚Äú was a C üòõ_ What talent mixed with love for humanity. You are a gift to the world._ From Ukraine üá∫üá¶ \nJacob is truly  genius )\n33:44 half sharp ?_ 17:43 ‚ö°Ô∏è_ @23:15 id like to see john mayer give this a go_ Admit it, we all needed this_ I agree with you. When i first heard hideaway from him, it instantly reminded me of him. One of the underrated Kenny XD. My childhood flashed right before Jacob._ I think Jacob could probably host the best children's show of his generation._ Ikr! He's inspiring me to learn to play and sing at the same time._ same lol_ sameee_ SAME haha WORTH IT_ I should be doing the school project I need to graduate..._ Yes, he's mesmerising_ Daniel Charles I remember the first time I listened to his music, as well as esperanza spalding, I didn't understand it, but once I took some time to listen to older jazz and work my way forwards to modern day jazz, as well as learn to play in more of a jazz style than my classical brain was used to, I suddenly understood what was so incredible_ I agree. I love listening to him play solo on the piano or guitar because I can actually appreciate the harmonies and the progressions more._ u have to listen a lot to be able to understand it._ listen more. Ur brain has to learn the patterns¬†@kadeandkeys8861_ I enjoyed the \"While The Internet Fixes Itself\" song ;)_ Grammy flexxxx_ Thank you Jacob_ This guy has the ego and talent of Steve Vai._ Jacob: I'm a master procrastinator.\n\nMe:_ It's beautiful thank you from the Nederlands_ That guitar playing was beautiful! And vocals too, I just wish i could come even close! Very nick drake vibes_ Thank you Jacob! I am so happy you played sky above! It's one of my favorite songs to listen to to start the day. Much love from Pennsylvania!_ Slovenia_ 26:02 That harmony though_ Always a special feeling listening to a Jacob Collier song for the first time_ Jacob, thank you, really appreciate this impromptu concert. \nI wish to make an observation. It seems that artists get bored with their own renditions and start introducing flowery trills and impromptu arpeggios into certain parts of a song. Do you think this improves on the core melody? Obviously you do. Not so much for me. Just saying._ I‚Äôm from Finland. Thanks for lovely music‚ù§Ô∏è_ Epic_ Thank you._ Thank you for your wonderful songs and time. Please be careful about COVID-19 and Jacob.\nBy the way, my boyfriend has a bad attitude.\nSo, it will be healed by Jacob's song._ Watching from Lisbon but I‚Äôm from Brasil. More precisely from Salvador - Bahia. I know it is not live anymore but I like to give a shout to my native place._ Beautiful how obsessed he is with music.\n The level of this obsession to profession is what makes a genuous in his industry._ The class this guy has, is totally out of the world! <3_ Please make a virtual duet session with jamie cullum üíõ_ KingGrio Steve Vai is one of his friends. You can see him in several of Jacob‚Äôs music videos (All Night Long, Moon River, etc)_ Yo, I'll high five to that tomorrow._ and he realeased 4 LP at the same time. He dont live in our world_ @fatguy338¬† I liked this comment when I read it yesterday but waited untill today to come back and hit the like button and tell you about it._ exaaactly, wanted to write the same :)_ Paul Clanner my take is that musicians when they play songs live, like to make the songs that all of their fans know feel fresh and not a carbon copy. If they didn‚Äôt do it then no one in the crowd or fans watching afterward wouldn‚Äôt be able to distinguish the live version from a recorded version. (Minus cheering, clapping etc.) Also adding frills and key changes and such is just super fun to play. Nice observation! :)_ He is music_ As a musician myself who is good but definitely not a prodigy, Jacob is just built different. Some people are._ Jacob has that children's tv presenter voice and energy when he chats to the audience here and it's so. soothing_ Hi from Concepcion Chile!  Amazing musician and great voice! I don‚Äôt like so much the falsetto but, the guitar, the piano, the harmonies and your deep voice compensates by far._ Wonderful Jacob! :o)_ This somehow motivates me to practice piano, yet never touch a piano ever again. Mind boggling._ If jacob wants to do a folk album I'm very very here for it_ thank you !_ Really made me cry in California_ Jacob is one of the few people in the world that can say \"Welcome to my humble abode\" and make it sound hip, modern, and the coolest thing anyone has ever said._ Lovely... Thank You...xo Portland, OR_ Thank you from North Carolina!_ Southern Alabama.  And great sounds by the way!_ Falling asleep to this is like a dream. ‚ù§Ô∏è_ Beautiful songs, soulful delivery. I think I‚Äôll have to give Djesse 2 another listen. Wouldn‚Äôt it be great if Jacob could upload a stayathome concert every week!?!_ Jacob is such a consistent source of happiness, positivity, and undeniable talent. Thank you Jacob for taking the time to spread your gift and TED for uploading:) Such a delight every time!_ He's a light in these dark and lonely, boring, uncertain days!_ I get goosebumps whenever I listen..._ I am in Philadelphia, PA and late to the game üòÅ_ The lick at 1:46_ The title of this video says it all - Spectacular, glorious, musical wizardry. Thank you, Jacob!_ Grammy Flex in the back drop._ Salomon Leonard Poutsma imagine if he hosted sesame street_ But in a Bob Ross way_ I had the same thought. Was getting Mr. Rogers vibes._ üòÇ Defo_ A lot of posh people are used to talking to people like they are children. It‚Äôs just all he knows. Not his fault._ @TopLobsters¬† Wow, I've never thought of it this way. I'm not British, but I qualify as posh in more ways than one. I've always had this tendency to talk to people like I'm lecturing kids, but not in a bad way. It's just the way everyone I know talks. It's the same feeling I get from Jacob, I guess. Simplify language to get across the idea. Kinda like the ELI5 philosophy._ He really does exude kindness and compassion._ @Marie Loiseau Appreciate the honesty. The presumption that the people they are speaking to actually need to have the language simplified is part of the problem. Then again, part of it is their own need to feel ‚Äòabove‚Äô others in some subconscious social hierarchy in their own mind. The funny thing is that people see straight through it._ @TopLobsters¬† I don't really think that they \"need\" to get the feeling of being \"above\" others. And I think if his passion is what you see first, then that makes people see straight through it, or rather if you don't see the passion, you see a feel of him wanting to be \"above\" others (because \"acknowledges\" that he is showing his knowledge), so then it's exactly the other way around!\n\n\nPlease don't take this as an attack, but as another way of seeing things!_ Yess! Felt like watching play school lol but for adults_ no hes just pretentious lol_ Jacob Collier, a massive gift to our world üé∂üôèüèº‚ù§Ô∏èüé∂_ Que onda loco, el falsetto es parte del conjunto. Su m√∫sica no ser√≠a la misma sin el falsetto. Si no se traer√≠a a alguna cantante para grabar (que algunas veces hace)... El falsetto se queda. #stayhome._ omg this is exactly how listening to him makes me feel_ Its futile to play anything when you listen to jacob, but then later on you realize ypu can do anything_ I hear you._ he lives in his mother's house in his childhood bedroom._ Edison Wato yet somehow he still pulls it off_ What are you talking about‚Ä¶. He‚Äôs got the vibe of a preschool teacher._ good¬†@edisonwato_ more people should. Our world would be quite a lot beter!¬†@pattymcpattyhaha_ 10:08 if he had gone into Hideaway right there I think I would have had an out of body experience_ Minnesota_ Enjoying this and all of your musical creations very much._ @jacobcollier I‚Äôm so grateful to you for your beautiful and heartfelt music and to TED for featuring such a well deserved musician and ‚Äòcreator‚Äô because that‚Äôs what you do... you create.

Thank you Jacob ‚ô•Ô∏è_ India_ Apparently he did exactly that in a live performance in Mumbai, India_ https://youtu.be/YYW9sF_htU0\n\nAlthough this is so something I found it's any compensation_ AGREED!!!_ From North Carolina, U.

Also he helped work on the Steven universe film and Future series so if you hear a song with a lot of harmonies, this guy probably helped compose it ‚ú®_ I'm watching and listening from my confinement in Switzerland. Thank you for your beautiful music and songs._ The sun is in your eyes\r\n\r\nThrow* me the cold, throw* me the cold cold water of your smile again\r(?)\n\r\nTo take me by surprise, you take me by surprise\r\n\r\nThrow* me the bold, throw me the bold bold treasure of your lips again\r\n\r\nAnd where I go, you lead me in the right direction\r\n\r\nWith your love is my protection\r\n\r\nI'll be world of your projection\r\n\r\nAnd where I go, singing songs of your affection\r\n\r\nWith rhymes to your perfection\r\n\r\nIn my eyes see a reflection of you\r\n\r\nI see you clearly now\r\n\r\nI hold you dearly now\r\n\r\nThe sun is in my eyes_ His music moves you. So much meaning in his vocals. Gradually falling in love :0_ Wow. Really just wow....._ Watching from Denmark!_ I'm quite lucky to have Jacob exist in my era of lifetime.\nPeople in the next generation would be jealous. \nThis guy is a living legend. Please, don't do drugs, Jacob._ Your music is a bless._ Ah i was waiting for this :)_ Tuning in from Armenia! You are so incredible thank u for magical morning! ‚ô•Ô∏èüåª_ I don‚Äôt really listen music but I listened this 2 times_ You're awesome Jacob, I just wish you had better posture._ Melbourne Australia here..You remind me of Nick Drake...Love your music... Bravo.. Peace to the World._ He should have started with the Yamaha 12key challenge üòúüòéüëçüéπ_ Amazing!!_ Jacob, I bought your CD In My Room and enjoy listening to it still. I now use Amazon Music and have found much more to listen to! Keep up the good work! I just listened to you from Groton Connecticut, USA, Cheers!_ he didn't help with either of those but yeah he's great_ Yeah I love Steven Universe and Jacob Collier, but they're not related at all (unfortunately ?)_ Where did you get that from? üòÖ_ as cool as that would be, he's not credited in steven universe anywhere._ we love the spread of false information_ I stand corrected, I was wrong, soz guys üòÇ_ @SimonTheWhale1¬† where'd you even get that false information from?_ ahmad fuad nah just have him do the right ones_ @lukewestondev¬† This, please do drugs, Jacob, the right ones._ Jk, its the same_ He is not that types of guy_ No need to - he IS a drug!_ Jajajajj que deci alto mandibulero el sheico_ @francoagosto2624¬† Por eso est√° re hiperactivo todo el d√≠a, meta papusa el sheico_ ahmad fuad drugs wish they could do Jacob_ @lukewestondev¬† I really don't think he's that kind of type. I mean fame can drive everyone crazy, but i think Jacob Collier is one special human being and way too bright-minded, clever and rational to do it._ music is his drug_ @lukewestondev¬† please do not. I mean it begins always like this.._ https://youtu.be/nOHjhYyCJbE_ He allegedly smokes crack and shoots up amphetamine_ ahmad fuad judging by the videos for a lot of his songs, he's already done shrooms, not to mention how open minded and innovative his music is. I wouldn't be surprised if he used psychedelics from time to time_ MoTo exactly! i love his personality i could listen to him forever, and i literally found him last week and all his vids have been in my recommended_ he probably does._ Drugs are responsible for most good music you ever heard. Drugs and good music are a synergetic._ @whyage3473¬† Bright minded rational people do drugs too._ @SungazerDNB¬† Of course, but not to numb themselves._ I think be gets high on music and his brain is more stimulated by that than any drug could so I think we won't see him do drugs and we be able to appreciate him for many years_ Imagine Jacob on LSD or Adderall üòÇ_ Bro you‚Äôre basically asking him to not be an even better muscian_ @whitest__dad¬† in one of his instagram lives someone asked if he did weed and he said hes never smoked weed so i doubt hes done any drugs_ quite an odd request but a welcome one at that_ @RunescapeWhack¬† HAHHA!  LMFAO  BUT, what about all these peeps worried!_ @Funknfritter¬† Very thoughtful.  Todays musicians can do it at home, with value filled family around them._ Our natural chemistry releases just the right chemicals at just the right time.\nWhen we're \" in the zone\", we feel it.üíûüëç\nWhen we're not, it let's us know... so we can WAKE UP AND LIVE.üíì\n It's perfect inner guidance.üíû‚öñüíó\nLOVE IS THE DRUG‚ù£üíóüé∂ü•∞üíûüòçüé∂üïäüåçüååüíó_ Im 100% certain he does psychedelics and he probably does them a lot. Nice job drinking the war on drugs kool aid tho._ @sosu2441¬† He looks high on coca√Øne to me wright now lol_ @RunescapeWhack¬† lol_ That might damage his intelligence for music_ Not gonna lie you probably have to to be that incredible. He probably has adhd/asd cause your brain doesn‚Äôt work like his if you‚Äôre neurotypical and neurodivergent people often take drugs to manage certain symptoms_ pero, y esa ocurrencia? @ahmad fuad_ Let him do the drugs he wants. They're a part of available (and often valuable) human experiences, no more shameful than any other experience. \n\nI get you probably just mean \"Don't let drugs harm you or take you away from us\" but still. An overwhelming majority of people do some drugs at some point in their life. And I think it's a good thing. Just like other good things, it can easily be a problem, take too much room in your life, hinder your aspirations... But it's not caused by simply taking drugs. It's caused by drug abuse, health problems, addiction. Every human activity comes with risks. It shouldn't come with unnecessary shame._ What an interesting admonition_ New people will come along like him all the time. And most of them will not be on camera._ mfw did drugs ):_ HAHA drugs will really ruin your life. Jacob is pure human and consciousness._ Don't go Jaco on us!_ The only drug he needs is music and other musicians... and probably tea..._ iMusicAcademy üòÇ_ Ayy, what up from New London!_ I am from Thailand_ ü•∞üòçü§© Thank you for this._ Thank you, Jacob.

I'd recommend One Day with Nikki Yanofski if you want a cleaner tracks. Please watch his hideaway video on his YouTube channel, it's a different experience watching him playing all the instruments! His In my Room album is more toned down than the Djesse ones_ Also the song Once You with a feature from his Mom is a beautiful string song!_ @bcan5512¬† thanks for the recommendations, ill check it out_ üòÇüòÇ_ Big ancient soul energy_ but it makes me cry_ Tokyo, Japan ü•∞üëçüáØüáµ_ I wish I could give u a thousandüñí instead of 1üñíüòäthat's amazingüëåüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè_ Tuning in from San Rafael, Marin County, California -- lovely!_ New Zealand.

You should give his Moon River vid a look. Cool visuals and stunning, spacious chords, it's everything you could ask for._ First time as well.

Find something wholesome and beneficial to yourself and others to focus on instead._ Thanks but I‚Äôm gonna listen the whole way through_ @Stephen Docherty What's the weather like way up there on you high horse?_ @Stephen Docherty you really need to work on your trolling. try to make it less obvious that it's bait next time._ Thanks for the time stamps!_ Stephen Docherty it‚Äôs not just about natural raw talent. Jacob Collier worked hard from grass roots up. I saw him perform live recently and he was generous to his fans after the concert. \nI certainly wouldn‚Äôt associate Jacob with narcissism or arrogance. He came across as quite humble and down to earth.\nI knew absolutely nothing about Jacob Collier before the concert and was dragged to the concert by my children. I probably enjoyed the performance more than they did. It was certainly a different musical experience - he also appeared to be enjoying himself onstage with the rest of his musicians and interacting with the audience.\nIn the end the music can be disliked or liked or criticised. I have no issue with that. But I don‚Äôt see where the attack on his character comes from. Sometimes people confuse confidence with arrogance perhaps. Or being comfortable in ones own skin with narcissism. Plenty of political and corporate leaders around the world that can be viewed as narcissistic - and have a public and private record for all to witness._ This thread is a rollercoaster of things and I did not expect it to turn out to be so wholesome. Hope you're okay Stephen bro and it's nice to see everyone responding to his comment in such a civil way instead of pointlessly hating_ He wrote this song about me. That ‚Äòsun‚Äô in my eyes was PTSD, he is a Psychopath type 1 who has been stalking me since march 16th of this year. Everything I search for/all my messages ever received, it‚Äôs all seen and monitored by him. I want him out of my life. He is doing coercive control and is illegal by law in the UK.\nThis song is part of the ‚Äòlovebombing‚Äô phase that psychopaths do. Please get help Jacob, you picked the wrong girl, I will never be silenced. Stop following me, get a life and some professional help. Wishing you the best_ @missellenmartin4152¬† if that is true, you shouldn't comment on these videos. in fact you should not contact your stalker but gather evidence and go to the police._ Stephen Docherty If you read into psychopathy, psychopaths always choose targets, I didn‚Äôt ask for this. I rejected him 4 times and he still couldn‚Äôt accept that fact. Dr ramani has some great videos on youtube on personality disorders. I‚Äôd encourage everyone to check them out. Everyone could be targeted at some point in their lives, if you understand the game a little bit, might save you years from therapy_ God bless all the people who put time stamps in the comment section_ @missellenmartin4152¬† Le troll funny_ I love you, thanks for this_ thank you! :)_ Yup, I talked about this with a musician friend, and I called it \"Morbus Collier\": The feeling of something close to worthlessness in light of a genius.

His maternal grandma is Chinese named Lila Wong.  His mother is half Chinese.  Interestingly Jacob uses his mother‚Äôs last name now.

I would say that restricting the usage of the word not only makes it more powerful but also deepen the division... there are contexts to its usage and it should be handled likewise... tThe world has been through a lot not just african american slavery, brooding over it is like holding onto your depressed past and living the rest of your life in despair... we have learnt the lesson that slavery is f*ed up... but over that incident, just being intolerant and treating oneself exclusive isn't gonna help.... the emotional intelligence is pathetic of yall ..._ My 7th grade social studies teacher had no problem with talking about the N word_ its just a word who cares_ 1 simple question then: Why the word jew is not the j word huh?_ The idea that some people can and other can't use a word is wrong.

Then when someone says you shouldn't do that, they respond, \"Oh, you just want to beat my children, too!\"_ Baning the n word is a poor way to fight racism, in fact it embaces racism. There are fucked up people that are extremely racist yet they dont use the word, does that make them a better person? dont think so_ This is so sad, the racism that goes on in our society both past and present that led to certain words having such a bad stigma is just heart breaking. You know things are bad when someone calls someone else a slur, society can be very hateful at times. D:\n\nIf only the response from this video was extended towards other slur words like the r word and the lesser known slur words that exist. No slur word should ever be used on someone, society and it's past have many scars that can never be healed probably. We all need to accept each other, who cares if someone has a disability or is a race that someone else has. We need to end all the hate people have, the stigma is just too much now._ I find it odd that slurs like the r word and slurs directed towards Chinese and Italians are ok, but the n word is not acceptable. In my opinion, all slurs should be banned from usage, not just the n word. I hear people say the r word all the time, and no one gets mad, yet some psycho says the n word once and now they are canceled everywhere, this is a good thing but it is odd how different slurs bring different reactions.\n\nIf you are one of the few people who don't know what the r or n words are, then I think it is clear you are the patrick star of this society (as in, live under a rock). (Hey, idk comparisons ok)_ It's not hard to talk about it's easy people just choose to be offended lol_ Black people like to use this word even among whites to create an awkward mood and to spook whites. The best thing to do is to just whoop and holler and make jokes and even laugh really  near them. They are race-baiting. Take it from someone who's tried hard to do the well-intentioned white idealist thing; they (in America) don't care. They just want to provoke. Don't give them the satisfaction._ I am from Uruguay. My girlfriend is a Negress from Cartagena de Indias, Colombia and we call each other \"blanquto\" and \"negrita\", which aren't in no way offensive terms. This is definitely an Anglo thing.\nWe live and work in Spain._ The n words only wrong because people give it power non of my black friends get offended_ It's not hard at all for me and my friends to talk about it lol_ Why are they so triggered when we say it. When every person in the room is saying the n word except u cause when u say it it's racist. Or do they feel every race is superior than them when the n word is said by other race._ literally the black people themselves use it commonly possitively, ask them why are they offended then if a white person says it. If anything is racist immediatelly assuming a white person uses it negatively after all this is what trully racist_ This comment‚Ä¶ makes no sense_ ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã¬†@gabby993¬†the n word makes no sense. They throw their stupid slur around thinking that they sound clever and they don't. It was a word used to discriminate them so it don't makes sense for them to turn into a greeting to refer to each other. There is no logic behind the word. Its annoying, its stupid, its immature, its pretentious, its disrespectful to the environment and its time for them to stop thinking its clever. It isn't!_ First step is acknowledging there is a difference in definition between \"n****r\" and \"n***a\".... Never heard the latter used in a racist context, and almost never heard the former used in a non-racist context.  Racist people intending to offend a black person would never say \"n***a\" they would always use the hard-R.  Because we all know there is a difference between calling someone \"n****r\" and saying \"what up my n***a\" or something like that..._ So we are at a point were one half of people with dark skin colour is hurt by the word because of it's historic meaning it carries. The other half uses it as slang in daily talk and Pop culture, so much so that people outside of the U.S. think it has the meaning of bro and similiar words. So you have to sit together and have a talk about it. Either it's the hurtful word that makes people feel discriminated and racistly attacked. Or it's a just a word that can be said and used without being racist and hurtful. Either accept it or make it forbidden for everyone. No grey area and no special rules._ There is no other word that I can think of, that's sole purpose is to disparage an entire race of people.  It's not a word that was used for something else, and then changed to mean this, or some word that was around and ow used because it sounded like something else. This word, was created with one purpose in mind. To hurt, and to cause pain, and to represent all the bad things that racists have  said that people of color are for 400 years. One word to represent all the lies and bullsh*t of another race. It should be forgotten, never passed down to following generations and removed from our collective conscious._ Fear of the n word has made it the best meme of all time_ This is a great talk. This talk could be exactly transferred to an Indian's experience with the P word in Britain. Unfortunately, the P word/racist idea of an Indian's inferiority has never ever been tackled so institutional racism is a massive issue at grassroots, starting in schools. Just like the N word, the P word is \"an assault on []Indian freedom, mobility, and aspiration.\"_ Its just a word that over medicated or under medicated people that want to play the victim get offended by. Same as retarted.. there's no such thing as free speech anymore because if you are not politically correct, use pronouns to identify someone or say your opinion at all. Your racist, offensive, insensitive...etc etc.. so free speech doesn't exist...unless you constantly agree and baby everyone's soft super sensitive ego.. smh.. what a world.. lol_ It really depends on the context it‚Äôs used in. Some people get offended, others don‚Äôt. Most of the time it‚Äôs used in a way not against black people, however some people get the wrong idea. In addition to being a curse word,  this is why it can‚Äôt be said regularly. I don‚Äôt know much about this word so correct me if I‚Äôm wrong._ I'M NOT A FAN OF THE N WORD BUT I OWN THE F WORD. WHAT IF WE CREATIVELY REDIRECTED IT TOWARDS FAT WHITE WOMEN. EVERY TIME A FAT WHITE WOMAN ENTERS A ROOM‚ÄîYOU SCREAM THE  N WORD TO HER FACE. A MANAGER.  THE MORE A MOTHER SAYS DON'T USE A WORD THE MORE THE BOYS WANT TO. PERHAPS YOU SHOULD REDIRECT THE WORD TO PEOPLE THAT CHEAT YOU.  A BLACK PERSON IN AMERICA HAS NEVER CHEATED ME. BUT, EAST INDIANS HAVE. JEWS HAVE.  THE IRISH HAVE.  THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE CHEATED ME HAVE CLEAR TIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. THAT IS WHY A BLACK PERSON HAS NEVER CHEATED ME._ The n.word is fun and cool to say_ There is no such thing as a racist word only racist context_ i realy dont get offended_ What is the N-Word? I forgot, please say the word._ Clap   clap tooooooooo_ TY_ \"N-Word\"? And that is.. that old Germany which tried to conquer the world? So it isn't propriated call it anymore in loud? Sorry my poor english._ I personally feel we should look into the context of the situation and examine the history of  the person who said it before making any judgements , especially if their country is not a part of the west.For example ,over here in India ,black issues and history are hardly discussed.I learnt a bit about the African American slaves in the southern states and the American  civil war and that was all.There is no mention of the nword in our books ,and teachers of history don't teach students that it's an incredibly racist  slur.People don't bother looking into the meaning of words much,and I know a few people who had no idea it was a racial slur ,they thought it meant something along the lines of \"bro\"  .Like just about an year ago,even I didn't know that such a word even existed in the first place,cause I didn't have any access to the internet.Coming to those people,their intentions weren't racist,they were just ignorant and unintentionally used the word after they heard rappers speak it and thought it was a \"swag\" or \"cool\" word.I wish hiphoppers would stop using that word AT ALL that way,cause not everyone studies American history ,and people misinterpret its meaning and use it as a   lighthearted word for their black peers when it is far from being one._ The black community uses this word as commonly as the word \n‚ÄúThe ‚Äú they use it but no one else can .. that‚Äôs just ridiculous!! Grow up and take responsibility for the words black also say in normal conversation!!!_ i dont understand, wich want to speak N_ I CALL FOR THE DESTIGMATIZATION OF THAT WORD~ THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE SHOULD USE IT TO BE MEAN TO BLACK PEOPLE: (or even people in general) BUT I BELIEVE THERE IS A TIME AND A PLACE TO USE IT - FOR EVERY RACE, INCLUDING US WHITE PEOPLE! (I want the days where it's treated like an atomic-bomb to be over as soon as possible, humans should not be scared of something as simple and harmless as words - regardless of how harsh their definitions attached to those words are.)_ innocent comment_ Well, since it's an English language word, and was created by the English, in England for the English speaking people, then it's not really \"your\" word is it.

Always neat to talk to someone from half way across the world about a issue here in America. Get another perspective. It's a word in America that is very charged. Which I get. We held on to slavery the longest of all the western nations. It really was not that long ago. There are still people alive today that can tell you. I remember seeing black only drinking fountains for example. Honestly we are not even that many generations removed from civil war. However. I do think there is some over reaction to it in some ways. Like in this post. I can refer to it as the N-WORD or it. But there is no room for context. If I actually said the actual word, in the context of discussing it's use. I would get the comment flagged by youtube. Some people would jump on here yelling bigot. Because context is not allowed. \n\nBut at same time. It gets used a lot as a positive in the black community as well. Which is weird. Even the confederate flag has this nuts double meaning. It's a racist symbol. Created for the Confederate States Of America. A nation which primarily revolted to preserve the act of slavery as a economic system. But then there is a massive amount of people at the same time. That really see it as southern pride and actually are not racist. Just bought into this messed up idea. The flag is not the same as say the swastika.Which you would likely know about it's origins. I have a Buddha on my leg. Had I had a swastika with that Buddha the context would be positive. But in the west just by it's self. it's negative. But I would never get it added to the tattoo. Because I would have to spend my life defending and explaining it.\n\nLooking at America from a Indian perspective. I'm curios. What do you think of us over here in general. Like the divide over left and right. Trump's reign as president and his desire to take office again? I mean I don't know how close you follow things over here._ innocent reply_ I think this video helped answer a lot of my questions about the word. I can‚Äôt put myself in the position of a black person who hears this word coming from someone who‚Äôs not black whether it‚Äôs in a classroom or in movies or anywhere. The closest I can do is think about LGBT related slurs since I fall in that category but I don‚Äôt really care and I don‚Äôt think it comes as close. But my one question (which I hope I can ask here as we‚Äôve opened a discussion for this) for black people is: if a white person says the n word (whether it‚Äôs as a joke, or they call themself that word in a derogatory way, or they shout it angrily in a video game, or it was in a script of a play or movie) is it forgivable? And this leads more into the idea of cancel culture on social media. I‚Äôm a big fan of gaming youtubers and people continually say ‚Äú___ said the n word one time in a video/stream and they are racist and should be hated for that, and if you like their content you‚Äôre racist too‚Äù. And I just want to know and hear peoples opinions on that. Because if someone said it as a joke or because they are an actor or because they were misinformed or even because a few years ago they were trying to appear as ‚Äúcool‚Äù or ‚Äúedgy‚Äù to the wrong people, is that unforgivable. And this is mostly talking about celebrities and youtubers and stuff but it also comes into play if you heard a friend say it one time by accident or something like that. There‚Äôs a lot of talk about supporting someone who‚Äôs ‚Äúproblematic‚Äù  and this is a thing that comes up a lot so I‚Äôm interested._ She‚Äôs light mocha colored but she says she‚Äôs black. \n\nI am Native American, African American, Irish, English & German, and my skin is a 4 on a scale of 1-10. \n\nI‚Äôm about the same shade as this woman. \n\nBut I‚Äôm ‚Äúwhite‚Äù. Have you ever seen the color white? Yeah.... it‚Äôs not what color I am.  I‚Äôm like a light tan. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nThis has confused me since I was a child._ Had to watch this for class. This is such woke bullshit._ That one white kid in class who goes ‚Äúniiiiii-ncompoop‚Äù or forcing someone to say vinegar. I‚Äôm White and I‚Äôm looking at you._ the fact that we have to talk about the word in this manner means we have already given it too much power. how can we preach for unity and an end to segregation by race when we still hold racial slurs in such high regard?  I am not a racist, i will never use slurs like this in a offensive way intentionally. but seeing us as a species continue to give a word enough power to destroy anything in it's path, be it a friendship, career, or a human life, then we have let that word control us. I believe it should be the other way around, we control the power that words have, and the N word needs to die. The further separation that the N word has caused within our society needs to end. But we as a species cannot let that happen because of what? pride? shame? regret? arrogance? discontent? whatever the reason, it isn't humane, and I will never give that word or any other racial slurs the power that I desperately wish it not to have anymore._ 8th or 9th grade year: we read to kill a mockingbird. If you haven‚Äôt read it, you should. It does use that word so approaching it in the class seemed weird. My teacher decided to have it where if someone was too uncomfortable with hearing the word, she wouldn‚Äôt say it. Everyone was fine, though, and I think it enhanced the book to a new level just from everything that happened in the book. Only book I‚Äôve read with that word. Might be the only one I encounter._ I think I hear more men say that word than women. Was there a time when it was appropriate to say it?_ It's just a word anybody can say it. Not saying it doesn't stop me from having the idea in my head and someone else saying it can't plant the idea if I never had it. And it's not about being inferior it's about behaving like animals._ ?,?????????.???????????_ This is powerful stuff, interesting... in my country many of our people learn racial phrases, by picking it up from older adults or from graffiti, and I've observed that within a race it's often used endearingly and the absolute opposite when between certain races. I guess when used in conversation it's all about how it's thrown out_ Do the opposite, let everyone say it.  Then it will lose all power and meaning.  Many black people have already done this, using the word repeatedly to the point that they aren't bothered by hearing eachother say it anymore.  That's the nature of the evolution of language, words rise and die on their own.  people who cannot control their emotions give the word more power, and getting people to not say it gives the word unlimited power._ Firt of all i heard the (Nword as you say) EVERY DAY ON RADIO BY BLACK PEOPLES!!! So you said is ok if black saying it but not if it's white? So it's depend on skin color? NOW i call that racism!!_ We give the word this much power by calling it 'the N word' that doesn't change that we will still think about it. Censorship just makes it more of an issue. The word makes me uncomfortable and i don't see a reason I'd ever use it as a white male. But i personally do not see how censoring and saying certain races can't use the word changes anything. If anything, saying that just divides us._ I don't think, that rather than using or not using some words, it is more important to understand the meaning and the history connected to it.\nUsing it in historical class does not make you a racist._ What a wonderful presentation, Mrs. Pryor. As a white American, I have learned so much and will carry this as I go on my amrev history studies._ The n word has only been racist since after the American civil war, and even now black people say it a lot so it‚Äôs not really racist. Everyone used to just call people from Africa the n word. The only reason it‚Äôs ‚Äòracist‚Äô now is because racist people will say it in a racist sentence. It‚Äôs just a word and the only way it can be racist is if the sentence is racist. The n word has only taken up its meaning in recent times._ 5:09_ iam not black but since i have dark skin people call me the n word\n i dont even get it_ Americans are weird, never had to address this issue, never had any of those deeper connotations attached to it, yes it is used as a racist term and still is, but when I was growing up and how it was used in my everyday life it was fine, its just a word and only the context in which it is used matters._ points of encounter is like a new trigger warning_ Anything that hurts is wrong._ i have a best friend who is white, and she used to say the N word in joking terms, and once in a derogatory way. she apologized for using it but she did not understand the impact that it had on me and my other black friends, as well as those in the community. we stopped being friends because of it and eventually she educated herself and learned about the history behind it and why she shouldn‚Äôt say it, then we became friends and still have conversations about our current climate in the U.S. this happened years ago, and i think now i have less patience to educate and forgive a white person for saying the word, honestly if i had white friends that said it I‚Äôd most likely just stop talking to them‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs 2022, there‚Äôs no reason to still be uneducated on race issues in America *if you‚Äôre American obviously._ Yes 60's and all before_ How true. I think every ethnicity has its own N-word, however._ @PanAfricanNews¬† indeed. Some words are localized whereas others are more universal which sadly N-word is on the universal end of the scale_ @evolvedcopper2205¬† In South Africa they used to--perhaps still do--use the term \"kaffir.\" I believe the intent behind a word is more important than the word itself. \"A rose is still a rose by any other name.\" Unfortunately, there's a lot of hate in the world, and that's the real problem._ @PanAfricanNews¬† I'm familiar with the word and many slurs from SA, I'm from there. I can confirm the word is still sadly going strong in its use, and with just as much ill intent as it had back then üòî_ @evolvedcopper2205¬† I guess I responded to the right person. I hope everything is going well for you in South Africa. I know the country is going through a lot of challenges these days._ @PanAfricanNews¬† my neighbourhood/township made the international news lately for the worst of reasons. The local news are coming with some inaccurate stuff i hope the rest of the world is taking careful notes of how a country shouldn't be ran. But honestly I'm glad i ran into one intelligent person in this channel's comments for a change. Take it easy Troy ü§ôüèΩ_ @evolvedcopper2205¬† I will. I plan to launch a pan-African news channel on YouTube in January. So, if you hear about it, please take a look, because I've been doing some dry runs for almost a month and have noticed that there is a lot that Africans and the Diaspora need to know about. It was nice corresponding with such a nice person. Take care._ Where's the credit to iDubbbz?_ It's so good - to have a power over others. Woke SJWs use this \"N-word\" to police the speech of others. Freedom of speech - give me a brake! You have nothing to do with preserving this marvelous freedom, you just want the power to dismiss any person, that's it. And all this eye-watered speech - so pathetic, so hypocritical!_ how about nobody says it, then we dont have to dance around or w/e and everyone can move tf on with our lives and stop crying abt slavery that most ppl never even experienced._ Great content..._ Would it be easier to talk about the K-word used for Jews?_ \"Fear of the name [or word[ only increases the fear of the thing itself.\" - Hermione Granger_ insert idubbz video_ As a european this was a really confusing non relatable roller coaster of emotions._ The problem is not the word.\nThe problem is the racism.\nUnfortunately removing the word will not help with removing the racism._ By compartmentalizing any word, you reduce the ability to decompress its strength. The study of linguistics covers the fluid and very social evolution of words in common usage. By attempting to time stamp and rigidify its meaning, you laden it with a supernatural and subjective weight. Pre-loading it with an undue psychological weight instils an increase in potency of which it is undeserving. Black people are not 'less', or powerless. No term or flawed perspective can change that. We can not rise with an anchor._ How about people who aren‚Äôt the majority percent of black just not say the N-word. Why do you guys wanna say it sooo bad. It‚Äôs just 1 word that you are told not to say._ Ok I agree with most things you say, yet black people call each other it all the time_ So sad_ But it was a joke. I don't understand how you expect to teach American history if you can't deal with words that aren't even directed at you. I also don't agree with the decision to completely disallow use if the word instead of explaining to them what the word has been used for and why it probably shouldn't be used in polite conversation._ Did I just watch 20 minutes about a word? Dont get me wrong, I do believe she and most US citizens feel how loaded the word is. I believe the struggle. But all this GIVES the word power. It is only a word and from the bottom up, it will be used a lot out of lack  (i.e) of education or just out of spite (in music, in the streets, by racists...). So be it: let it be, unload it. The educated ones can not prohibit it, the uneducated ones see it as a shiny weapon... Let it be. It is useless. Talk about it, teach it, learn from it, but unload it. Take its power away, dont add to it..._ Freedom of speech should be carried on shoulders of responsibility and not on ignorance to history, emotions, feelings and overall humanity.\nIts like when everybody is allowed to own a weapon that doesnt mean everyone has to use it. You should know the responsibility. So with words they can hurt too.\nMore and more people using freedom of speech as a justification for their carelessly which is the wrong way._ I don't like the idea of black people being allowed to say it and others aren't. I have no problem with it but I can understand why people have and I myself would never even have the idea of using it in any situation besides education/when I can not avoid it, because I refuse to say ‚ÄúN word‚Äú. My problem is when people use the word because they are black and are allowed to because of this and then have a problem when someone not black says it. It is racist to forbid it because of skincolor. Nobody says it or we all can. Everything else is just not fair._ Maybe because I am not familiar with american culture, but even after listening to the whole video, I don't understand why a single word can bring down not just a person, but according to her anecdotal evidence, everyone. Why ascribe so much power to a word like that. Also I wonder why she came to the conclusion that censorship is the only viable solution to the problem. I just don't understand what's going on over there._ I didn‚Äôt know the word cause all this emotions in the African American community.\nI use it in my childhood several times to call my sister and was a simple nickname she never complain about it.\nAs a migrant yes I have seen racist comments now and then but never carry on to make scars to the extend to be hurt or offensive if someone say that word.\nNow I begin to understand for Americans represent big part of history nor to be proud of it._ Is that the n-word_ This was very powerful to watch. I have huge respect for Dr Pryor!_ What's the point of making a word just to say that NOBODY can say it?_ I agree. The N-word seems to be collective baggage._ You are one very well spoken individual_ this is a lot if word salad just to say what you are saying, it makes sense but some of these words look like you threw them in to sound intellectual but the last part was simplified and that contrast is the problem_ The Niger River and the region around it have a rich history, with various ethnic groups such as the Hausa, Songhai, and Tuareg. The name ‚ÄúNiger‚Äù itself comes from the Tamashek phrase ‚Äúgher n-gheren,‚Äù meaning \"river among rivers\"\nThe Nile River, on the other hand, is associated with the Nilotic peoples, who inhabit regions along the Nile in countries like Sudan, South Sudan, and Egypt, which was then attributed to the people, NILE RIVER GHER PEOPLE , creating the word niger from latin meaning black and then black people took the n word that people used as derogatory and attributed the word NEGUS which is black royalty in regions of africa. i wish everyone took the time to do due diligence research and not just say stuff without proper info_ @jaazielolayinka6865¬† could you explain for me pls I want to understand_ Good point._ Why do we brood this lot on morality? I would say that restricting the usage of the word not only makes it more powerful but also deepen the division... there are contexts to its usage and it should be handled likewise... tThe world has been through a lot not just african american slavery, brooding over it is like holding onto your depressed past and living the rest of your life in despair... we have learnt the lesson that slavery is f*ed up... but over that incident, just being intolerant and treating oneself exclusive isn't gonna help.... the emotional intelligence is pathetic of yall ..._ Totally agree with u_ Ya. Like your above post. You had to say the N-Word. Instead of the actual word. Because context in not taken into consideration. You were not using it as a slur. Just speaking about the use of the word. I would of just preferred to say the actual word. But then my comment gets flagged as racist. Because context is not part of the discussion anymore._ The N-word comes from Portuguese and Spanish but the meaning of it changed over time._ I love how she didn‚Äôt even bat an eye when the girl said the Chinese slur, but is still shaken over the African-American slur. Either they‚Äôre all okay, or none of them are._ What should happen to the word?_ The power of letting go._ this all sounds like old age talk. No one I know IRL or online is genuinely offended by the word, and I'm talking hundreds. We make fun of the word to make it lose power and its working._ You're not even black._ Turkish plsss_ This was very helpful. Thank you._ Human emotions, blugh._ As a person from another culture listening till the end of the video, I am not 100% sure what the N-word is. I am 95% sure. This speech inviting not to use the word, awakens in me curiosity to really here this word said. With this speech the word that presumably needs to be suppressed, is given more prominence instead.  Will it do any good if not using the word will leave more people ignorant about the racist problems of the past?_ I didn't know about N-words. I'm afraid the Japanese would say them lightly because of ignorant._ Racism fatigue. I‚Äôm tired of hearing about racism. We all have problems. We all have people who hate us. We all have people who ruin our careers and relationships. It isn‚Äôt a black thing. Move on._ This was informative and thought-provoking. And the large number of thumbs down on the video are evidence that racism is still a huge problem. I would love to hear a non-racist criticism of this talk._ Interesting this surfaced after a NASCAR driver - of Japanese-American descent - casually used it over a live feed when he didn't know everyone was listening.  It's cost him his job, his sponsorship contracts and certain any respect anybody had for his ability.  If he had watched this, maybe he would have had a better understand that using that language, even casually, is and never has been acceptable.  There are a lot of terms that are used for some behaviors that have a racist base.  May we all one day grow to be better people and get beyond it._ I hear it almost daily not with the hard \"R\" as black men also some mexican men talk back an forth togeather when playing blackjack.  What should I say or do as a white man dealing the game. When seeing other people being affected at the table including men an women of all ages an races when they say it so loud an proud, I am at a loss of what to do._ Racism been around forever and will continue to stick around. It‚Äôs Nothing new, just have to get used to it because it‚Äôs not going anywhere_ It hardly seems like the perfect endgame of humanity for us to be afraid of saying words and expressing the wrong frequencies from our faces. Cosmically silly, we will surely eventually get over this??_ When Black Americans stop sing the N word towards each other, I will be able to take this kind of lecture more seriously._ I have no ambition to use the ‚ÄúN‚Äù word anymore as I would the ‚ÄúC‚Äù word._ What a horseshit TED-topic.  It's snowflakes like this (Elizabeth Stodeur) - who need 'safe spaces' from words - that ABSOLUTELY increases the power of the word:  rhymes with 'digger' (rhyming because the SJWs at youtube will erase the real word and the comment that encapsulates it).  While words like 'cracker' and 'gook' are certainly disparaging, at no time do I ever want to see them become 'unspeakable' - because it's just insanely juvenile to have such a mindset and ultimately counterproductive to stoping the motivation to use such words._ If all people are equal, then why some can say certain things, but others can't? Aren't some people more \"equal\" then others in this case? Isn't it some sort of elitism? A way to separate \"your\" group from everyone else? I could never understand, how words can agitate people so much. I always thought that actions are what really matters, not words._ None of them are okay. But if we censored all slurs people would claim that it's iMpiNGiNg mY fReEdOm oF sPeEcH and would demand that they be allowed to use them._ Adam Craig¬† No I'm mocking people who think they're oppressed because they get criticised for using slurs_ @Joost Broek The N word isn't illegal though?

It's possible.. plus why the word hurts a black person can definitely still teach you that other racial slurs exists._ maybe its because they don't understand the history_ History is history its the past. Blacks now adays arnt slaves. They know the history, but they know that there no reason to fear the word anymore cause no one takes it seriously because theres literally no reason to take it seriously anymore._ @FlareSnare¬† I think your generalising alot, as a black young female no one really explains what the word is so you have to find out for yourself and it doesn't help if your being called that word at the time because at that point it's just a word thats used against you. would love to know whether you are black or not because i havent checked the above comments and whether you stated that you were black or not_ Knowing the origin of the word will help people to not be emotional about it._ Wikipedia has a decent explanation.  A search for \"what is the n word\" will (currently) produce that page as one of the results._ It can be lessened. If the majority of a population is comfortable saying that racism is bad that's already one hurdle done. There are cultures that don't even accept that they are racist and thus don't think they are doing anything wrong. If we acknowledge that it is morally wrong to be racist, it gives us a moment to think about our prejudices._ Prescient observation. One way or another, we will get over it._ Scott Brimhall you cant group a whole race together, this statement is just like saying ‚Äúwhen white people stop using the word against black people I‚Äôll let them voice their opinion on it‚Äù_ a word cannot be expelled from the world. we will never get rid of the word. take the lecture seriously now because the word will be forever used, by black people or not_ It's the action that stemmed from the word, you have to think back to the far past where they weren't just saying it buy itself at first.\nThen as slavery was abolished, it was used as a mental or psychological thing to break those of color.\nHave you not ever been called something that you thought was hurtful by someone you care about? Whether it be your mum, sister, brother, significant other etc?_ The Niger River and the region around it have a rich history, with various ethnic groups such as the Hausa, Songhai, and Tuareg.

The more taboo you make it, the more powerful it becomes.  Her dad (Richard Pryor) knew this, and that is why he said it in every other sentence during his comedy._ I grew up going to a school starting in 1992 with a diverse class, in Texas of all places and we seemed to have been spared of picking up racist habits. We embraced each other. I thought the whole world was like this.. and then I moved to Portland, Oregon and I witnessed how badly black people were treated. Same when I moved to SoCal. Then I moved back to Texas as an adult and was having a great time with my grandmother listening to old music made by black artists, and she said \"that **** music is good isn't it?\" \n\nThe whole mood changed. I felt like I was witnessing something special, that in a state full of racism that I was lucky enough to never witness.. my own grandmother is perpetuating it. It was there all along, I just wasn't seeing it or hearing it. Now I'm in Connecticut and my mother in law has a dashcam video saying someone was being suspicious on her property. I watched the video.. it was just a black man on his cell phone on the sidewalk. \n\nI'm only white, and I can't imagine what it is like for black people. I wish I could have a conversation with them about it or apologize for others but I don't even know how to approach it. I'm on their side. All I can do sometimes is encourage the good behavior and lead by example but it feels like it should be more._ it will only pack a stronger punch if you tie the word too closely to an unhealed wound.  free yourself of the pain, people. just remember that no one in their right mind will call you names, period._ ‚ÄúThe greatest thinkers in the world ‚Äú -Ted_ Grow up. It's a word.  Problem solved._ Your entire talk was terribly stupid and dangerous._ If blacks continue to call each other the N word constantly, don't expect it to go away in our society anytime soon.  Also, I always find it interesting that light-skinned blacks think far less of dark skinned blacks.  Bizarre, don't you think?_ I think this is an important talk. I don't think we should have a debate about whether or not ANYONE can say it in public discourse, that feels like a hard pass for all the reasons Pryor outlines, but if you cannot say it in the context of history, historical texts or popular culture how can you teach it? How can you teach students (of all races) to think about it and to fully understand it and ultimately move away from it if we just pretend it does not (still very much) exist? If, as Pryor says, we skirt over it and make it as tantalising as a basic swear word? Surely, by that reasoning the ONLY space it should be acceptable to say it IS in the context of academia._ Ironic, the title has the 'N-word'_ FREE N-WORD PASS!!!!_ When I was small, my immigrant Italian grandparents made it very clear that we were never to utter the word Dego. For those too young, it's the derogatory rascist slang for Italians. Was also a popular Polish slang in 60's, 70's, often used when telling insulting jokes. Fortunately nobody came up with the \"D\" or \"P\" word. Maybe people will not debate so much by the next generation, as usage significantly declines, let's hope \"N\" word will become archaic as others._ The N word has to do with  American  history.  To say  Negro in Europe is not tabu. The  N word is a smoke screen for historic Reality.  I am Negro and I am proud  of it. üá©üá∞_ I think the people who are using this word the most are black people, arent they? At least I feel like this is the case._ As an Australian, this word is less common in my culture but (obviously) racism takes other forms. However, whenever we came across the word in To Kill a Mockingbird, my English teacher told us that he wasn't going to say it and explained the reasoning behind his choice (he also taught history, so he knew what he was talking about). I think this could be a more appropriate was of approaching the n-word in classrooms._ Democrats are the ones who give that word power...._ So by not saying the word and referring to it only as, ‚Äòthe N word‚Äô what you‚Äôre effectively doing is making US say it in our heads. If you‚Äôre going to discuss this topic, grow a spine and say the word. Or don‚Äôt talk about it at all üôÑ.

Towards the end of his career, Richard Pryor said he would stop using the H-word, which he used a lot in his stand-ups, out of respect for his white wife._ The Original Gamer Depression.

It used to be a slur and when people stopped using it as a slur it became a non-offensive colloquial term._ Good point. I remember back in the '80s, a much older coworker, Pete Sesti, who affectionately called himself that when he got mad one time. He said nobody was going to mess with him._ Good point, make a word used so little that it no longer becomes bad.\n\nI still find it odd how people don't like the n word yet happily say the r word even though it is also a bad slur. Words and their meanings hold a lot of power, sometimes that power in words is good but other times it is not. D:_ Nope. I tried, but I can't take this seriously. Made it to 5 minutes, though, so I think I did a good job._ So what? Blacks say it all the time. Besides the proper word to say is Negro._ Yet it is is sooo many songs so okay to profit of it, call each other it?? Hypocritical standards.  Either stop using it all together or suck it up._ Kyle Larson_ Doesn't she have the n-word pass?_ As an East Asian, I can never comprehend the fear of the N-word.\n\nWe are technically all Chinese descent, with our ancestors moving from mainland China in different points of the 5000-year history.\n\nAnd throughout Chinese history, a mass majority of the people were slaves.\n\nAlso, a lot of us Asians believe that White people are the superior race.  Just look at where Asians migrate to and you can see proof.\n\nTherefore, we don't feel that strongly about racism.  We are racist against ourselves, and we agree with it.\n\nI guess the only difference here is that we were not enslaved by a different race.  We were enslaved by our own people._ I think in the classroom it should be allowed when directly referencing it (like reading from a text). Maybe not every day or excessively. But I think everyone should say it at least once. Then after that section is over, show them all a video of a black person's reaction to being called it (both in memories and directly). That way they learn about the horrors of our past without hiding it, but they also see the pain that word STILL holds so they understand that it isn't just in the past.\n\nBecause I can't think of a single soul who can watch dozens of people of all ages cry from a single word or explain their pain and anger and still want to use it or think it is appropriate to use._ Was the N word derived in any way from the word Nigeria, since that‚Äôs where many enslaved people came from?_ Should have incorporated the word (or perhaps even the meaning of the word) \"intention\" into this, then maybe it wouldn't be such a load of self important bollox._ examine many lauguages, and tell me the word for the color black. dont focus on the word, focus on the intention.\n\nmy mother should not have to panic when speaking spanish out loud to her coworker in a hardware store and referring to a colour of something they need._ So terrified of a word that she's visibly shaking; what a sad joke.

Just don't use the N word, the F word, the R word, the D word, the H word, the G word, or the C word. No matter the context, intention, or meaning. If you are part of a specific group then you have you have my permission. Otherwise you are racist, sexist, or homophobe and you must be punished. < This logic is stupid and all it does is either promote censorship or promote discrimination._ I could see this video blowing up_ What word is she talking about?_ I think a good teaching tool would be to watch the skit by Dave Chapelle  where he is a black KKK member.

That'd be a lovely day._ I have mixed feelings, and am less educated in history than I like. Some (not all) black friends of mine use \"n***a\" often and casually. After asking about the minor difference of \"-a\" and \"-er\", I learned that it wasn't as important as the color of the skin of the person speaking the word. I actually said the word in asking the question, and the room silenced. I believe I was the only white person in the room (about 15 people, total). When anyone else in the room used the word - or any of a few modifications - it was received quite differently. I want to understand. After learning a little more about such history, I sometimes start to feel ashamed of my skin color. Cultural backlash? I want to say that it is just a word, and that we are all humans, with a beautiful spectrum of shapes, colors, sounds (languages), but it certainly isn't that simple. I suppose many of us desire simple solutions. Maybe that's lazy.\n\nIn our country's (USA) past, many people were proud to be white, or ashamed to be black. Today, it seems the reverse is sometimes happening. I wish we could be proud or ashamed, not of how we look, but of who we are. Some people are good, and some are not, regardless of their genetics.\n\nIt has been a few years, but I read Black Like Me (John Howard Griffin), and definitely recommend it.\nI am eager to converse with anyone who can help me learn more._ Black \"intellectual\" Ta-Nehisi Coates_ I remember reading To Kill a Mockingbird out loud in class and our teacher told us to read the word out loud. It showed up in a chunk I was supposed to read and I felt uncomfortable so I skipped over it. The teacher told us to read it, but I knew that something about it was wrong, even though I didn't know the history. \n\nAlso, my dudes, what is up with this like to dislike ratio?_ It depends on one's neurological associative condition of injury with the sound/word. Some of us feel similarly with the sound/word, stupid, fat, dumb, etc. We all have some neurosis._ Well her point was that hearing that specific word is the part that makes all the feelings boil to the surface with black people. You can see her strugling to even think about what it means to her. She just doesn't want her and  other black people to experience that, so she refrains from it entirely I think?_ @benverzijlbergen2968¬† You mean the implications to herself and fellow black people? It seems that it would be a problem only within her community that probably still encounters literal racial abuse, with active racial encounters, and that to me, I think, would make it perfectly fine for her to discuss it. Some people just detach the historical implication and treat it as it is, as a word._ niccolom ‚Äúwe were enslaved by our own people‚Äù so were people of African descent, initially and now._ It is understandable that not everyone has a complete comprehension of how someone else is feeling in certain situations. I mean, I think about the thing you mentioned the same way you do.\n\nBut we could imagine: What if there was a word that would upset you greatly, a word that makes your blood boil, your tears flow and your stomach churn.. How would you feel if some people casually use it, making you go through those unsettling emotions every time? Would it be wrong to ask them to take your feelings into account? I'm interested in hearing your thoughts about that._ I don't think there's a fear of the N-word, just emotions because of not knowing its origin and subsequent negative history. The words one chooses matter._ I‚Äôm a southeastern asian and we‚Äôre racist towards Cambodian (I‚Äôm Vietnamese and Cambodian) so as a very young age I understand how hurtful racism can be. My grandfather act like they‚Äôre dirty and disguising, and then he compared it to me._ @cyberyoutabe5995¬† \nMy comment was from 2 years ago, and a lot of things have changed since then.\n\nOne thing that popped up several months ago, was about how there is a \"ladder of racial discrimination\" amongst Asians.  Somewhere there is a tacit understanding among different Asian races that there's a hierarchy of superiority among all the races in the world._ Are you familliar with rap music?_ Obviously, you are not a teacher_ this is the worst possible idea. as a BLACK woman who grew up in a predominantly white school system‚Ä¶ i was incredibly uncomfortable hearing students say the N word, but ESPECIALLY when teachers used it, even in a historical context. I could not imagine how unbearable it would be to hear your classmates say the N word just to ‚Äúget it out once‚Äù._ I honestly think it should die. If all of our generation agree racism = bad and media stopped using it, it‚Äôll die down. If_ No._ Both are derrived from the word black. One meaning a black person, the other meaning the country of black people. I'm pretty sure the locals used to call it something else before the europeans tagged it as such. Don't quote me on that though üòÖ_ Good point. Though it seems that only one particular iteration of the word seems to be the ussue, and I believe spanish makes it a 5-letter one when used as an adjective? So she should be good. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, I did not study spanish ^.^'_ It's about context too though. Most reasonable people would realise that variations of negro are prevalent in many European languages_ Yeah but that's the thing, because the Americans back then, all they knew how to do was take, take, take. Whether it was languages or people. But it it's your mother tongue it shouldn't be a problem. It would be obvious by your mother's accent that she's Latina yeah? Unless she encounters those of color that're uneducated._ You are correct. Why is it the only slur that is taboo?... Yet, THEY are allowed to call each other it?.. Make up your mind..._ Please, what are those words?_ Knowing the origin of the N-word would also shed light on this controversial subject._ I‚Äôm a black man, grew up thinking if a white person was to say that word they are racist and I needed to put them in check. Only because that‚Äôs what I saw other black people around me doing when it happened. I think a lot of us are just following suit and not really questioning anything. This word will always be around and every person regardless of color or background has access to it. If we would accept that instead of having an emotional response each time maybe we could come to understand eachother a little better. I encourage everyone to use the word and every other word that offends us. Right now society seems to have a really low tolerance for it but that doesn‚Äôt give them the right to assault you because you‚Äôre exercising your freedom of speech._ @silent_jav¬† \nFreedom of speech seems to be a privilege we probably take for granted when we grow up with it. With that privilege, however, comes responsibly - right? Words can be very hurtful when assembled in certain ways, used by certain people, and directed at (or received by) certain other people. How might we marshal this privilege to prevent it from being used to abuse and harass others? I suppose that question does not have a simple answer.\n\nWhy are some people so cruel and vindictive? I have so many frustrating questions like this, but perhaps contemplating such existential questions is a poor use of time. Maybe there are better - more useful - questions. For example, instead of asking for a reason for the existence of bad people, perhaps a better question for me to ponder might be something like this:\n\nWhen I encounter people who speak and behave in cruel and vindictive manners, how can I better understand these types of people, and respond in a way that will educate them (and others)?\n\nThat type of question certainly seems less satisfying to me - at least immediately - but education can be extremely powerful. Unfortunately, however, education cannot be forced, and when accepted, such education can often require uncomfortable amounts of time and effort.\n\nAn uncomfortable realization I often have is that the easiest person for me to educate is probably myself. That seems like a dichotomy, to educate one's self, but what I really mean by that is seeking out quality education, and investing time and effort in pursuit of it. With such knowledge (acquired by many people), I hope and believe that truth and justice have a chance to prevail over greed and hatred.\n\nWhere do I find such quality education? Certainly not by simply Googling my questions, as the internet, while full of useful information from great sources, is also teaming with poor information from far less reputable sources. Many of these poor sources are purposefully misleading people, while many other poor sources just don't know how poor their information is. I don't know what all of the different motivators are for these sites of poor information, but I suspect that at the top of such a list of motivators are money and power (feeding greed and hatred).\n\nHow do we find people who are not corrupted by desires for power and/or money? I believe the internet is a powerful tool to aid in such a search, but navigating through misinformation can be tedious and overwhelming. Do you (or does anyone) have any thoughts and/or suggestions regarding any of these thoughts?_ First of all thank you for even watching the video to learn more about the topic. I think wanting to learn more is great because the sad reality is that most of us don‚Äôt learn this stuff at schools. You can ask questions about the history and discrimination without using the word. As she explained in the video, it‚Äôs more then just a word. I don‚Äôt think you shoud feel ashamed of your skin color, but i don‚Äôt believe you can be proud. Especially if you have never been treated, looked at, spoken to as lesser than someone else simply because of the color of your skin. Instead be an allay help spread the word, spread awareness like share this video, talk about it to your surroundings,.. it can do so much. Do not underestimate the power that you have especially being a white man. Talking about your privilege and realizing this can do so much. Talking about race and acknowledge your privilege will make people of color more comfortable around you. Because of this they will be more open about their struggles regarding race. There are great sources everywhere regarding this topic, you just have to want to learn. So again thank you for wanting to learn. I really hope you don‚Äôt start or are using the word, because as she explained so well it‚Äôs more than just a word._ @ng6659¬† There are other forms of discrimination too. Even though people may not discriminate over his skin color it could be over political or religious beliefs. And while it‚Äôs ok that you and her both believe the N word is more than just a word I just want to remind you that you do have a choice. If you wanted to you could look at the N word as just a word but I think you are focusing on the history behind it and thinking of the times you were discriminated against when it is used. There will always be racist, sexist, and all other kinds of people in this world. We‚Äôre no better than them at the end of the day they‚Äôre human. If we could learn to accept even the ones that are against us and understand that they don‚Äôt know a better way, then we would be one step closer to world peace. It doesn‚Äôt have to be us against them. Even if they see it that way._ @Harshita Raut the word has racist roots but it‚Äôs also closely affiliated with hip hop/ rap and black culture. In no circumstance do most black people find it ok for other races to use the word. There‚Äôs even some black people who think that we shouldn‚Äôt be using it. In my opinion each and every one of us would benefit from seeing through these words._ @Harshita Raut The N word pass has always been a joke. If you are any color other than black you will have problems using that word around other black people. There is the rare exception where you are raised in a black community and are accepted by the ones in that community but the black people outside of that community will have major issues with you using that word. The word is an instant trigger for a lot of us and even though you may have had good intentions most black people aren‚Äôt going to understand that and won‚Äôt see past the fact that you used a word they said you ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt‚Äù._ @Harshita Raut yeah, to some of us both are equally bad but ‚Äúer‚Äù was what whites called the black slaves so it hits a lot harder for some especially if it‚Äôs coming out of a white persons mouth. ‚Äúa‚Äù was what black people turned the word into and used it amongst eachother. In todays climate even people who aren‚Äôt black can take offense to the word. It‚Äôs ridiculous lol_ Yes I agree, the terrible things done in the past has led to the n word existing and the meaning it has when spoken and heard.\n\nIt seems like racism persists through time because of this word, I've also witnessed the different reactions when someone and someone else says the world. One race can say this slur but the other races can't? In my opinion, no one should be able to say slurs, slurs are not good and should never be used in direct situations like these. I also am confused at how slurs like the n word are unacceptable, yet other slurs like the r word are accepted by general society. No slurs should be used, not just the n word but all slurs. It seems like how and by whom words can be used is also racist, though someone more formal will be needed in order to conclude if this is true or not.\n\nWhy can't we as humans just accept each other? Is it really so hard to be nice to each other for once????? I've also witnessed what I can only describe as \"Reverse racism as we know it\", although it is still racism because racism is not just white people being mean to black people, racism is someone from one race being mean to someone from another race because they are in that race. Racism as we know it and is most common in this day and age might end, but unfortunately racism will still persist in other forms, in other ways, and from other people towards other people. We as a society need to improve and actually rid all racism._ You choose to FORGET HISTORY then you're doom to repeat it. The N word is disrespectful for a reason._ The Niger River and the region around it have a rich history, with various ethnic groups such as the Hausa, Songhai, and Tuareg. The name ‚ÄúNiger‚Äù itself comes from the Tamashek phrase ‚Äúgher n-gheren,‚Äù meaning \"river among rivers\"\nThe Nile River, on the other hand, is associated with the Nilotic peoples, who inhabit regions along the Nile in countries like Sudan, South Sudan, and Egypt, which was then attributed to the people, NILE RIVER GHER PEOPLE , creating the word niger from latin meaning black and then black people took the n word that people used as derogatory and attributed the word NEGUS which is black royalty in regions of africa. i wish everyone took the time to do due diligence research and not just say stuff without proper info_ @conquistador497¬† \nThank you for that information.  I am lazy, and in that spirit, I ask the following question.  Can you offer me any sources/links to learn more - and share with others?_ @ all you have to do is look up african history of the ppl and the regions, im african but an american citizen with african parents but african history is suppressed and even my parents arent taught what some Americans are taught about history or the world in general. i basically looked up what everything was called before european influence and went down a rabbit hole of african dialects and languages like europeans and everyone else does with european stuff since everything is kinda whitewashed or destroyed if not(the Spinx of egypt, aztec and mayan empire writings and tech, good and minerals and what they were used for,etc.) im also a big history buff and like to know what i talk about as a black person before i talk since im more likely to be discredited and bashed than most others_ Black people are so good when it comes to intellect_ Thank you for your thoughtful critique and discussion. If only more people would be as circumspect in their language and attitudes. Words have power, always have, always will. That's why we've needed to create them to be able to communicate. The use of the N-word says just as much about the user as the recipient. Bravo!_ That section with the person who didn't care that others were called the nword and later was said to come in crying \"She thought she was immune she realized that she wasnt\", should be more like, \"She thought she was immune\",  We convinced her otherwise. A person who was not affected by something until you made them affected by it by making it a big deal._ Finally The Ted talk we all wanted_ So, can i say it or not?_ I thought this would be interesting, but I hate how she's still not fully analyzing the entire thing. There are two entirely different versions of the word, and that needs to be addressed. Those two words are not the same thing, and when people say only African Americans should use it, we're not talking about the ancient racist one._ Sticks and stones..._ It is always fun to see how americans are hurting themselfs in their confusion... It is a part of your history, a pretty grimson one, for sure. But by making it a forbidden word, you are making it fun to say, in most cases not to hurt, but just to get a reaction. Thats that simple. People don't care about your problems, your feelings or your ancestoral pain. They don't bother about the \"power of words\". The only thing you are achiving is giving people another point of attack. The only way to stop this N-word is to stop giving any reaction to it and to stop using it yourself. Going all PC and woke, trying to shame and/or attack people who use this word will bring only more hate. And this \"education\" about the \"true meaning\" helps hateful people to use it in a more hurtful way._ Didn't know this is still a big thing to have people that feel even an urge to talk about this.._ We are the knights who can't say \"NI\"._ MRS OBAMA GET DOWN_ Oh noes! Save us from the harmful words! \nLike the song from DBA - Peace of Mind says, \"You will not achieve peace of mind, if you don't leave the past behind.\" But of course you will never do that, you literally make your living bringing up the past and pushing it in the face of minorities and deliberately causing strife and racial animosity. You are a race baiter, someone determined to keep the minds of minorities on the leftist plantation._ I believe that no word should be blacklisted. I believe that blacklisting any word accomplishes nothing. I believe that there are many words which are offensive to many different groups of people. None of them should be used to offend those groups of people. But blacklisting any word accomplishes nothing. All words are just words. I do not believe that this word is any worse than all the other offensive words humans have created. Those who feel it necessary to ban any given word are snowflakes. I agree with George Carlin that it is not the word that is the problem, but the person who uses the word with malicious intent._ why a load of crap..its just a black using the climate to push the fact that she is black.._ Just because you have a Black Mother.. Doesn't mean that your White father can not be in your conversation. \nAnd if your Black, does this mean you are not brown? Because i look white but im really Yellow._ Jeez I like going to Nando‚Äôs_ Unlike others, only Americans use terms like \"African American, Asian American, Latin American, etc\" when there's should only be two terms used: American and Non-American. Just why._ racism is rising again thanks to the democratic party & CNN that is calling it up day after day. I even read a article from CNN that white robots are racist.._ Theirs always going to be racist people get over it! Who gives a damn better things to think about.._ Why white people want to say it so bad?\nIf you know that you will offend people why do you want to say it?_ telling an oppressed person not to say something isn't fair... asking your oppressor and his relatives who still benefit from his oppressive ways not to use a word that offends you when said by them is asking you to be sensitive to the pain it causes. This isn't an issue of fairness. Its an issue of understanding. Sadly you and others have yet to understand._ Yes. A person's intentions mean everything when it comes to speech._ But words..._ are often used to intentionally harm people as well..._ ikr, the whole talk is cringe af_ @roye6961¬† not saying it is cringe but I am saying I am quite surprised that society hasn't come to a state, where they understand that this word is just a weapon against society itself..\nI am saying just let it be\nThere has to education about this. But the education has to go to the point where everyone understands that this has to be a relic of the past.\nI don't like it to be used as cool fashion word and I say this as a white person_ Now you know_ @ElNegringoKreyolito¬† of course I knew before. I mean I am sad and I know humans can perform better, that's my main point_ @gsftb¬† No they can't unless they're kids. Because then you're pure, and not shaped my society and its rules and judgmental sharks like adults. Adults is what started this, and they cant even finnish it because of their hatred for each other._ Is this the Jewish comment section?_ @macktheripper7454¬† I don't follow your meaning. It was a reference to the \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\" movie._ @macktheripper7454¬† https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e2kaQqxmQ0_ @macktheripper7454¬† \nWhat exactly do you mean?_ Lmao love that movie_ Mike theJedi eh?_ NI_ But we can definitely say Ekki ekki pfhang thong_ @jax2728¬† Do you still demand a shrubbery sacrifice?_ Remy Lebeau only if you want to say the n word._ Ni? \n\n\n\n\nnANi?!_ Stop making a fool of yourself by joking about such a serious subject like this, you come off as ignorant and disrespectful. Get out of your bubble, this is real life._ Interesting viewpoint. Are there no words that someone you know and respect can say to you that would upset you? Like your parent calling you a failure? Or your best friend calling you a backstabber? If those examples do not affect you, then understanding this woman will be quite difficult. The word hurts her, no matter what you think of it.\n\nThe question that's really interesting is if we should alter our speach to accomodate for that. What are your thoughts on that?_ @benverzijlbergen2968¬† What do words from family and friends have to do with society wide declarations of what words we can say and what words should be terribly offensive?\nI think I understand her quite enough. She is not helping white people or black people.\n\n\n\"the word hurts her\" \nAnd that is precisely why I suggested that she will never achieve peace of mind.\n\n\nI would not agree with altering speech for her, she has no right to not be offended. And consideration should be reserved for family and friends, not some leftist stranger that declares you to be racist if you don't follow her dictates._ Yeah, why tf is no one talking about that!_ Very good argument. Ofcourse, when you want to discuss possible discrimination, you'll have to default to something to discern between the americans that are affected ny it and the ones that are not. How would you make the distinction then?_ Yulad A. The only term is human_ Kyle Kissack get over it wdymüòë. So say if someone is all up in your face making racial slurs about your race, u just not gon think about it. Just get over it?ü§® I don‚Äôt really think you know how it feels to be oppressed or bullied. That‚Äôs just like if you had depression and someone just told your ‚Äòyou‚Äôre fine‚Äô. Do you really think ignoring it helps?_ Ouff, it's like a catch 22 in a Pandora's box. A word carries the weight, history and baggage it accumulates over time. This one's history goes to some powerful and ugly places. \nSadly enough, completely avoiding it with such shock, shame, etc gives it even more power but vaguely and that lack of clarity and understanding can go literally anywhere.\n\nEducation,  I'd hope, is one place where it SHOULD be broached, explored, explained and taught, complete with how, when, where, why it became what it is today. Alternatively it can fester in the hidden corner of minds until someone else brings it out and takes it elsewhere. After all, avoiding it doesn't erase it and facilitates continuing issues of what that word calls out. It's still in music, books, videos, TV, movies and more and I'd rather folks not earn that as exclusive truth.\n\nIf you have to avoid something, you also have to watch for it so that also propagates issues and problems unless it does get properly addressed somewhere, isn't education the best and safest place for it?\n\nSaying only 'this group has permission to use that word' and then applying elaborate and evolving social rules and etiquette seems equally laden 'catch 22 in a Pandora's box' traps albeit in different ways.\n\nSide note: I still remember how hilarious Blazing Saddles was and how it starkly and publicly rubbed the stupidity of racism into viewers' minds; bravo to Mel Brooks for that, even if there's no way he could get away with it today. Deliberately mocking the idiocy behind racism in such a way doesn't seem like a totally evil thing, even if it can't really be publicly done anymore._ When I was at school, we read Of Mice And Men, and so as you can imagine, this issue came up for the few times it appears in the text. Our teacher didn't go all or nothing like the examples in the video, god no, instead she said at the start of the module that essentially she's here to teach us the book, to analyse it, to write about it, and that she wouldn't be doing us any favours by censoring it. We weren't encouraged to use the word but we were allowed to recite passages of the book uncensored, or we could refer to the word euphemistically, it was our choice. It was a small class so inappropriate use / bullying was never an issue._ Bravo Elizabeth Stordeur Pryor! Great job with this._ Try translating black to Spanish word\nBlack as a colour not skin colour_ Telling me not what to say because of the color of my skin? Your the one who's rascist._ I'm gonna say the n word_ This is the conversation of the day? Ugh_ And Richard Pryer said it publicly all the time...any relation? That would be hilarious and ironic._ As the son of comedian Richard Pryor, I was expecting her to be a lot funnier_ N_ N_ Proper guidance_ But why is she faking talking to an audience and not just looking at the camera? It seems so insincere this way._ What is N-world?_ It is the epitome if racism to tell somebody they cant say or do something based solely upon their skin color. Therefore when black people say white people cant say the n word, they are in fact the ones being racist._ The problem with racism in the USA is that you‚Äôre always talking about ducking racism_ GAMERS RISE UP_ Nicaragua_ If you are supposedly trying to rid the public from the use of the word- Then don't even bring it up!_ It's really not that complicated... I know the exact solution üòâüòé_ You were fortunate to be taught by a capable teacher._ good!_ that's not what how racism works but don't let that bother you white boy_ @guidemeChrist¬† That is exactly what racism is. But you don't care about that because you listen to the blithering idiots in SJW education that peddle the \"power plus privilege\" socialist \"redefine what words mean\" nonsense which conveniently excludes any minority from ever being racist._ @remyllebeau77¬† you can't just redefine words to mean whatever you want them to mean. Worda are defined by their usage. Racism against whites isn't a thing, sorry._ MRS OBAMA GET DOWN_ If you‚Äôre here to joke about the subject of a serious video just because it‚Äôs about something related to it and not here to learn and discuss about the genuine content it offers, get out._ Yes, that is his daughter-- I double checked._ Well she‚Äôs likely practiced performing it as if she were in front of an audience before the virus struck._ I don't understand the consonant N, I'm not native speaker_ Nincompoop_ Why aren't you getting more up votes?_ That doesn't make any sense. People aren't talking about enough, because it still exists everywhere. But I personally feel it'll never go away because the US was founded on it. The country would have to be restarted._ Which is?? ü§îü§î_ When you say \"the n word\" you're putting that word in my head. Making me the racist. Touche._ Nani?_ Regardless of what you say, the N-word or Using the word, or just saying another insult. It's just a word, its power is given not taken. Which is better, to know a bigot is a bigot or have it concealed by a euphemism or something other as insulting or worse! Keep giving it power, and no one ever will get behind it! Just like the F-word,  if I say F you, it means the same._ Isn't it just black in french.._ Okay. Thanks for the useless information_ Well, how about \"Negro\"? Or, as my grandfather would say, \"Nigra\"? Or, as I used in reading Huck Finn to my 8-yo's, \"gentleman\"? Try reading Huck Finn using gentleman and you will see how useful that it is._ I'm going to say it.....\n\n\n\n\nNickleback_ Is this Richard's Pryor daughter?_ I was doing some Spanish immersion in Per√∫ and my host brother, who doesn't speak English, at times would show off the English he did know, and we were working on something and he said \"good job my _______.\" He thought that the N word was the same as saying \"homie, bro,\" or any other word we use to mean \"friend\" or \"close friend.\" That is how this young person who doesn't speak English thinks the word is used based on context of popular culture uses._ N_ For some reason a lot of fascist types are really upset that people look down on them for using a certain word :(((_ Blacks don't want whites to have power over them but they want power over whites by \"not allowing\" whites to say a word. How ironic._ Its either ever slur is okay or none are okay._ How many were watching this during locmdown_ Excellent presentation! \"The 'N' word\" phrase is not the only one representing UGLY connotations. \"Old White Guy\", of which I am one, carries UGLY connotations as well. I believe this ugliness is mostly an expression of ignorance and insensitivity and I truly appreciate your very well put discussion on the subject._ So... I can't say \"nxgger is a horrible word and shouldn't be said\" ?_ I'd prefer if we as a society just let the word die. It will always be in our texts, movies, etc., but that doesn't mean we have to keep using it. A lot of words and phrases fall out of fashion. Why can't we see this as the racial slur that it is and let it die? Ice Cube told Bill Maher \"that's our word.\" Why though? It doesn't make sense to casually use a word as a greeting (see the rap culture) while simultaneously chastise/demonize anyone else (especially white folks) that use it just as casually. Let the word die._ don't agree 100%, but an informative perspective_ Patrice O'Neal had an interesting philosophy on this word. See The Green Room._ The n word is so restricted that when I watch American movies, I kinda guess what‚Äôs the meaning of the word and wonder why it‚Äôs so offensive. I do know the meaning of N word and kinda understand now but may I just say that before I thought ‚Äún word‚Äù means n*gro. And I‚Äôm sorry I hope I won‚Äôt offend anyone but is it also a restricted or offensive word? I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm just asking.

I'm African American and know that from my entire life. And there's nothing wrong with him using it that way._ @rim23473¬† it's interesting to consider. I would have to know more history of the involvement of Latino peoples in the United Stazian African/ European problems  before I could have an opinion._ And did you correct this person?_ Him using it that way contributes to the word changing its meaning from a racist slur, textbook definition of how a word is reclaimed._ I'm from South Asia and its crazy how many brown kids use the word for that reason_ Andreas Egeland ..stop being foolish_ @professional_silent_trumpe1540¬† ummmmm. Black people are brown too. \n\nThe brainwashing is astounding. \n\nNo one is ACTUALLY the color black. And no one is the color white. Because white and black are not colors.

As a future old white guy myself, I would love to know what term you think should replace those three words to defuse the complex feelings associated with it, and still make it discussable._ I agree that I'd prefer if the word died.

I would love to know what you think about an academic video I put together a week ago about the N-word. If you don't have time, I would understand._ He's old enough in that vid, and that vid is old enough to stomach his identity politics. But in 2020? I'd say, sorry Patrice, time to let it go. I find Patrice to be an incredibly wise individual btw...one of the greatest minds in comedy that left us too soon._ Are you leaprousy- white ?_ That is a very good question! As always, the meaning of a word is very much up to the speaker and the listener. So you could mean one thing, but the other person assumes you mean another. This lady makes a case for this specific 6-letter word to have only one meaning to all listeners and explains why she thinks it should not be mentioned out loud by anyone.\n\nSo technically, it should be fine to say your 5-letter version - though there are other, prefered words you can use when referring to a black person. It all boils down to how conciderate you want to be towards others._ Wow humans are silly. Not being able to utter the N word in any context is nonsensical. \r\n\r\n\"Nxgger\" is the only slur in the world, racist or otherwise, that's considered unacceptable to use in a neutral context. And by making it taboo, it needlessly requires a version of the word that's considered acceptable (i.e. \"N word\"). Furthermore, it traps those who are unacquainted with this quirk of language (e.g. the innocent girl in her class), and it subjects those who simply refer to \"nxgger\" (e.g. English departments at unversities) under unjust abuse. \r\n\r\nAnd making \"nxgger\" taboo hasn't provided any benefits. Ironically, if students (and everyone) could say the word \"nxgger\", it's meaning would be identical to how they use \"N word\" and so they wouldn't feel so uncomfortable about uttering \"nxgger\" (which seemed to be an argument from the speaker for forbidding \"nxgger\").\r\n\r\nIn short, taboo words are silly. And humans are silly._ Is Negro an N word anymore?_ \"Sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me\", 2020, COVID19, reevaluate meaning of that quote!_ I‚Äôm black and I don‚Äôt like to use the world,cuz I just fell is cursed and I hate to see it,discuss ab it,people using it, EVERYTHING\nAnd just like she said,every time the word comes up in a convo I fell everyone‚Äôs waiting for my reaction\nPeople don‚Äôt know how to use it and makes u fell bad anyways_ Never been called the N word but watching Black people react to the N-word is a hot mess. Nobody should have that much power over your emotions at all period_ If students in the US really have such serious problems with reading out texts containing the word \"negro\" then there is indeed something wrong with the education there..._ Many of the black people I know would refer to her as \"high yellow\" or \"light skinned\". I don't know any white people that even have thought patterns involving the n-word. The only people keeping it active are blacks in poverty. The whites I know are ready willing and able to completely move on from seeing this world thru a racial lens. But a lot of blacks won't let it go and won't accept the fact that they are equal and can do anything a white person can. That n-word is the catalyst for their poverty. If they can stop saying that word, and start speaking with more proper grammar (like this speaker), they will see all the doors open up for them._ How about never say negative degrading words that lead to violence, protests, and abuse?\n\nAnd say only positive words that have no racial bias or sexist demeanor. \nIf you are teaching about the \"N\" word in class as a teacher for black history reference. Don't say it. Instead, have the students read on the historical facts of those years. And tell the students you are teaching this to better understand the past so we don't repeat the past into the coming future generations. \n\nCaucasian people have been abused as well. Look at the Irish during the Civil War in America. The Irish daughters were raped daily by men of privilege and wealth to own a piece of Irish property(people) this went on for years back then in New York(New World). \n\nKnow your history. African Americans were not the only people being abused. \nAsians after the Pearl Harbor bombing were physically and mentally abused and some were thrown into detention camps in California for just being Asian. \nAsk the actor George Takei he spoke about it and remembers the struggle the Asian community had back then of abuse and violence. \n\nFACT: ALL races have endured a type of abuse. NO RACE is better than the other. Let's stop saying the words that remind us of those dark times. And only educate to not repeat the past. \n- END -_ Many people don‚Äôt want to use the ‚ÄòN‚Äô word in their vocabulary because it is offensive to the African American community. Should anyone use this word, even the African American people? Highly debatable. Love dictates kindness, this word is anything but kind._ If its not ok then none of it's ok. I'm talking about people who don't say it but use homophobic slurs._ Fortunantely, none of these offended black people suffered slavery. Racism is about treating people differently because of race. The \"n word\" is exactly that, treating who says it differently depending on their race. It is a word that separates races. As long as the \"n word\" is approached as it is nowadays racism will never end in the US.\nHow do you fight and end racism? Don't talk about it, forget it, and shame those who do. Race is just a physical characteristic like having a big nose or blue eyes. Being racist is just silly._ We CONDUIT! Yes We Can!!!!_ Know any Sly And The Family Stone songs?_ It‚Äôs an awful word born of cruelty. I don‚Äôt know why anyone of any stripe uses it._ Its extremely racist to CONTINUE to put a race behind a word... Stop thinking of ANY word being associated with a race. REAL racist associate the N word to a race. I don't. I use the N word in a diff context. You cannot control the meaning of my words. I don't live a commie shlthole. I live in USA._ Black woman in academia: I swore to never say the word\nBlack men in hip hop: nwordnwordnwordnwordnwordnword_ This is why Rap, Hip Hop, and R&B needs to be boycotted for use of the word. Once its collectively silenced, it will dissappear for good. Black people use it like its a friendly gesture. They say its ok because they drop the `ER¬¥ and replaced it with `A¬¥.  Guess what morons, Im from Massachusetts and the way we speak, the ER is always an A so its still the same word with the same meaning. Its ignorant  both by definition and from the mere use of it. You cant skin a peach and call it a plumb. Its just a skinned peach._ I support the ppl who use it to make its definition human instead of pure racial hate.  I think saying it ought not be cause for disruption.  Nwordphobes aren't good on nword rights, I find.  What about legalizing cocaine? wht about ending slavery in the prisons?  This taboo is pathetic and disappointing to me, just a parade of cowardice.  I am a white man and I am responsible for many utterances of the word, but I don't feel bad about any of it, quite the opposite.  It should mean human and t should be said._ Good morning Neighbor..._ Why is it ok then to say \"Sieg Heil\" for educational purposes?\nI'm more worried about the dude calling you a \"black a** piece o sh*\" who doesn't want your kids to go to the same school as theirs, than I am about the professor saying n**** simply to explain its history and what the word meant.\nPlease, let's all be grown ups and use common sense to judge these situations._ That phrase was probably never true people just never realised ._ Right!_ @sluggle7694¬† So we stay anchored in rage and victim-status. I say NO. We must not give ANY word that much power. We must move on._ ÿßÿ¨ŸÖŸÑ ÿ®ŸÜÿßÿ™ ÿ±Ÿàÿ≥Ÿäÿß_ exactly_ When someone uses the word for hate, it says more about the person saying it.  They are clearly hurting inside and trying to bring others down to their level of hurt._ And imagine when the victim has no big reaction, then the aggressor doesn't get what they want and maybe stops trying to use the word?_ Luna * you cant compare being called a nationality to a racial slur_ Lol, i cant believe you said that! I thought that saying things which might paint black people in a negative light are already became illegal._ It's hard to hear an accomplished professor choke up in her talk over a word. I want to feel for you, but consider the long suffered history of all walks of life throughout the world and can't think of allowing a word to ever own your feelings like this. Truly respect yourself and words can't break you this way. It hurts to think this reaction means you don't hold yourself in high esteem. That's the real painful shameful part. I could be wrong, of course. Just one person's view point. Any other valuable input from others?_ @walperstyle¬† LOL How's capitalism working for you?_ I‚Äôm gonna assume your black, let‚Äôs not talk about how other black people should feel. until you‚Äôve been called the N word, in a negative way, then speak on this, you have a very uninformed opinion._ @gdy2shus¬† I felt the same way, even if the intent is to offend we have a choice at the end of the day to not let it bother us in the slightest . Maybe she isn‚Äôt aware that we have that kind of power yet._ When it has a huge you meaning behind it you‚Äôre gonna have a reaction to it so much I said this is not a word that does not have a meaning to it_ if you actually watched this whole TED Talk, I doubt you'd say that_ The Niger River and the region around it have a rich history, with various ethnic groups such as the Hausa, Songhai, and Tuareg. The name ‚ÄúNiger‚Äù itself comes from the Tamashek phrase ‚Äúgher n-gheren,‚Äù meaning \"river among rivers\"\nThe Nile River, on the other hand, is associated with the Nilotic peoples, who inhabit regions along the Nile in countries like Sudan, South Sudan, and Egypt, which was then attributed to the people, NILE RIVER GHER PEOPLE , creating the word niger from latin meaning black and then black people took the n word that people used as derogatory and attributed the word NEGUS which is black royalty in regions of africa. i wish everyone took the time to do due diligence research and not just say stuff without proper info_ I would say this. 1) Going off on the cashier because they made a honest mistake and shorted you a dollar. Obviously no. Just to get that one out of the way. 2) Using the word to represent a historically accurate story or just a racist character in a story. Ok. That is story telling. 3) Using the world in reference to accurately telling a event that happened, such as the cashier in scenario one or using the word in reference to discussing the use of the word. 4) That doesn't mean you have to just pointlessly say it again and again like any foul language. Some people just don't want to hear endless foul language and that is fine. But in this post I could not even once just say the word in reference to discussing the word or youtube would flag my comment as bigoted. Because context is not allowed._ And why stop there? How about preferred pronouns, or titles? The list is longer than most people realise._ Absolutely_ Thank you!_ I don't think that's the best way to go about it tbh. I think sometimes racism is held irrationally, and the way to reintroduce rational thought is to talk about it, not forget it, and encourage people to be open about it. Racism isn't a problem that will just magically disapear, sadly_ Borderlands 3? ^.^_ Because using words in a way of comedy or to accept it takes away its power_ I don't know, if you saw some kind of slur against women's \"character\" in an old book, of which there are many, I don't think you would have the same kind of knee-jerk reaction, even though they too have a history of oppression, and even though misogyny is still alive today. \n\nI just don't understand the power that America has agreed to give to this word, or to any one word. I get it's a symbol, but still, from the outside, it just seems a bit extreme._ üòÇüòÇ_ @bubba lee Wait, you actually think the biggest numbers of people who listen to rap music are white?_ @bubba lee Like, seriously?ü§£ü§£_ bubba lee stranger danger üö®üö®_ @bubba lee says the person with a cartoon as their profile ?_ Somebody in the comment section who uses his brain_ @gsftb¬† Thank you, I really needed that laugh_ Crazeee Nigrifagritard yayy you , congrats big boy . I think the reason why the word doesn‚Äôt bother you is because there is no equivalent for the word for white people so you won‚Äôt understand why people black Americans in particular have a problem with it . I‚Äôm not African American but I understand why they have problem with it and prefer for it not to be said. The fact that you are proud to say it I honestly hope no black person has the horror of coming across you in daily life._ Adrina Ebanks i respect you and your opinion.  Thank you for talking tome about this.  Cocaine should be legal but is not because of Nixon and Bush‚Äôs racism in the drug war.  That is all I meant.

Either way thanks for sharing ü•∞_ I have no problem saying NO!_ Very excellent lecture from very beautiful fluent  tongue .thank you so much_ As an Oriental who likes the word I'm terrified of what word next the language police are gonna ban._ I wonder what the ancient Romans would think about a simple word from their language become so taboo._ I born and raise in Indonesia and that made me an Asian by default. This word is becoming a problem for us too.\n\nLet's start with a case. Maybe some of you know Indonesian Rapper Rich Brian who start his carreer with song that has \"that N word\" in it. That music video went viral and people start arguing about the way he choose his rap name and the way he mention the word in his music.\n\nLike Rich, most of Indonesian ‚Äì or Asian in general ‚Äì don't know that background history of the word. The very first time we see or heard that word is from video game or songs. Then later, we use that word without knowing the root and not even knowing how powerfull that word is.  I personally learn the history of that word is from english course that i attend after i graduated from High School. I actually never learn, heard or read that word from Elementary School until High School.\n\nSo, i just want to see your opinion about this. Maybe some of you in this comment sections are a native American and probably could give your own perspective. üòäüáÆüá©üá∫üá≤_ By promoting \"political correctness\" you are in fact promoting hypocrisy and censorship.

It is a word derived from another word over a hundred years ago. It gained in popularity to become a word with a negative conotation attached to it. It has now got such a bad rep that it is now being hounded into non-existence , at least by some countries. So should we do the same for words such as 'queer' or 'gay'. They similarly have had there original meanings altered. And as Elizabeth pointed out it was used hundreds of time in Mark Twains books, as a means of identyfying the colour of the person, not as a slur. It does seem strange that the gravity of the word very much depends on the colour of the person using it ! ?_ You guys are giving superpowers to a word.  A word is just a word.\n\nWhat really matters here is the institutionalized racism framing the very core of American existence Wich is carried in that word.\n\nDoes the word has any power to detach someone from their humanity?  No, perpetuation of legal racism does.  \n\nBlacks are only hurt because they understand the hate and power carried in the word, and they feel hopeless to deal with it.  Why?  Because for so long it has been institutionalized desempoweing Blacks.\n\nThe reaction is pain and hopelessness.  This is what hurts.  The word by itself only brings up the ignorance of those who use it._ I say it \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNin ten do ‚ù§_ I feel like she has the best intentions but the problem starts with assuming that everyone finds the word uncomfortable to speak about. Rather the difficulty lies in the socialization of people that they have to react to the word. She hinges on how uncomfortable it made black students as white classmates gauge their reaction to hearing the word and then the discomfort of one student, who I'll assume was white though she doesn't specify, who hid from the class in which she'd have to say the word. This is beyond free speech, it's about beginning the healing process. I don't think anyone should be forced to say it, neither should anyone be forced to censor it, especially in academic settings. The issue I have is that it's only hard if you make it hard to talk about.

We can never even begin to get over race and lessen racism when a large group of people (white people) like to act as if they do not understand it and just make fun of it or dismiss it. I don't know why we waste our time on it, because they are willfully ignorant and will stay so because they like being so. There are SO many sources out there for them if they truly wanted to learn and do something about it. Some white people have actually taken it upon themselves to do so, which is great, but you still have so many of them who just do not care. Empathy is pretty much dead for those types.

What's the problem?_ @NotQuiteFirst¬† a few things you might not realize, but firstly and most importantly, by pointing out her light pigmentation, you have tried to discredit her personal struggles and experiences based on her skin.

And people won‚Äôt explain it to them because of the feels._ @geoffrobinson¬† ¬†Yet, the point the speaker was making is that the inent does not matter. She herself is in the field of education and refuses to use it because of the assiciation she herself, and possibly others, have with the word. \n\nDo you believe it is the job of the listener to filter what someone is saying down to the bare data and process it like that, or do you think it's the speaker's obligation to present the information he wants to convey in the most acceptable way possible, as to not impede the exchange of ideas and information?\n\nI'm interested in hearing your thoughts on that._ @benverzijlbergen2968¬† I think we shouldn't treat anyone like they are driven primarily by their emotions. People will go down to the level of their expectations. Raise the expectations on them and make them aware that words aren't magical talismans.\n\n\nIf someone gets upset because the word is used because someone is reading a quote or is talking about the word, explain the difference to them. If they don't understand, they shouldn't be in a setting where intellectual discourse is being held because they aren't ready for it due to either being too emotional or not having the intellectual capacity to understand proper distinctions yet. And the teachers who coddle them shouldn't be teaching because they are doing a disservice to the students under their care by retarding their intellectual and emotional growth._ @becker1264¬† Wheres the oppressed on that first scenario tho?

A great talk. Thank you for posting._ I dont think anyone should be saying it, period. Black people saying it on repeat to each other and in rap music, ect just emphisizes how common and important it is. Non white people being able to say the soft A version over and over and see no repercussions just makes it double racist against white people. Either everyone but black people can't say it, or everyone who isn't black can say it, or else its a vehicle of racism against white people.\n\nGetting rid of racism doesn't mean just racism against black people, it means racism against EVERYONE.\n\nThe message doesnt work if only some people get to be racist, and others dont. That's not equality, thats not fair. \n\n\nAnthropologist for decades now has tried to show the world that Race is fictional, it doesn't exist, and no one listens to us.\n\n\nNo one should be saying the word, especially black people of all people because black people know by far the most the impact of that word, and no one should be example of that word being acceptable to use.

Really funny, seriously :)_ Not saying it will basically not change anything, racists will still be racists regardless. I wish we could learn to make informed judgements of what was or wasn't an inappropriate use, put things into context and accept that not everyone has the same level of sensitivity to it, mostly given current pop culture. You're not erasing the past or changing it's meaning by using a phrase instead._ I find it interesting that some people let a word have power over their self. If someone calls you a name and you are offended then you are giving them respect. Otherwise how could someone you have zero respect for ever offend you by calling you a name?_ Thank you üôèüèæ_ Yeah, you are right. I think your topic is very important. Thank you_ I think saying the n word is okay however you should never use it to with people who are not confertable hearing it and also you should never say it it in anger for instance never say it as a insult so basically as a friendly greeting it‚Äôs okay but whenever your are in a situation where the word becomes offensive racist or harmful just be mindful of your surroundings be polite and just don‚Äôt be stupid when saying it._ Gotta say, props for her talking about this and saying what the N-word has on the impact on others and throughout history how it's more then a word._ English isn't my mother tongue, I took 10 minutes to understand what does \"n-word\" mean._ yeh I'm sure she first heard the word at school_ She's very white tbh. 40%+_ Having an arrangement of letters that you're \"not allowed to say\" is extremely childish...\n(Especially when lucky enough to live in a country that has freedom of speech)._ Great talk._ I have found the lady responsible for the pussification of part of the school system.

The amount of times they say it to me. Doesn't bother me at all. It's just a word. It's the feeling behind it that matters_ Xantium0 exactly,but if people use it to us in a way of discrimination it fells really bad,in the other hand if u used it with friends,they ain‚Äôt doing it to hurt u,just as a word that‚Äôs it_ It will lose its power, when either everybody knows about it and refuse to use it or when nobody knows it_ The problem with this is that it was a word used by one subgroup of people to discriminate against another subgroup of people. To mutually bridge this divide, both parties need to agree that the word is 'bad' or 'good'.\n\nWe will always be in a state of conflict if non-black people can just go ahead and start using it, or if black people can just use it while non-black people cannot (current contexts).\n\nBoth parties need to agree. Exposing black people to the most derogatory word in recent history won't change anything. To remove the stigma or the word itself, black people need to be fine with the use of the word, or non-black people need to agree that the word is inherently bad.\n\nThis is wishful thinking though. Humans aren't perfect. There will never be a time in the near future where all races come together and hold a conference regarding this issue. That's just not how American society works (thank God). So, taking into account the harm caused and realities of Western society, the most realistic solution right now is to take reactive countermeasures by making the word itself socially 'bad'. Making the word 'good' will take time, if not centuries. And doing that now will cause more conflicts. That's just the reality of society today. \n\nOf course, it's quite stupid to be arguing about the morality of a word. A word is harmless, and the meanings that people give to it is where the issue -- from the human context -- arises. Racism and discrimination are social constructs, and its significance from the eyes of its perpetrators and victims are what gives it importance. \n\nHowever, we're humans, and the current status of the word today has allowed all human subgroups of American and Western society to function well together. So I think, taking into account the state of society today, the problem here is not that 'people aren't using it enough'. That would only cause more problems. Rather, the problem here is that people want to change the status quo rapidly by socially sanctioning its use. In a perfect society where all affected groups see mutual benefit for it, that would be perfect. However, that is not the case, at least today._ Did u watch the video? 9/10 ur prob not black, and it‚Äôs such a derogatory term towards us, so it shouldn‚Äôt be used in the first place._ Mia Harper correct no one should use it but too often black people use the term especially my black male students. Either it is okay or it is not_ FranBunnyFFXII Fax_ FranBunnyFFXII exactly!  Well said._ telling an oppressed person not to say something isn't fair... asking your oppressor and his relatives who still benefit from his oppressive ways not to use a word that offends you when said by them is asking you to be sensitive to the pain it causes. This isn't an issue of fairness. Its an issue of understanding. Sadly you and others have yet to understand._ In my experience with African Americans and those who use the word  are reclaiming it secondly they don‚Äôt have a problem with the word it‚Äôs the intent  why does this bother you so much is also an important question_ @jwiggins5100¬†  Racism is racism. Period.\nJust because someone is oppressed doesn't mean they get free license to be racist in return. That's not an issue of not understanding, that's just assuming that anyone who isn't black is a racist.\nStop it. \n\nAnd don't even try to tell a part black, transgender person they \"don't understand.\"_ The Niger River and the region around it have a rich history, with various ethnic groups such as the Hausa, Songhai, and Tuareg. The name ‚ÄúNiger‚Äù itself comes from the Tamashek phrase ‚Äúgher n-gheren,‚Äù meaning \"river among rivers\"\nThe Nile River, on the other hand, is associated with the Nilotic peoples, who inhabit regions along the Nile in countries like Sudan, South Sudan, and Egypt, which was then attributed to the people, NILE RIVER GHER PEOPLE , creating the word niger from latin meaning black and then black people took the n word that people used as derogatory and attributed the word NEGUS which is black royalty in regions of africa. i wish everyone took the time to do due diligence research and not just say stuff without proper info_ you are not right you are a bit more wrong than you are right and i disagree_ I'll say all three.  Doesnt mean I at all agree implications._ Racism us a beautiful thing that should be protected in our 2nd amendment_ Some things are better left unsaid._ That's how it used to be up until 30 years ago. As the speaker said \"The N word\" is a relatively new entry into the English Language. So young people may wonder how the word was referenced with non racist intentions as  \"The N word\" is used today?......They just said the word. And the listener knew you weren't intending it to be offensive.\nIt was similar to how we would view the word \"Idiot\". You would be offended if your kid was called that by his teacher, but we don't do around referring to \"The I word\"._ @alansands256¬† the ignorance in you is staggering and shows why CRT is needed you are the perfect example of the ‚Äú I‚Äù word! The HISTORY that the ‚ÄúI‚Äù word has is NOT tied to SLAVERY and Racism white supremacy and LYNCHINGS and RAPE and MURDER and bashing babies heads against rocks or any other of that savage BARBARIC Neanderthal behavior...I do not believe the ‚ÄúI‚Äù word carries that historical European baggage! 465 years is not a short time in existence when it SHOULD NOT EXIST IN THE FIRST PLACE ! You should think before you speak_ I agree there is not much progress as it appears on the surface of referring to the slur with \"N-word\". It can still recall past traumatic experiences perhaps less so. I think we could avoid having to make distinctions about appropriate or inappropriate use when speaking. Recognizing that we have different levels of sensitivity to it, using \"the N-word\" may allow others to be more comfortable joining into discussion about it at all._ Racism these days is mostly made up by race hustlers like this professor._ Say it with your hand on your glock, then it's totally safe_ Yeah but they still don‚Äôt like it even when we say it_ Daniel McNair what do you mean by we and at least in Europe black people don‚Äôt mind when I say the n word however I am not white or black I am Southern European and have lots of black friends so that may have something to do with it_ Plz what does it mean??üòÇ_ Rabia Azzaoui it‚Äôs a hateful word slave owners would call slaves and is a racial slur against black people_ @levmarchuk998¬† ahh i see ..thanks for saying_ @levmarchuk998¬† so how come black people call each other it all the time?

I know many non gang member black people(believe it or not they are not all gang members) who use it._ @Wa1terBrandi¬† my point was, that the fact that black people using it like a fashion word for themselves and giving it the attribute 'cool' is the reason why it is kept alive in language itself_ @gsftb¬† Good point. Then the question becomes: Can the positive use of the word begin to outweigh the negative associations? Is it worth it? And who gets to decide?\n\nWhat are your thoughts on that?_ An arrangement of letters? So is everything I say just an arrangement of letters with no meaning whatsoever? Certain arrangements have meaning, don't act otherwise.

I've been thinking out an argument back to you but I think i need a good week of thinking about the subject of interpretation and meaning of arguments. I know this is a bit of a cop-out comment but thanks for giving me something to think about and also we need to all agree on the meaning of 'florbo' so we can add that wonderful word to the English dictionary as fast as possible._ ‚Äã¬†@ALovelyBunchOfDragonballz¬† How dare you say that?

I'll look forward to hear him lecture about any topic he finds interesting or valuable. Some TED talks are shallow and lack any real substance and usually come down to \"X is amazing, it's as fast as 99999999hz and there are millions and millions of it\" which only contributes to viewer interest but doesn't teach anything substancial beyond that.\nThis presentation, however, was very valuable and in-depth (considering this isn't a bilogy/medical class) where the instructor wasn't afraid of losing his audience because of complicated information or \"boring\" topics._ Thank you for this beautiful presentation. It allowed me to appreciate the Power of Almighty God, the One._ The mechanism for how you process sound is impressive and all, but how you SEE is like next-level ultra voodoo by comparison....

Guess the noise level is much more comfortable with the lockdown._ I think it's just within the brain\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucination_ The  brain has a tendency to interpret noise and ways that are not always truthful. I have seen situations where dripping water sounded like conversations that were muted just enough that you could not make out the details of what was being said.\n\nHearing¬†is all about perception, and expectation plays a huge role. Your brain uses context to interpret the signals it receives from the sound waves that hit your ear. Research has found that when you expect to hear sound, the brain‚Äôs auditory cortex is activated in the same way as when you‚Äôre¬†actually¬†hearing sound.\n\nResearch \"temporal induction\"._ There's something similar to your question as it relates to vision and color-blindness. Typically color-blindness is a deficiency of some sort within the actual eyes themselves, however there is ALSO a condition within the brain that can cause \"color-blindness\" for a person with perfectly functional eyes who should otherwise be able to see normally. \n\nLong story short; your body definitely can screw with you, but the brain can screw with you on a whole different level..._ Evolution? Really???  How many millions of years of evolutionary failure were there before the accident got it right?_ ProjectPhysX add to that the ‚Äúmiracle of evolution‚Äù of sight with all its complexities of colors and the ability to focus close and far in an instant. The wonders of taste too complex to enumerate in one sentence. Tact with all its intricacies like heat and cold, pain and dullness. Then add the delicate balances of hormones and chemicals that make us feel happiness, fear, sadness. No, it can‚Äôt be a ‚Äúmiracle of evolution‚Äù. The more scientists study the human body, the less likely they are to believe it came about by mere chance or evolving from a single called organism._ @gabrielsandoval4994¬† our eyes aren't that great compared what nature has to offer. All vertebrate eyes have the rods and cones behind the layer of nerve cell circuitry, an evolutionary failure, artifact of embryonic development throughout evolution. Squids on the other hand have their retina the right way, rods and cones up front and circuitry layer behind; their eyesight is even better than ours. And some shrimp eyes focus light with millions of microscopic mirrors instead of a lens and have vision all the way from UV to IR... ;)\nThe closer you look, the more similarities you see across phylogeny and the more you understand gradual development of features through evolution. Science is not about believing, it's about knowing for sure. No creationism required :)_ ProjectPhysX there are many examples of animals that surpass us in many fields, eyesight being one, strength being another, so one and so forth, but they are in the end  used only to survive. Our senses not only allow us to survive, but we derive pleasure and joy from our senses. Take a look at all of these in unison and you begin to comprehend that it could not have come about by chance. We‚Äôve not even scratched the surface on how magnificently we‚Äôre made, I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a Ted talks concerning the human brain. I‚Äôd like to know your opinion on this topic, then perhaps move on to the unfathomable complexity of human reproduction and the forming of babies. How every organ and body part is written down and set forth through something scientists are just beginning to comprehend, DNA. A master manual that forms every living being. The marvels of life are never ending._ @ProjectPhysX¬† same bullshit again and again. Our eyes are suitable for us. Period. We don't need shrimp eyes or squid eyes because we are not f...ing shrimp or squid. If they had brains like yours, they would write the same stupid comments on YouTube._ God \"might\" be amazing.  You have no proof._ This was really great! I only wish we got to see the entire process of hearing and how a soundwave hits the ear drum then somehow gets translated through the stirrup etc. and all this other stuff into what we hear.  I have a vested interest and that's why I want to learn. Sometimes I think I get swollen (I think it's the protective muscle for loud noise) in the middle ear and hear distorted sound and off-key music for a week on one side; seems to be triggered by crunchy food. Let me tell you, you no longer take hearing for granted after a week of hearing totally different pitches coming into both ears! It scared me straight and I was so relieved it wasn't my cochlea or something when it went back to normal. I couldn't hear any bass below 100hz either.

I didn‚Äôt know about the higher risk of dementia. üò¢_ Beautiful speaker.... intelligent inside outside_ I love all my fellow sisters going through peri and meno ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§_ This is actually bad advice when it comes to menopause. Please educate yourself on this so you can give them good advice and not go with the ‚Äòsuffer‚Äô because you are a woman thing we have all been fed for so long. Having brittle bones and extreme muscle and tissue depletion because of bad advice in your youth around fear of medical intervention is not a good look!_ Women are smarter. Drop the Mike._ Most harsh thing it this, that during transition through menopause you have to work...no special vacation, no extra sick days...no surprise, that women end up depressed, sick and in enxiety...unfair, girls. We are very fragile in this age..._ Men and women are different from the brain cell up, hormones affect every part of the brain,  but gender is not part of it... come off it!!!  This PC nonsense undermines your scientific perspective._ I'm 43 and in menopause. My memory has been bad for the last year._ I had a surgical menopause at 36. I had no idea what I was in for. Since then I have aged super fast - my skin, my hair and my brain. \nNever have your ovaries removed unless it's absolutely necessary.  \nI regret it so so much._ Very nice presentation.\nI can co-relate with it as I am going through menopause and very surprised as u have lost zeal in most of things and way my thinking has fogged. \nYoga has helped me a lot but I think the process should plateau and not keep on increasing_ 47 here. I have less patience with annoying, arrogant, selfish, and entitled people._ one brain among them; minds like swiss cheese..._ Imagine the brain of women who have chronicle migrainas. It‚Äôs a mess during peri menopause._ I have hit perimenopause and feels like my brain is atrophying. Now this makes sense!_ For a year ,I complained to my orthopedic doctor that my hip and right shoulder were in pain. His answer was I needed to work out, and I needed to do some strength training, so he recommended physical therapy. I explained to him that it felt like someone took a hot knife, stabbed my gluteus, and slid down the gluteus muscle. He then said it's probably piriformis or sciatica. I am no orthopedic doctor, but I know my body, and I knew it wasn't either of those.\n One year later the problem became progressively worse to the point that I was limping daily. I was no longer able to do any strength training because it made matters worse.I was fortunate enough to have another provider who was concerned about my well-being, and after making numerous requests to my orthopedic doctor for an mri, he said one wasn't needed, thank goodness she disagreed. Lo and behold, I had a labral tear and a torn rotator cuff. I was disappointed, angry, and dismayed that my complaints went unheard for a whole year by my orthopedic doctor although my concerns were valid.I have done the research on perimenopause and menopause, these are the symptoms and sometimes side effects that can happen with women. The fact, that when I made this complaint, my provider was very dismissive and I fear that I may have caused more damage over the past year. This is so important and it is imperative that we find the right providers who want to listen to us and know that we truly know our bodies! This is great, and I'm so glad she shared this information! When I hear other women speak about frozen shoulder and having a hard time moving and that their hips feel really tight, I no longer feel alone. This is an adjustment and it is definitely something that we are not prepared for by any means._ unlabeled y-axesüôÑ_ Hormonal therapy will fix the issue and she wouldn‚Äôt have so many symptoms. But it‚Äôs not beneficial to the Medical business!_ At 67 I still sweat all night and sleep with a wet towel and two fans!_ Doesn‚Äôt make any sense first claimed no different brains in gender then there are all the differences in the rest of the talk .. lol of course it differs, testo brain vs oestrogen brain_ The cognitive dissonance in the first 50 seconds is remarkable._ What a wonderful speaker Dr Lisa is‚Ä¶fantastic jog and you deserve that standing ovation_ What can I do to help with symptoms and anything to benefit any low brain energy and my other many menopause and life symptoms. I‚Äôm 58, stopped periods at 50. I have had hot flushes since, restless sleep (although I‚Äôve always had disturbed sleep due to several injuries, back, neck, shoulders, costochondritis etc. I also have depression, anxiety that‚Äôs affect me ontop of all the rest._ It‚Äôs easy to say ‚Äòget a good night‚Äôs sleep to help stay healthy‚Äô, but I literally have not slept through the night in the 7 years since menopause. Short term memory is shot. I still have hot flashes. It truly messes up your body, but it‚Äôs still better than the perimenopause horror show that preceded it.  Exercise helps a lot with mood and any bouts of rage. It‚Äôs important for your physical health too.  Gotta keep those bones strong!_ i'm not buying it.  I am 56 and am happier than i have ever been...finally living as my AUTHENTIC SELF...this sounds like the patriarchy talking..._ Everything is a choice. Following feminist agenda, wanting to be equal with men in anything, like it's a competition. When one asks for it one gets it. I'm a woman btw._ @leedixon4228¬†such a weak trolling attempt._ I had mine removed (brca2) last year at age 41. It's been rough. How are you doing now? I can't take HRT bc I had breast cancer_ Find a good non force chiropractor. Works wonders. More effective than physical therapy. Move, but even if you don't workout, stretch everyday. Particularly in the morning and before bed. Just 15 min is all you need. Keeps the joints lubricated._ So, men don't experience menopause. Just wondering, what's their excuse for forgetfulness, mood swings, depression, whining, dry skin, aching joints, etc? ü§î Just saying, men I know experience many if not all of these issues. I'm 72 and think I might have had a couple of hot flashes in my forties. My mother, 92, had hot flashes pretty bad. She took hormones for a while. Her mother, my grandmother, said she thought she had menopause one day üòÇ._ I‚Äôm on Anasrozole to suppress oestrogen after having breast cancer , so even though the Mediterranean diet is super healthy, maybe those that need to suppress oestrogen should stay clear of this diet ?_ This was amazing. It helps me understand so much! Why isn‚Äôt this information given out at every doctor appt, every clinic checkup, and every other medical intervention for women?!_ Where us the rest if this speech? üòÆ_ Men are going to use this to not give equal opportunity and pay less for same skills._ I have suffered for decades actually because I was in an abusive relationship (I had no idea, I always felt like I am doing something wrong), so my doctor gave me some medication that put my body through menopause in my late 20s, 42 now and really struggling with unemployment, lonliness etc very difficult in German speaking country because they are very racist and violent people_ The ones you mentioned in the comments, be careful about hormone replacement theraphy. Try natural herbs instead._ This is so true_ Thank you for such valuable information! I‚Äôve booked an appointment with my gynecologist to talk about getting HRT! I‚Äôve hade enough of \n the lack of sleep and energy due to loss of estrogen! No amount of eating healthy or exercising can make up for the loss of estrogen in the body!_ Im 49 and peri and I feel bad for my family as much as I wish they felt bad for me if they only knew what I was going through. I have 3 children. 14, 12, and 10. My husband is going through cancer treatment. I feel terrible when I can't be the caregiver I wish I could be all the time.\nI take natural supplements. I try to eat good. And I exercise 5 times a day. Spiritual health is #1. Keep up the good fight. Your worth it üéâüí™ü™ñüå±_ If only male doctors would see this Ted talk üò¢_ All women should listen/watch this_ This is why women are given adequate rest at least 7 days during their periods and 40 days postnatal time. But, it is a pity that women in their bid to be equal in competition with men ignore these facts  and are prone to stress and depression.  Men are ignorant or not allowed to give the needed notice for their conditions._ Thank you ‚ù§_ I wish I‚Äôd seen this 4 years ago when it was new! I‚Äôve GOT to get a Female PCP ‚Äî I‚Äôm tired of my doctor berating me about not losing weight fast enough while not taking my hormone levels into account!_ \"There is no such thing as a gendered brain\" but women's brains are different from men? You can't have both._ I've been struggling with these issues for a few years üòÆüò¢. Thank you üôè this was a huge eye opener. \nDealing with only male Drs in my small town, it's been even worse_ When my now ex partner called the police to our house one day I felt like we were living in earlier times....my god men are really shallow sometimes_ Excellent insight. Very relatable. More power to women brain!!_ Yay for lisa üéâ_ Im pretty sure they studied that._ Im sure he had his reasons_ @andrealy72¬† you would think so but no he didn't. Probably why the judge told my lawyer to get the matter out of his court room. And why the police warned him against manipulation of their services . I had more reason to call them on him actually._ I have had low estrogen since 2018. Nobody picked it up except my one GP. Been put on anti anxiety, anti depression, etc etc. made out to be crazy for a period of 3 years. \n\nMy GP put me on estrogen tablets. Together with the hormone tablets and the epilepsy/anxiety drug I had an epileptic fit. I quit all the meds. Dr admitted she put me on wrong hormones. \n\nThey keep ignoring the fact that I had an ovary removed due to etopic pregnancy\n\nI hate the word anxiety_ I am also going through menopause have big size uterine fibroids and have also suddenly developed epilepsy till now have ten episodes since 2018 can anyone please help me in knowing whether it is hormonal affect. Doctors are saying epilepsy is genetic but it is not there in my family history_ Beautifully said. Lots of great key information , concise and to the point. ‚ù§_ Watching this while being awake for 38 hours._ thank you for this very good information, it has answered my question about changes in my mind/brain. I had menopause 2021. I have no much physical symptoms, thank God  however since mid2024 I notice my mind is very fickle, am thinking this and just a second I would change my mind and do something else. Today 2025, am trying to figure out what to do or is happening to me and browse over YT and saw this. Again thanks. From the Philippines._ I had breast cancer and can't do HRT what do I do?_ Is mental and emotional burnout part of menopause. My whole life has been consumed by stress. I can't change my circumstances. What do i do??_ This talk changed my life üò¢_ I am so glad i came  across this video. I am 49 and for the past 2 years my memory is failing me üò¢.  Ive been to gynecologist and according to him i am not in menopause. I still have my menstruation and i dont get the hot flashes. However i have cold feet and hands throughout the seasons. I have terrible joint aches and brain fogüò¢. I crave sweet things all the time and gained weight._ Thank u    so informative_ She started by saying there's no such thing as a gendered brain, then spent the whole talk refuting that, ending with \"The Female Brain\" in her main point. What was the point of playing the PC card at the beginning, if you're just going to obfuscate it? Maybe she had to in order to give her talk?_ I‚Äôm 57 and the lights went off with intimacy. It sucks. I finally found a gynecologist that is helping me. I have a blood clotting disorder that I was born with so taking hormones is not an option for me. I thought it was just a scenario of ‚Äúsuck it up, buttercup and deal with it‚Äù until I found an amazing gynecologist.  PT is healing me so much. Yes, PT!_ Who's most likely to have their Will threatened?_ I am balling my eyes out, not just listening to this doctor but feom reading all of these comments from women who are feeling and thinking the way I am!!!! I HAVE to send this video to my husband because he thinks that this is all just in my head and that I am imagining all of this! From being forgetful, the aches and pains, having no patience, the crying at the drop of a hat, my horrible sleeping pattern. Like I am up till 2-4am and I know I am tired. I fall asleep standing up, I fall asleep sitting up, and I should go to bedbut I just can't or don't, and I can't figure out why!!! We are raising our 5 year old granddaughter, and I have to be up by 5am to get her to school! I get very little time to myself and not mych help! I feel moat days like I am just going to completely lose my mind and fall apart!!! \n\nThank you, ladies, for sharing your experiences and helping me to feel not so alone!!! ‚ù§_ This is terrifying. I‚Äôm 51. How lovely men don‚Äôt get to experience this._ Absolutely brilliant.. I have listened and shared the link with my acquaintances male and female üëåüëç_ I wrote off my sanity and good manners with my period, now I just expect people to put up with me without apology.   After a long marriage and raising kids...it's now my turn to be a pain in the butt.  When they can't take it anymore they can put me on an ice fragment and float me out to sea.  Which will be interesting because I live in California. BTW -  I always say, \" I can't remember.\"..it's my canned answer for everything.... It gets me out of trouble, obligations and commitments._ Thank youü©µ_ üôè_ So there are no \"gendered brains\" but men and women's brains are wired differently\". Ok, sounds like gendered brains. Glad she had to kowtow to the woke mob before actually talking about science._ ‚ù§_ Dr Louise Newson and Dr Mary Clare they have info and apps and check lists etc you can take to your doctor and even courses the doctor can do. You aren't alone. Big hug ‚ù§_ Is that all you got out of this?? Really???_ @Lilsheepish¬† Did I say that's all I got out of it?_ @ pretty much. Need to read between your own lines. We have to support each other as women during these times. Positive before negative. I get it. We all have bad days but next time take breath, maybe even write it out and delete it and then post something positive. Happy New year.üåû_ @Lilsheepish¬† You're reading way too much venom into what I wrote. Maybe don't assume the worst of other's intentions. I was saying that to come out of the gate with a statement that brains aren't gendered weakens the argument she's making and is unnecessary, especially as she goes on to explicate the opposite. Your assumptions about my emotions on the topic are incorrect. I nearly stopped the video at the first statement about brains not being gendered, because there is so much science saying otherwise. I'm glad I listened to the whole thing, but I almost didn't because she began by making a false PC statement that didn't match her content otherwise._ @Lilsheepish¬† I am sorry you had a bad day. I hope tomorrow is better for you._ Just curious how PT is helping? My husband is a PT. \n\nI‚Äôm currently seeing (for the 3rd time in 10+ years) a female Pelvic Floor PT.\n\nI‚Äôm 52. One month away from menopause. ü•µ_ You are definitely not alone. Dr Mary Clare and Dr Louise Newson has great resources. They also have info sheets etc for your husband to read. Be safe and go help yourself. HRT saved my life and my marriage but it still isn't all smooth sailing....be your own advocate and go research..you've got this. Big hug.‚ù§Ô∏è_ Thank you @shannon_w , I thought I was alone. Spending my nights watching you tube or TV, falling asleep everywhere (even on wc), but unwilling to go to bed, even if I appreciate it. I thought it was 'only' a psychologic problem, but possibly It Is not.\nI'm 62 now and menopause arrived 15 years ago, after the loss of a dear aunt with sla.\nI didn't want hrt because I thought it was a natural process to go trough.\nActually I gained weight, losing the feeling of satiety, and felt less attractive.

Husbands men, families, friends need to know how much we go through. It‚Äôs extremely hard for us woman._ Amazingü•∞_ Yes!_ Hello Dr Lisa, I only discovered you a few weeks ago. I also started listening to Dr Louise Newson, who, for some reason, I had not paid much attention to. I've been on HRT 10 yrs but buried my head when it didn't fully work. Turns out I was missing a hormone, so I am in the early stages of trialling it, along with my others. I am 58 with a womb. \nAbout Dr Louise Newson and you, a few weeks ago, I thought it would be good for you two to meet online. Lo! and behold, Dr Newson and you had already got together, twice, once four years ago, and about a year ago. I loved to hear you both speak and for some reason, the info went in, as the missing hormone means my attention span is shot. Being autistic complicates it for me as well._ I saw a post asking why us post menopausal women don‚Äôt take HRT‚Ä¶ some of us can‚Äôt because we were diagnosed with estrogen positive breast cancer, which is why some of us go into early menopause. First, the chemotherapy forces you into menopause, then, some may have to get hysterectomy and oophorectomy to keep the cancer from coming back. My brain fog is terrible and I look like I‚Äôm 10 years older than I should be, hair thinning, wrinkles, weight gain. That said, I‚Äôm happy to be alive. ‚ù§._ Gender plays no role in the difference between a man and a woman's brain.... then proceeds to tell us how gender plays a significant role in the difference between a man and woman's brain.... üôÑ_ very informative thanks_ Thank you!!! ‚ù§_ Great info! But what are the foods to avoid???_ Sometimes when I have brain fog and my body can't cope, I don't want to live anymore üò¢ I visited the doctors many times, and all they say it is stress_ how can you have 30% less brain energy.    yet,,,, they're still as sharp as they were beforehand????\nsooo they start at 30% ??  more misinformation.   adopt your cats. ¬†\n\ndont buy them_ Que bom que descobri essa mulher!

Everyday i feel like failure_ Men.. if you ever loved her before the change, love her more than ever during and after. We need it from you to see the best in us even when there‚Äôs not much to be seen or felt._ Of course hormone therapy can alleviate these symptoms. There needs to be more studies...many more studies on how this helps, when to start, what dosages, etc. If men experienced menopause in the way women do (a drop in their essential brain regulating hormones), you can be sure this have been answered decades ago._ ‚ù§‚ù§üíØüíØüíØüíØ_ I first came across her on Diary of a CEOs. Absolutely brilliant summary here of that talk üëç_ No one talks about what we go through. I starred suffering at 45 with perimenopause.

It will help you need estrogen progesterone and testosterone replacement._ @ thank you so much yes I am on estrogen patch and the topical but I couldn‚Äôt get the testosterone due to insurance not paying I will try to get it soon_ Is that all you have taken from this???_ Stick toa Mediterranean diet and you'll be fine. Just do not eat anything that's inflammatory. There is alot of resources out there. Dr Mary Clare has a diet called the Galveston Diet but most say stick toa Mediterranean diet_ Hang in there. Sending you good vibes._ Big hugs.xx Try and see if you can get HRT. Exercise, Mediterranean diet and relaxation techniques. You will still have bad days but will feel ALOT better.x_ @Lilsheepish¬† thank you so much üôè‚ù§Ô∏è_ @suzettefialho666¬† Have a look at Dr Louise Newson and Dr Mary Claire Haver.

Be Well üíöüíöüíö_ You definitely are not a failure. Research research research you are your own advocate. Dr Louise Newson and Dr Mary Clare awesome resources._ very interesting, thank you._ What a wonderful woman I love her so much!_ this lady is a wonder woman! brilliant_ A useful and important lecture. üëçBut it saddens and anger me how in medicine the normality is men and how they work, while women are the abnormality. So the normal brain is the male brain. And then we have the female brain that differs from the male. Why isn't the femal the normality and the male the one that differs?\n\nThis might look like details not worth getting upset about, but i believe that words matter. They color how we view the world._ I just go to work so menopause can't rob me of being a human being. But people think I'm taking sik days off when I actually can't push myself enuf to go to work when menopause gets too hard. I hate having to tell people that I got a cold ._ How do I know if my mom is in menopause or just started hating me?_ Love u Lisa and Thanks alot, wil start my better days since today after watching ur research ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§üéâ_ @firstlast-em2yq\n4 hours ago\nMen also experience cognitive changes as they age, particularly due to the natural decline in testosterone levels. This phenomenon is sometimes referred to as \"andropause\" or \"male menopause,\" although these terms are not entirely accurate, as the changes men experience are more gradual and less abrupt than those experienced by women during menopause.\nAs men age, they may experience the following cognitive changes:\n\nSlower processing speed\nDecreased attention span and concentration\nReduced spatial abilities\nDecline in verbal memory and fluency_ It's important that Dr. Mosconi's opinions are not seen as generalized in the scientific community but are just her personal conclusions. Using a highly subjective term like \"menopause brain\" can provide a new weapon for misogynistic individuals to wield against women in the intellectual workforce. It's crucial to be mindful of the language we use and to avoid terms that can be easily misappropriated to perpetuate discrimination and bigotry. More Importantly, the term \"menopause brain,\"  is a dangerous expression because it can indeed be weaponized to promote misogyny and discrimination against women, particularly in intellectual and professional settings. \n The potential for misuse of this term is significant:\nPitting women against each other: The term \"menopause brain\" could be used to create a divide between younger and older women, perpetuating the harmful narrative that women's value and competence decline with age. Justifying discrimination: Misogynistic individuals may use the concept of \"menopause brain\" to justify discriminating against women in the workplace, arguing that they are less capable or reliable due to their hormonal changes. Undermining women's credibility: The term could be used to undermine women's intellectual contributions and opinions, dismissing their ideas as a result of their supposed \"menopause brain.\" Reinforcing negative stereotypes: \"Menopause brain\" can reinforce negative stereotypes about women being overly emotional, irrational, or unstable, further marginalizing them in professional and personal contexts. Discouraging women from seeking leadership roles: The fear of being perceived as having a \"menopause brain\" may discourage women from pursuing leadership positions or speaking up in the workplace, limiting their career advancement and representation in decision-making roles_ This is a good talk but as usual with Drs. WE, Humans are justa a body, so most changes in the body have nothing to do with our emotional state, sociaI or cultural conditioning or ancestral memories. I wonder how come they don't even question the fact, that may be, just may be, there are other factors other than simply physical , that produce these hormonal changes._ It's not so easy as simply \"improving sleep and reducing stress\" if you're caring for a teen with a learning disability and additional needs üò©_ Excellent information! Thank you, Lisa Mosconi_ Dark Chocolate, check ‚úÖÔ∏è_ How will this effect trans people? They are taking all these hormones. Just an fyi question._ The happy relationship Killer..üòû_ Bravo_ It's really too bad that the speaker does not recommend estrogen therapy.  A new report released by the government this week examines 10 million women 65 and older for 13 years.  The conclusion was that estrogen decreased all cause mortality by 19%, reduced several forms of heart disease, reduced incidence of 5 different cancers including breast cancer (also ovarian, uterine, lung, and colo-rectal) and if a woman DID get breast cancer while on estrogen, her prognosis was more favorable.  Oh, and reduced risk of dementia which is the point of this talk.  Instead of recommending soy and flax seeds (which I also eat) she should have heeded the science and ALSO recommended Hormone Replacement Therapy_ 30yo last menstrual 12/21 and in 2022 i seen 2 different doctors both said im postmenopausal  according to blood test also my egg count is 0.03 so I can no longer naturally become pregnant I have 1 child born 2013 and 02/21 I had a tubal and had my right tube removed so I only have my left tube now.

Can't handle the smallest amount of stress. NOT once was I told this could be peri by the woman psychologist I was seeing. Instead she said getting on meds for my depression and anxiety will help. I was absolutely against it bc I felt something was wrong with my actual physical body. Had a hormone test done which my provider told me I was likely in peri bc of my symptoms. Turns out I have very low progesterone and my DHEAS is almost nonexistent. So I will be starting on a compound cream with both ingredients. I knew I wasn't crazy.

The ones who did not say they went through menopause in about a year and moved on while the ones on hormones say they are still suffering from menopause. I‚Äôm curious‚Ä¶if you went through menopause naturally how long did it take for everything to calm down? If you did it with hormones what was your experience?

Literally within an hour or so, my mood lifted and I was back to normal after that. HRT meant I kept my hair (not always the case with menopause), my skin improved as did my figure. HRT especially good for the bones as bones thin, get more fragile after menopause. I would recommend it but it is for each woman to decide   There were often sorts of scares about breast cancer at that time but this is now discounted.

In the end she died of bowel cancer. I honestly think the sweating she did outweighed any risk of cancer that HRT might have given her._ Reducing caloric intake, fasting and regular Exercise would have helped you better (and a lot more naturally) than rushing headlong into doctors and their HRT!_ I‚Äôm 60 and started menopause at 52. 8 yrs ago, no interventions. Still get hot flashes and sleeplessness. And some mood stuff. 8 years is a long time and I just keep on going anyway. The hot flashes are truly connected to diet especially sugar. For me.

Thank you_ Why are my breast tender after using vag. estrogen?_ What about taking hormone blockers from having breast cancer?_ Anecdotal but:  In my family it's men who get dementia first, followed by their wives who live through the horror of serving as their caregivers.  As a nulliparous woman who got her period at 12, I'm already entering peri-menopause in my late 30's.  This worries me to no end.  I already cannot sleep AT ALL around my periods, which are coming nearly 2 weeks apart some months.   Lack of sleep is also independently linked to dementia so that's another risk factor.  I would love to take estrogen but the risk of endometrial and other cancers freaks me out.  (I cannot tolerate progestins by themselves or in combination w/ estrogen due to mood & migraine with aura issues). But Premarin made me feel great when I used it for my menstrual migraines._ That was interesting to see how oestrogen falls quite dramatically after menopause.  However, one statistic I would quibble with here is she said in older population 2/3 of Alzheimers is women. BUT women live longer than men, so without more statitistical back up and age detail I personally am not convinced. Also if men have much lower oestrogen in the first place,  I dont understand the correlation why loss of oestrogen causes more Alzheimers. In my own experience women are if anything outperforming the men or at least equalling them in the old age mental stakes. Seems to me there are too many variables deleted to make this stand up._ M satisfied with the explanation_ Menopause has ruined me mentally physically emotionally psychologically - the conditions I have since menopause are horrible - oestrogen affects my histamine intolerance - vicious circle‚Ä¶ Progesterone is more important than oestrogen_ I'm almost 52...going into menopause and my health is just out of whack.

Statistically, I would have an 80% chance of  another 20 years with no \"treatment\". At 64 years old I'm okay with those odds, especially if the remaining years are good ones! Our \"standard of care\" in Canada is so corrupt, pandering to the greed of big pharma. \nInitially, it seemed like a bad idea to disable my immune system with radiation and drugs during a pandemic. Glad I declined all of that 2 years ago, so far so good. Fasting, sleeping, stress reduction, exercise. No ill effects experienced!_ I'm on my 10th year of dealing with menopausal symptoms.  Thankfully, they are not as intense as in the beginning, but STILL bothersome.  I hate the depression that I still get just before a hot flash hits.  I guess we can call it depression flash because it only lasts until the hot flash hits and then it's gone.  Weird - huh? Again, that feeling is not as intense anymore.   Still have to throw the bed covers off of me during the night as I get a little too warm under the covers.  But, again, thank God it's not like it used to be.

I'll do almost anything to get relief from the crap! Therefore, two days ago, my doctor put me on hormone pills and after just two days, I feel soooooo much better!_ @mindymac_does_stuff_ just shows how much teaching mums fail to do  imagine forgetting to warn your daughters of menopause    hahah.  what good advice DID she give you in life???_ I had my last child at 40. Now, moving into peri. I can relate. However, I changed my diet. No wheat, almost no carbs, lots of meat and eggs, regular exercise (swimming) has taken much of the pain away. I recommend looking into Mindy Pelz and her book Fast Like A Girl. Excellent and doable!_ You have a 5 yr old and are going through menopause? Unless you have actually been tested, had blood work etc. I would not jump to that conclusion. Find a good woman doc that specializes in menopause. So many things you can do. Good luck!_ ‚Äã¬†@tamgsmith8077¬†She probably had IVF. 43 is too late to have a child._ I hear you.  I understand the feeling that your body is at war with itself!  I also had my last child at 43._ Your comment comes off as belittling trans people. Why do that?_ This is exactly the problem, women talking about women's issues is interpreted as \"anti-twans\" , such a misogynistic cult!_ @AmanitaWoodrose¬† explain to me how denying transgenderism exists is anything but anti-trans._ @debbieknight8901¬† So you think anyone who doesn't believe in God is anti-god? It's called disagreeing... stop ascribing hateful intentions to those who  do not agree that men can be women or vice-versa_ @AmanitaWoodrose¬† well, atheists certainly aren't \"pro God\" now are they? If it isn't hateful to deny a person's very existence when there is plenty of evidence that supports their existence (as opposed to believing by faith alone as one must do to believe in the God of the Bible) it is at the very least very ignorant, and at this point, willfully so._ @debbieknight8901¬† It seems you are perceiving only 'pro' or 'anti', how binary!  No one is denying the existence of the people who feel they were born in the wrong body, simply disagreeing with the concept which is imaginary and harmful. I wish these people received therapy towards the aim of self-acceptance, rather than being encouraged to persist in their delusion. Mental illness should not be treated with surgery._ @AmanitaWoodrose¬† I was using your flawed analogy with the anti/pro thing... Anyway, it is arrogant, condescending, and judgmental to speak as if you are the expert on someone else's experience, making claims of mental illness about people you've never met. Your lack of understanding and/or belief about being transgender does not make it imaginary. And what makes it harmful to be transgender is largely that lack of understanding/belief from others, a lack which can and too frequently does lead to ridicule, discrimination, and even violence. As far as surgery is concerned, other people's medical decisions are none of my business._ @debbieknight8901¬† \nWhy do that!!???  \nPerhaps, because women are sick & tired of being told they don‚Äôt know what a woman is & also having to put up with every single discussion about WOMEN being hijacked by folk like you! \nFolk that aren‚Äôt happy unless they‚Äôre utterly miserable & frantically attempting to infect everyone else. \nTake your misery elsewhere & let women, dealing with women‚Äôs issues, discuss it freely‚Ä¶_ @obsolise8063¬† your denial of transgender women does not make them disappear. Why does their existence threaten you so?\n\nAlso, for the record, as a woman myself and born female, you do not speak for me with your \"women are sick & tired ...\" comment. Please speak only for yourself without including me._ @debbieknight8901¬† That's  a stretch. You are reading in._ @AmanitaWoodrose¬† I agree._ @debbieknight8901¬† Why does everything have to be about trans people? This is off-topic._ @bunnybgood411¬† you can't possibly not get that the original \"knows what a woman is\" comment was anything but a denial of the existence of transgender women._ Praise the lord ‚ù§finally_ OMG,......._ Shes talking about female brains, so yes science and menopause is anti-trans, if you like. \nThey can have our menopause symptoms if they wish (it'll never happen)_ GET PROFESSIONAL HELP!!üôÑ_ I need a menopause diet to help with hot flashes!_ That was so informative. Thank you.   Bless you all who do the researchüíó_ Excellent!_ When societies heal their beliefs about woman and begin to honor us , and we begin to honor our own divinity then we will heal our heart body and minds together. Forgiveness kindness compassion ‚ú®Ô∏è healthy eating , healthy thinking healthy body exercise etc._ This was really helpful and encouraging_ Very informative talk,thank you, great speaker_ I'm 36 and I feel like I'm discovering all of this information at the perfect time._ My mum had a hysterectomy at 43. Three years ago Alzheimers showed its ugly face at 83.She never took HRT. My sisters and I are now in our 50's and have gone into menopause at 53,54 and 57 respectively. We are on HRT hoping that might delay or prevent any cognitive decline in the future. Not to mention heart disease or osteoporosis.  I am my mums fulltime carer and I couldn't do that if I wasn't on hrt. Menopause was draining me._ Omg, thank god im a man. Our reproductive organs are pure fun, women‚Äôs reproductive organs are out to torment them! Pms, periods, pregnancy and then menopause. Oml_ This video is priceless, so much useful information based on state-of-the-art science! More videos on women's' health TED please!_ Bravo_ I started having hot flushes 11 yrs ago when I was peri menopausal. They have continued to this day despite trying all sorts of herbal remedies. More recently I have become extremely forgetful and have brain fog a lot. Frequent migraines as well. I honestly feel I am a shadow of who I once was. Menopause has taken so much from me. I miss the old ( younger ) me. üò¢_ What an incredibly insightful and engaging  TED talk this was! Plus , this lady is simply adorable. :)_ I just need to say that the person who discovered that amyloid were responsible fir alzheimers, he actually fiddled his results for funding. They are still actively trying to find out what causes alzheimers_ That was an awesome and useful talk. Thank you for the information._ It happens to men with extremes amounts of Estrogen. Older men. It can cause memory loss._ Its real üí• TY for the validating confirmation \nWomen Empowering Women is BEAUTIFUL üíô_ Toughen up ladies, it's not an oil rig job._ I breezed through menopause without any major problems except hot flashes and mood swings. I used HRT and it helped with these symptoms as well as my skin and hair. Don't remember any sleep disturbance._ Thank you  so much  for  this vedio its a relief_ I sympathize as it's been the same for me. I only know women whose experience was an absolute breeze. Its debilitating.. hang in there!_ HRT is going to solve all of your symptoms_ Grata ‚ù§Ô∏è_ I guess pizza is included in the Mediterranean diet. üòÇ_ Going through perimenopause now. Not good when I need 200% efficiency at workplace. 200% because we women normally need to prove more than men to show our worth.. I am screwed.._ Knowledge is self empowerment. Thanks to the research of many . May our daughter and their daughters. Have more information and self care knowledge._ WE ARE JUST AS SHARP_ wow this was a life changing TED talk for millions of women - thank you Lisa Mosconi!!! üíúüíúüíúüíú_ There is no such thing as a gendered brain‚Ä¶ However men‚Äôs brains differ from women‚Äôs brains.\n\nOK. Lol after this statement I do not trust this woman. I don‚Äôt care how smart she is._ So, basically, we maybe tired, but we're just as sharp. Thanks for reassuring. üòä‚ù§Ô∏è_ I went through menopause experiencing absolutely nothing.  No medication, no reason for any changes during the menopause years.  Life just went on as normal, aside from the blessing of no monthly cycle and no children.  I never experienced much of anything when I did have monthly cycles however either.  It was three days, no emotions, no pain, no changes...didn't really even notice.  I guess I was extremely fortunate._ I feel like I have scrabbled eggs for a brain! Now I know why!_ This is so important to know because feeling does not define who we are inside. Men is a men and women is a woman doesn't matter how they feel. We can denied that._ Awesome üëç \nI needed this today, going through surgical menopause and feel so low.._ Merci oh combien merci de mettre des mots sur ce que je ressens!_ I feel like crying watching this. My moods have been every where. I am glad to see the practical info she provided about diet.

Thank you for the information. Very helpful._ Does pri-menopause cause you to have painful nipples_ Because of menopause and changes to my cognitive function - decline in sharpness, brain fog - I lost a wonderful career.  Fired for low productivity and lack of contributions after years of being the 'star'._ being a woman, the gift that keeps on giving_ I didnt think there was a difference between men and women.  If someone is a trans woman (no surgery, nio hormone meds) do they still go through these homonal changes?_ Lol. You caught that too._ I feel like I have written that for me but reading all the comments here I thought I am the only woman in this world that never had a problem with a cycle and menopause._ I had no problems with cycle my whole life...only started in perimenopause.  Everyone is different_ Happy for you!_ Just another reason why it sucks to be female._ This was incredibly relevant to me.  I wish I could sit with her for hours for more info.

Perhaps_ And how do you know?_ How can she say there is no gendered brain when it‚Äôs obvious male and female brains require different hormones._ Super interesting!!_ Loved this! Thank you for your work in this area._ I get it, you need to hide the biomedical truth from the masses. But really, the question should be: why ought we inflict early senescence on every woman? Why not offer hormone replacement therapy as standard longevity therapy? Estradiole is fairly cheap to make, and looking at ostheoporosis, alzheimer's, mood disorders etc etc etc, would clearly be a win even if you cared nothing for women's well-being on an emotional level. That is, unless we discover that continuing on estradiole for 20 years longer makes your breast cancer risk skyrocket. But still, shouldn't that risk-reward trade-off be something for the woman herself to decide?\n\nAlso, she starts with 'there is no such thing as gendered brain' and at 12:32 says, and I quote: 'changing the way we understand THE FEMALE BRAIN' [emphasis added]\nAlso, reduction of circulation or available energy for computation in the brain is fairly unproblematically understood as loss of function. How many of us can honestly claim to do our best cognitive work when we're exhausted, or sleep deprived, or really hungry?_ Thank you so much for this validating information.  So many of us have lived through the ‚Äúam I losing my mind‚Äù!!_ I have been changing since my late 30s! I knew before as the changes happened, people found it harder to talk about how they were feeling.  I must find it easy as I can‚Äôt shut up, ( I have no filter) I need people to know! I think others should share! We learn from each other. Stress is no easy thing to deal with, an understanding is was is required, power to women, I thank you üôè you are awesome üíúüôå_ Wow. I am in my twenties but my mum is currently suffering from menopause symptoms, especially memory loss. It really interests me that studies are showing a link between menopause and dementia and I really hope that, before I reach menopause,  there is something I can take to lower this risk. This is such an important and ground-breaking realisation._ I already knew this information.  I don't hear any solutions about taking hormones. The diet is already what I do.

I wonder what happens to transgender people who are often on lifelong hormone replacement therapy, if they have a lower risk of Alzheimers because their hormone levels do not decline with age or if their risk is actually higher because reproductive Organs are often removed at some point._ My girlfriend is 44 and for the last 6 months has been covertly abusive to me. Is there a chance she is going through the menopause? Tia_ Thank You so much for the really informative and interesting video which will be beneficial for many. Thank You for Posting._ I‚Äôm only 21 and I‚Äôm terrified of menopause men will never understand or support women_ Hormones therapy help me immensely. I could not remember anything, forgetful, could not sleep, I was a zombie during the day, I was messing up at work especially with numbers, depressed, my doctor put me on hormones therapy and over night I felt like a normal person.

If you start hormone therapy within 5 years of menopause it is safe from cardiovascular problems. There is no evidence that estradiol estrogen causes breast cancer. None at all. All these fears and warnings stemmed from the flawed 2002 WHI study and from the media jumping on it and presenting it out of context. This is a grave injustice to menopausal women which is all women eventually._ This lady knows her stuff.

I'm loving it!!!!_ A very high % of women, I think 200% more than the norm, or south Europe, can't remember where I had compared it, have their ovaries, etc, removed in the US/Canada even for things like fibroids, rather than taking the time/patience to remove the growth. Post-menopause I was recommended a hysterectomy for the most benign reason (a D&C took care of it), and told, by the male gynecologist, that ovaries had no function post-menopause, ie beyond reproduction. He got angry when I said they were important to keep for health reasons. I changed gynecologist (and am still angered he spoke to me that way, and how many others who might believe him). Having the option of changing doctors might not even be an option for many tho._ I have concluded having witnessed menopausal ladies over the years. Most of the ladies had severe stress and severe sweats. my theory is that the missing hormones is acknowledged by the brain as a invader and tries to kill it off with extreme heat as it does when we have a infection thus causing the sweats. The brain becomes confused causing stress as it tries to find what is causing this problem. Doctors are prescribing drugs for mental heath problems and should be giving hormone replacement pills instead._ Thank you for explaining all this to me, I have watched it twice to understand what my body is coping with.

Please. TED talks are a joke._ Love this presentation üåπ short, understandable and straight to the point üëè_ Low testosterone also known as \"Low-T\" is the man version of this. A whole bag of stuff goes wrong when the testosterone goes away. You would think by now our medical industry would have developed a cure for menopause and low-t. One pill that you could take that would restore hormone production to the correct levels and keep it there. Sucks that menopause affects the brain because cognitive troubles are something no one wants especially when you are younger than 80 years old._ So much good information.  \n\nAnd me being in the throes of this.

That is the undeniable Truth._ Is there anything like early menopause?_ What about women that has to have their overies removed. I had surgical menopause in my early 50th and have never been the same. It's now almost 10 years and the depression and anxiety  is so horrible. My greatest fear now is that l know something is going on in my brain.   My doctor scheduled a scan and I'm just praying that for the best._ Awsome and informative_ I needed to hear this. Thank you!!_ Thank you. A true Healer._ Curious: 6:03min - women's brain energy BEFORE menopause on average is still lower that the same age men's average level._ Curious: 0:39min \"No gendered brain\" vs. 2:20min ''These interactions (between brain and reproductive system) are mediated by our hormones that differ between the genders''. So female hormones influence female brain. Yet, there's no such thing as female or male brain because \"there's no gendered brain\". Brilliant._ I entered menopause at 24 after a painful fight with endometriosis and adenomiyosis and had a total of 10 open surgeries, after trying to remove fast growing endometriomas for 8 times i had a full histerectomy. It will be 2 years for me and besides an already existing depression and horrible hot flashes i didn't have any other symptoms_ I also think doctors need to take our brains in account before recommending a  hysterectomy, etc. I started bleeding again after having my uterus scraped. My doctor didn't know why I was still bleeding, didn't even see me, instead she referred me to a surgeon to get a hysterectomy.  As I wasn't bleeding heavy, I decided to wait it out and it stopped again after a month or so.  They also recommended oophorectomy because they assume the itching I have had for the last year is due to progesterone sensitivity and birth control pills made it 10x worse. No skin tests, just a guess based on my symptoms.  Fortunately,  I am a nurse and know the effects of no ovaries on the body. At no point did they go over the pros and cons. And they just say it's an easy surgery, not serious.  I'm sorry, but you are removing an organ from my body, and loss of ovaries can have long term consequences.  I'm 47. I will just scratch, continue to take cold showers and wait for mother nature to naturally turn off my ovaries.  ( I do hope it happens soon though. Although,  I have no symptoms besides full body itching, so I am not hopeful üò¨)_ Right there with you. hot flashes!

Started hormone pellet therapy immediately; as soon as FSH increased above 30 & menstrual cycles ceased.  There is absolutely no way I will allow the loss of estrogen to destroy my body.  My advice to women is just do the damn hormone therapy; with supplemental progesterone if you still have your uterus, and do blood work regularly to stay on top of your body's needs.  For God's sake, your body's cells clearly have estrogen receptors throughout, and it is in no way a secret what happens when our bodies lose this critical hormone, which shaped our gender and physiology.......Side-note; I am also supplementing with testosterone pellets to what is slightly supra-physiological levels (for women)... wish me luck, people of YouTube!  :) :)_ Well, just her opening is contradictory.

Use of terms like ‚Äúgender‚Äù, ‚Äúthere is no brain difference‚Äù. Obviously, there is difference: the hormonal interactions ab initio cause differences.

I had some strange symptoms this year that led me to start researching and I discovered that menopause is the least researched health concern on the planet. Doctors receive almost zero training on it. The studies they have been relying on for the last 20 years are not just flawed but completely misinterpreted and counterproductive. I urge you to seek some more recent information for the sake of all the women you know. The North American menopause society has released new guidelines this year and here on youtube there are several knowledgable experts that are trying to spread the word. In a nut shell, estrogen therapy has been demonized for no reason and hrt can eliminate most symptoms for most women with not just little to no harm, but prevents many very serious diseases like Alzheimers, osteoporosis and heart disease as long as estrogen is started early enough (withing ten years of menopause and best in perimenopause when symptoms actually begin) \nMy favorite channel is menopause Taylor, an obgyn surgeon. \nHealth to you and us all._ @V.Hansen.¬† very good and informative comment. Thank you for that_ As a man watching my wife deal with the changes (chemo induced), I agree there us little to no education on the subject and there should be for couples too,  as it has a huge impact on a marital relationship.  We all operate in a bit of a vacumn here. We are still together, but frankly, only just as after 8 years of trying to work out what is happening between us,  we are sort of getting there. Male partners want to understand their female partners too, it shouldnt be just a dirty secret women have to battle through alone._ Menopause has plenty of significance, here in the UK - if one can afford to go private‚Ä¶_ Oh my God!

Carbs which turn into sugar) must surely be a cornerstone in this process of going more smoothly through menopause.  Sugar, in most forms, is the absolute killer in modern life but no-one wants to talk about it's unbelievably destructive effects on the body!!!_ It‚Äôs still a scary topic to discuss HRT but I am a huge advocate of it and it gave me my life back. Eating phytoestrogens is great but I prefer mine scientifically regulated. In my 50s and now 60s i can identify on sight who is on HRT and who isn‚Äôt and as far as reducing cortisol that is fantastic,  but at a certain point you can‚Äôt prevent suppressing estrogen that isn‚Äôt there anymore. Estrogen is the fountain of youth._ So, if there is a god, its definitely a male because so much sucks about being a woman...._ I may sound dismissive but menopause is a natural part of life.  I passed through it with a few difficulties but they were not insurmountable.  Eating well and keeping healthy is the best way to support ourselves.

I felt so unbalanced and not myself.\n\nBut again, I thought it was a symptom of my breakup. But in retrospective it was menopause hormones run wild.\n\nThat was the worst of it for me.

Anyone else feel this?_ My lord  I was  25 just yesterday and today I‚Äôm suffering with all this symptoms...It‚Äôs has been bad... hot flashes and sweats day and night, blurry vision, depressed, unmotivated, fatigue, forgetful, can‚Äôt remember  my dreams anymore and this bothers  me a lot...I used to remember every single detail , also  had  my first panic attack last year...it was horrible...I cry a lot missing the old days...being me, just want to be me again, the me I was just three years ago before all this symptoms started...I feel trapped  unable to have a normal life again..._ Thank you for your research.  Your presentation has answered many of the questions I have had._ I'm so grateful that she included the cognitive function comparison. I was getting concerned üòÖ_ Thanks for this video,  very informative !_ I developed Dystonia during Menopause_ Lisa Mosconi kept me riveted to the screen. She is an excellent speaker. I appreciate her sharing the expertise on the subject of menopause. More importantly she actually gave us solutions no one else could, in the medical field. Amazing how she gives you raw scary facts and I am empowered with that. Sincere Thanks to Lisa and this platform_ The brain fog is off the charts. Yes, I think I am going crazy, I can't remember a thing._ A series of contradictions, !!_ Do you exercise regularly?_ Have experienced this myself,  after also having an early age hysterectomy ,  despite being health conscious._ @girlsoup01¬† Body no longer responds to exercise after menopause. One thing that bothers me are the muscles. No matter how hard you exercise them, they still seem to go softer and even shrink. I hate that._ Me too!_ I had to have a hysterectomy due to fibroids and right ovary removed at the same time due to a cyst, at 48. \nWomen go through so much physical change & stress and few people try to even understand.\nMy mother was a kind, compassionate physician to countless women, bless her. I lost her when I was 37, and missed her empathetic presence during two major surgeries.\nThis sweet lady reminds me of her. I'm 60 too..God bless you.. and be with you sis._ If I knew all the changes, both physical and mental, that having a full hysterectomy would bring about I would never have had it done. One big thing most women are not told beforehand is how the architecture of the body will be changed. The supporting structures are removed and balance and movement are thrust onto other areas which were never made to do this task. See how far a women can tuck in the belly area and it will become immediately apparent that there is little to no movement possible in that section._ @girlsoup01¬† i have always worked full time (physically demanding job), exercised, gardened,  did the yard work etc. In spite of autoimmune disorders I have just rapidly lost my abilities. I had no choice in getting the surgery and stopped HRT when I developed breast cancer. Thankfully caught at a very early stage. In spite of it all I kept going full steam ahead but the exhaustion etc. has finally won the war.  I just wish doctors would stop writing it all off as if it's just another natural process and we should 'suck it up'. I did, and I am no better off for it. Best wishes to you all dealing with the myriad outcomes._ @Cissy2cute¬† Focus on a mostly protein diet. I know that something like a carnivore style diet sounds crazy, but we need a lot more protein for muscle synthesis and maintenance as we age and fewer carbs due to menopause-induced insulin resistance. I‚Äôm starting early (I‚Äôm 48 and not perimenopausal yet) and hoping it helps, along with intermittent fasting._ Why are not one of you ladies on hormone replacement therapy? Not the weak and ineffective bioidentical hormone therapy but the real one? No ovaries or aged ovaries mean no estrogen. You are in an estrogen deficient state. Would you also go without replacing thyroid or insulin if you had thyroid deficiency(Hashimoto‚Äôs) or insulin deficiency (Diabetes) your doctors are negligent!_ @Cissy2cute¬† oh wow I didn't know that..my mom told me this that she was frustrated she couldn't gain muscle or strength from working out and was loosing her muscles and I just told her what works for young people, like making sure you get enough protein and calories overall, doing fewer reps and heavier weights...I think I really need to educate myself more on the effects of menopause, cause somehow there is a lot of taboo around it and people don't really talk about the physical and mental changes that happen_ @elsagrace3893¬† I agree, HRT could help with many of these issues but I think it is also linked to an increased risk of cancer, but definitely something you could discuss with your doctor if HRT might be an option_ @trishcraig723¬† No male doctor can truly understand the changes menopause thrusts on the body. It is not \"all in our heads\"._ @mikadoavocado5164¬† you can think what you want and you will until you read the studies. The only increase in cancer is Uterine and that is when women do not take the progesterone pets ibex with it. Doctors are notoriously behind when it comes to science updates. It‚Äôs sad really. In the best salons hairdressers are required to take yearly trading updates but doctors are not.  Increased risk of blood clots or stroke only occurs in women who start HRT after 10 years of menopause. Before that it is Cardiovascular protective._ @girlsoup01¬† exercise and diet can never replace the job of a hormone._ @mikadoavocado5164¬† Most women don't know how the body changes in menopause and often wonder what they are doing wrong. It is why so many develop an apple shaped body. Even some medications act differently. One woman started to take choline to help with her fatty liver, since it has been proven to help get rid of the fat. Just over one week she gained 5 lbs. There is research going on to learn why this happens to some post-menopausal women. What a disappointment!_ I was 27 when this horror started_ Yesss....for sure_ Oh yes_ Definitely_ Absolutely_ My aches made me so tired but this winter I don't ache as much and even did evening swims after 1 year 4 months of oestrogen. I swim as it is my job and the movement and oxygen from the trees help. Lungs better. Feel brighter, finding solutions to problems. Fatigue not as bad due to less aches. Can get quite manic after a day outdoors at work, cleaning too now which couldn't manage before. Fatigue since hit 38. Hysterectomy at 44. Anxiety from 49 eased off._ I think that is linked to the osteoporosis (which is an inflammation) she mentioned and that hrt has been shown to help with that.  Tbf, it hasn‚Äôt helped me but lots of more people have told me it does for them.   I‚Äôve started taking Tumeric supplements which seem to help along with more exercise (which seems counterintuitive but has improved it)_ üíØ_ I have that almost everyday. On rainy or cold days I feel worse, I have arthritis. The only good thing about menopause is no more periods. I take a CVS pharmacy version of menopause relief that contains soy, and a vitamin E supplement._ Definitely...getting better with HRT.‚ù§_ I had no health issues until menopause. Now I have multiple autoimmune issues._ Please stop eating inflammatory foods like starches: wheat/gluten, potatoes, rice. I highly recommend reading Fast Like A Girl by Mindy Pelz!!!! Exercise a little every day! Swimming is great for taking pressure off the joints and strengthening muscles. I'm 45 and am feeling some of the effects of peri but it has been so much less painful when I started eating right and exercising regularly. Ditch the wheat to start!_ I remember my Dad in his 50s use to tell me things get harder physically etc...he was a builder..so maybe something in the aging process as well in general_ And your 50s is generally a time for issues that were already there in previous years to erupt and make themselves well known ..for example rheumatoid arthritis and this can be in men and women_ Yes..I‚Äôd like to know if there‚Äôs impact on such.many women start getting a lot of body pain etc ‚Ä¶inflammation can increase and even fibromyalgia can be diagnosed. Is there a link ?_ Same things here with me üò≠_ Pray talk to God about how you feel..cry even if you think His not around..He is with you His just waiting for you. You will be relief ..pls don't allow the devil to still your joy. God bless youüôè_ Misleading though. OF COURSE you are less sharp when you are tired._ @TomNook.¬† What about symptoms or onset of Alzheimer's & sharpness. I'd say its pretty obvious that cognitive decline follows. Thats the way it just is._ It's very difficult to believe that a woman gong through menopause is going to be as \"productive\" as before menopause, given the PET scan and symptoms described._ thank you...a very informative content. I'm 51 and everything she said helped me understand about menopausal effects._ I am rather displeased with this TED talk.There IS a genderered brain because Dr. Mosconi herself concedes that fact and due to smaller brain size women have to rely on higher brain efficiency to reach the same level of IQ as men that they do. Their verbal skills tend to be superior and bilaterally represented. The central theme of the talk is that menopause inflicts some damage to the brain of the women. Women are taking a lot of comfort in that fact which is unwarranted. Menopause inflicted brain damage does make women go \"crazy\" in mild cognitive dusfunction manner not the schizophrenia type. The damage to brain is a damage and there is some cognitive impairment anyway. There is no specific pathology that Dr. Mosconi describes that she has identified. So the talk is effectively waste of time even though the number of posts on it is huge showing that woman are seeking affirmation and consolation.They are taking a lot of comfort in the fact that someone validates them. That is fine but there is nothing scientific or neurological in this talk._ I found extra nutrition helped me during the change. Especially Vitamin D. But there is no denying that when the estrogen stops the whole system falls apart and reorganizes itself. So take good care of preventative nutrition and be sure to get enough sleep. Im 74 and still have night sweats and a massive hot flash whenever I wake up from a sound sleep. Keep sleepwear and sheets and body clean even if you are showering twice a day. It's important._ Estrogen replacement is the best way.  In my opinion Diet helps but it's not as effective._ That was very informative. Thank you so much. Not looking forward to menopause, but it helps to get a \"heads-up\" on what to expect and understand why._ I wonder how many women are mistakenly diagnosed with mood disorders after menopause or after having their ovarian removal._ I have just begun taking oestrogen patches after following Diana McCall , Dr Louise Newson &¬†\nLiz Earle Wellbeing  (lots of ex Nhs ) they‚Äôve been exposing the lies about HRT and brining hope to me and I hope millions more women , I‚Äôve just got off the phone to my Mum who is in her early 70‚Äôs THIS IS LIFE CHANGING ! I FEEL FANTASTIC ARTER YEARS OF FEELING LIKE ( OTHERS LACK OF KNOWLEDGE] I WAS GOING MAD !!!!! HRT A GAMECHAMGER !!!!!!!!_ menopause affects the brain? Keep talking_ A 30% drop in brain energy, but no drop in cognitive performance ü§î NO WONDER IM SHATTERED at the end of the week!  I‚Äôm also annoyed that diet makes such an impactüôÑ I feel like crap after all those cheese crackers and pasta last nightüò¨ but sometimes I just want a break from chickpea saladsü§≠_ Ladies‚Äîtry wet cupping._ It is also vitally important to know if you are \"estrogen dominate\" - even during menopause - there are tests to determine this (urine & sweat lab tests).  Adding natural progesterone cream can help reduce hot flashes & night sweats during menopause.  High estrogen levels that are a result of processed foods, chemicals are stored in the fat.  Imbalances in the good estrogen levels versus the chemical or bad estrogens are common due to today's high level of pollutants & poor diets.  Don't just assume the hot flashes are caused by lack of estrogen & learn about the different types of estrogens & progesterones._ Wonderful that more attention is being brought to this very important topic._ I have been doing my part reading and educating any women who will listen and confide in me as a physician, thank you for your part inthis complex issue , that seems to have escaped attention so far_ Women, eat Keto or good healthy fats. Low fat diets are awful and it affects the brain and hormones. Hormones and our brain needs fat._ This is very scary I‚Äôm suffering with menopause of all angles_ I cannot believe how many older people never talked about menopause.. Now going through it myself, my hot flashes and insomnia were debilitating.  HRT plus anti anxiety meds have helped me tremendously._ Wonderful work! Thank you so much Lisa._ I'm glad I watched this video bang on time. Can quite relate to it._ All of this is real....believe me._ U should start regular physical exercises. I personally have my own gym and exercise almost every evening. I m going through menopause i have nothing like debilitating hot flshes or insomnia. Maybe sometimes i m a little bit warm, nothing special, sometimes i can not sleep little bit longer, but it is seldom and does not affect my life in any way. Walking and inhaling fresh air and exercising is the key to everything, also leading non stressful life full of enjoyment. This is why i urge my children to work hard while they re young - to have peaceful old age_ I absolutely agree!! Why did they not tell us what we're in for or provide guidance on how to deal with it._ @protopiannelson5¬† exactly!_ Even when me and my mum are talking about it on the phone she doesnt like talking about it. She calls it The Change in a hushed voice. I'm 51 and she is nearly 80. I sometimes wonder how I even got concieved with that attitude!_ @JuniperJennifer666¬† Congratulations on having an easy transition. I agree that exercise makes everything better, but that being said, we're talking about an entirely different experience here. Do you really think, after listening to the video about actual brain changes that take place due to lack of estrogen, that no one else thought maybe exercise is beneficial? Just like another post mentioned yoga and meditation, yes that's great and once estrogen is replaced, those activities become doable again._ Still recall going through menopause early and trying to discuss it with mother-in-law who denied there were anything like hot flashes or insomnia wasn‚Äôt an issue. Evidently she never had one symptom from menopause (or maybe she was just a liar).  Anyway it would be much easier if people discussed it._ @Lee Nito¬† agreed. For me, it was debilitating because I was getting no sleep, my days were unbearable due to exhaustion._ My problem is I don‚Äôt want to take medicine for it, but if you said it helps you, what‚Äôs the name for it and does it have side effects? Thank you._ @des895¬† and taking bioidentical hormones_ My doctor would not give me hrt after menopause bc she said there‚Äôs a higher risk of breast cancer.üò©_ @jdenino6022¬† ugggg, I'm sorry. Maybe go for a second opinion._ @studiodibelcanto3647¬† I have belly fat but I've never heard of what you're saying. I've heard it's cortisol that causes the stubborn belly fat. I've noticed most women at this stage have a thicker mid section so if it's full of estrogen wouldn't that eliminate many issues and we wouldn't need HRT? That would mean that super skinny women with no belly fat would have the most severe issues?_ Wow, I agree. Also I identify hugely with this.  I cannot share about it right now however trust me we have so much in common with this of what you noted. Huh.. many of us put here plus Covid I believe has made it worse! Also coming for older men_ @pheart2381¬† My mom didn't have hardly any symptoms.  She was diagnosis with lupus in her early 40s and I believed it trump perimenopause and menopause.  Said she had a few hot flashes but nothing look what I'm going through.  Stress is the biggest factor for me._ @JuniperJennifer666¬† In my tropical climate, I am unable to do even 10 minutes of cardio before my face is red, pouring with sweat, and overheated, catch 22. So, exercising is out. Clean, fresh air I cannot find anywhere around me. Sadly, even simple things are really tough for some of us._ @leenito5808¬† Agree 100%. With the brain changes, how is one to find the motivation when listlessness is the predominant state; and even the tiniest amount of exercise makes me feel my overheated head is going to explode, not to mention the possibility of dehydration from the excessive sweating!_ ‚Äã¬†@jdenino6022¬† find a NAMS certified doctor. If you consider heart disease kills 1 out if 2 women and breast cancer is like 1 out of 8, your doctor is misinformed. The Women's Health study was a big debacle. My endocrinologist told me to take hrt and sent me to a NAMS specialist.  Estrogen keeps yoir blood vessels healthy and your brain too. Take iodine if you are qorried about breast cancer and lose weight because thise two things are definitely linkes to breast cancer._ @jdenino6022¬† he‚Äôs not update with current research. Go to another doc or see a naturopath._ In other words as women we are in trouble starting with peri menopause, and nobody tell us anything. We are lost dealing with our issues and dismissed by society. Most of the medical system dismiss us or here comes their little pills with hormones replacement or anxiolitics, antidepressants and problem solved according to them and good by to you. What happening in women bodies is more complicated  then the medical system gives us credit for and what most in society don't realize, or even want to talk about. Besides they are women's issues which usually means no issues._ I‚Äôm just getting into menopause and just yesterday I couldn‚Äôt even remember the name of our bank we use. I‚Äôve had other forgetful moments too._ Females are the heart of life._ So thankful for this explanation from an expert. Thank you._ I have been going through it for 2yrs an had to do my own research and finally on low does HRT omg best thing I ever did finally the hot flushes are under control and getting better sleep now just sorting out food that no longer agree. It's been so destroying I thought I was loosing my mind with all the symptoms I was getting an the brain fog is so hard not to mention weight gain._ What would happen to postmenopausal women that have to take hormone inhibitors medicine because breast cancer. Are they on their way to become demented?_ Is there a connection between Vitamin B and menopause symptoms?  I found that organic non GMO nutritional yeast, and also a potassium/sodium sugar free electrolyte powder helped immensely._ Wonder if the Trans \"Woman\" suffers all these debilitating diseases in life?_ Women have more anxiety and depression because they are having to deal with the men in their lives, its true!_ I have a raw food diet am 50 and don't have any hot flashes depression or pain or any symptoms she said. Menses just stopped one moment and that was it._ Any studies on those who had surgical menopause and the plaque?_ It's awful._ Brilliant!_ I LOVE this women.  What great information to share.  We arent crazy.  üòÇ_ Adding plant based phytooestrogens is the way to go. Unfortunately if you're the type of person to have eaten junk food all your life your transition through menopause is going to be rough - but take hope that it will pass one day. A vegan diet is the best in my opinion and I don't think it's too late to ever make that change._ I went through menopause with no problems at all, not even hot flushes._ It's frustrating that the individual components of menopause can be disabling but menopause is not a disability because \"nature.\" Short term disability should be available for menopause so your life doesn't fall apart & you take early retirement -- like I did._ ESTROGEN!!! All I needed was a little estrogen! It has changed my life!!!_ I am pre-menopausal and I look back at those times when I used to have a bad opinion of people who would get easily irritated by small things. I have always been super chilled and I just couldn't understand it. And now I'm one of them. As well as having occasional insomnia, depression and fatigue. The only positive is that it forced me to pay more attention to my diet and exercise more.  I won't let it crush me._ 4:36_ Does Trans \"Woman\" have ovaries?_ Whereas, I've had exactly the opposite experience.\n\nI stopped eating anything plant based, and felt a million times better than previously for ~two years.\n\nDue to various circumstance, I added back in vegetables, and my energy levels are depressed and blood pressure elevated again.\n\nI know in the new year, I'm looking to remove the plants again._ Same here._ Excellent presentation üëè üëèüëèüëè_ Hey ladies of all ages: may I suggest we all SHARE this video far & wide with all of our female friends and relatives üëç_ Women's brains are different than men's.  The cortex between hemispheres tend to be thicker._ This is great information! Thank you for your research and thank you for sharing üòä_ My mother has been going through this for a little while. Sadly it seems symptoms may have been getting worse since the passing of her father. She seems to be very stressed but shows it by worrying and stressing about everyone else. She will carry an idea over over going in circles. Alot of these things are not even happening or not how they actually happened. I just want to say yes to everything she says because otherwise it can become blown out proportions because she believes she is right an will not listen to any other opinion or idea and she never used to be this way. I just don't know how to have a conversation about this. I just want her to be happy an stress free but she thinks it's everyone else._ Wish my Doctor had offered me the info the health benefits of a diet containing foods high in phytoestrogen upon my recovery from my full abdominal hysterectomy at the age of 52\nI suffered physically and mentally for YEARS prior to recieving a correct diagnosis that lead to the necessity of the surgery...\n2 1/2yrs post surgery and with no guidance from any doctor, I have been suffering through all the horrible symptoms of menopause and it has changed me and my life completely...\nMeanwhile my Mom has formally been diagnosed with Alzheimer's any all my thoughts have been that is my direction in life as well...

I‚Äôm there & I have been for a while. I sought help now & I feel so much better. This is one of the best TED talks that I have heard._ This is literally the most valuable TED talk I‚Äôve ever seen! Thanks!_ Muy interesante!_ We spend so much time denying ourselves and our capabilities that when menepose hits we just give up or give in and just hate everybody._ Makes you not so forgiving. You REALLY FEEL IT instead of forgiving everyone's abuse. It's like estrogen makes you a pushover._ I'm convinced Drs are taught not to look at hormones so the could create all the meds made and sold to cover most of the symptoms created by hormone imbalances even intentionally pumping food an drinks with them to cause our demise and go looking for doctors help and then get us stuck in a medical prison._ Thank goodness this topic was brought  to us by a woman .  The  hot flashes starts in the brain.  \n\nHormonal  ageing  of the brain does happening.  Women need  a brain vitamin starting at 40._ Brilliant talk.

Ive been eating flax_ I've never heard someone contradict themselves so many times in one speech._ Right. It's like getting old is a taboo subject, unless, of course, there's a product or pill to push -- then there's plenty of information about the effects of aging and/or how to plan for and enjoy your \"golden years\"._ What a fantastic speaker focusing on a great topic that needs more attention._ Really excellent.

It's been roughly 8 months? Not entirely sure as my sense of time is a mess. Memory is mush. Depressed (have been for nearly 20 years) but that's manageable...

Moody (mostly irritable, I'm just unfairly irritated with everyone). and i have to feel like this for anywhere up to 10 years? I'm on my own with two teenagers. My elderly mum is starting to need me more, i try so hard to help but it does get overwhelming. i have a casual job which just barely pays the bills. I would do more hours if i didn't have nerve pain in my leg from a stupid bulging disc which i had surgery on 5 ish months ago. And i think my car is about to break down.  BUT I'M NOT CRAZY.  Everything else will be ok. I'll manage. i always do.  But it would be a bit easier if I could just get my goddamn mf brain back! And people will ask \"how are you feeling, you've been a bit grumpy lately\".  And I hate being goddamn grumpy! I'm not a grumpy person! I'm laid back, chill, no worries kind of person? WTF where did I go? Who am I? Why does everything suck gigantic balls??!!!  Rant over, for maybe around 5 minutes, if I remember what I did 5 minutes ago.

Women need HRT (hormonal reposition therapy) as soon as they begin getting peri-menopause symptoms, which can begin sometimes in their 30's. Get some extra education with brilliant women doctors like Erika Schwartz in New York, or Louise Newson in England. And stop comparing women with men, since this is not the point (except for stupid feminists). By the way, HRT can prevent cancer, Alzheimer, dementia, osteoporosis, among many other things._ @Petra I was going to say the same thing. I'm peri-menopausal and up til last year, had hot flashes. My doctor told me I was old and fat (true story). I went keto and those hot flashes went away, the joint pain all but vanished, and I'm also down 30 pounds! (Congrats to you on your success as well!) I don't know if I'll need HRT, but I am a firm believer that our diets definitely impact the way this happens to us as women._ Iam going to try_ I do Keto also but HRT can only be taken 10 years before the cancer risk doubles_ All that animal protein gonna dissolve your bones & make them brittle!_ @Madamegato¬† , your bones gonna pay the price eating all that animal protein!_ @ChristinaKM¬† , animal & dairy protein turns on cancer, as per Dr. T.

Gentle movement like yoga or dance were a wonderful release for me. It took some time to find out what worked. But in the end remember, this too shall pass._ Unfortunately I stopped menstruating at 37. I had no idea menopause was so close. So my insomnia, night sweats, dizziness, mental anxiety at 33 were due mostly to experiencing early peri menopause. I take hrt of course. Being post menopausal is weird, because I look 15-20 years younger than my age. I‚Äôm sure I won‚Äôt look young for MUCH longer, so that will be good to catch up to my peers. I feel a bit freakish and like an imposter when I‚Äôm naturally included in period conversations, because women think I‚Äôm in my late 20s. But no, I‚Äôm 44. And in a hormonal sense, I‚Äôm around 57_ I'm curious about the statement that our brain energy diminishes, after menopause, but cognitively we are just as \"sharp\". I wonder what this means? Are we sharp for shorter periods, and then tired? Do we simply need less \"brain energy\" to perform the same cognitive tasks as we did before, because our mature brain is taking short cuts or something? It's an interesting talk, but I'd like further information. Personally, I was highly intelligent in my younger years. I feel less so now, and it makes me sad that I can no longer enjoy thinking as I used to. But that could also be a case of losing it because not using it, I guess._ Wow this is one of the best and most helpful TED Talks I‚Äôve ever watched.

They have excellent brains. HOW COME?_ Came here in search for an explanation as to why part of my brain has stopped functioning. Now I understand it is due to the removal of my tubes and left ovary.

I have worked with pre-school kids for many years and as early as 12 mo. babies and toddlers tend to gravitate to different activities without anyone influencing them at the moment of choosing what to play with or how to express themselves. Boys are more aggressive they like to hit and push others for no reason at all without provocation they also choose more physical activities were as girls are more docile and for the most part like to hug and include others in their play or at least not mind others playing close by . Girls tend to do activities that are more focused based and less agitated. \nHormones make our brains think differently and act differently hence gender differences and preferences._ Thank you for your concern in informing us, I appreciate it._ Going through it as I watch._ This type of teaching should become part of brain injury rehab.  For women who become brain injured, either through: seizures, strokes, or traumatic brain injuries (TBIs), this information is crucial to know to help us learn how to deal with our injuries properly.  For instance, it is taught that the inside of your body ages 20 years automatically once the brain injury takes place.

Choose Mgtow üí™_ Women have more brain connections than men. Says everything!_ For me having menopause is not an issue. It's just a stage of life that we have to accept. In the early part of it there were hormonal imbalance that you have to go through like mood swings, hot flashes, insecurity but with time you get to accept it. Anyway,  everyone in your age feels the same way that you do. There is no exception. Acceptance is the key here,  no big deal._ I was given a choice.  The doctor told me I could have a cone but I chose to have everything taken out.  I am 74 but have been taking hormones with the blessing of the obgyn for thirty years with no complications. A natural medicine doctor told me I should not have had my ovaries removed. The obgyn, however, had told me not to let anybody tell me to stop taking the hormones.  He said I would be more likely to die of a heart attack if I didn‚Äôt take them than to die of cancer if I do._ Dr. Jordan Peterson says a woman is more interested in protecting her children while men are interested in themselves._ I kinda feel like a criminal who revisits a crime scene , because I‚Äôm done with the menopause , lol ...Keep this tucked in your memory banks while going through what I call  ‚ÄòThe Grande Final√®‚Äò after decades of menstruating every month of our life , minus pregnancies, though it‚Äôs definitely not an exciting Final√® , When it‚Äôs over, and it will end ,  we‚Äôre FREE for rest of our lives from the , Every  Single  Month  , pain and mess and it‚Äôs liberating ,,By the way , my mother tried talking me into an hysterectomy because I had such heavy periods caused by fibroids ,, I decided to try natural all the way , ( I always ask ‚Äò what did they used to do , concerning health issues) , So I asked my doctor ‚Äòwhat happens to the fibroids if I don‚Äôt get an hysterectomy , and my periods stop ? ‚Äò she answered , ‚Äò They dry up and the body absorbs them , they just disappear ‚Äò, So NO replacement hormone therapy and no hysterectomy ...keep your eye on the prize , Complete Freedom does come when it‚Äôs finally over for good !_ ‚ÄúBrains are not gendered‚Äù five seconds later ‚Äúthere is a big difference between men and women‚Äôs brains‚Äù_ there are more women then men_ Wow, that king of hit me in the face.

Well, I guess if I make it to dementia I will mean I beat the cancer odd.  Great._ 'you are not crazy' ! thank you for that :)_ We need practical solutions, because research like this is vital but when you go to your family doctor/general practitioner and no matter what you go to ask, they tell you to eat more healthily, exercise and lower your stress levels, at best it does nothing and more likely increases stress. It creates a disconnect between the doctor and patient, where there is a paternalistic relationship (regardless of gender of doctor) and they tell you off. TBH at times it feels like a form of victim blaming. And in relation to stress it is especially frustrating. If you are aware you are stressed to be told to reduce the stress in your life is banboozling, like ok, I‚Äôll just stop working, living in a world where there is oppression, caring for my kids etc. \n\nAnd again this research is great and needed!!!!

I get it that some of us might just need some validation for why we feel so tense when this stage starts.  But I want to tell you, after 50 has been the best time of MY ENTIRE LIFE!

This is very informative._ Excellent talk : )! Women have estrogen receptors all over our body like in the brain (and not just in the reproductive system), every where, even in our bone cells.

Thank you for sharing this vital information._ Menopause has been incredibly difficult for me--hot flashes, sleep issues, depression, anxiety, fatigue, headaches, just to name a few. Doctors are either clueless about it or just don't want to discuss it. When I bring it up, my concerns are dismissed, which feeds right into my feelings of inadequacy and depression! I do not want to take hormones due to the risks._ Oh wow_ I have had severe hot flashes for 32 years.  I have had to take HRT all that time.  Without HRT, I wouldn‚Äôt want to live; that‚Äôs how terrible the hot flashes are every time I try to stop the HRT.  I had to move north...to Maine...to be a bit more comfortable, but summertime is still a killer._ \"hormones differ between the genders\".  Really!  I thought it was between the sexes that hormones differ._ Nice information_ The fact that intelligetn women or people without any family connection are narcissist magnets could be useful to more employers Lisa Mosconi if employers would realize that in spite of needing to deal with more intreruptions in their work day they can then be taught to be taught to be such good salesmen or buyers of company raw materials while continuing to stay on top of constant interruptions like [I'm trying to be funny] for example when I was while watching videos this last half hour being interupted when seeing my aging computer shut down the video at the point when someone said the word smoke which then for some reason unsubscribed me from all of my You Tube Subscriptions including your channel Ted talks -- except my subscription to Fransiscan University. I wonder if that had anything to do with the of the construction along this street where I live to replace the grass along the boulevard too. Looks like I better save up money for a new computer nistead of another pair of shoes and purse to match that I don't need. For sure I don't want to buy a purse to go with my shoes that looks like a mirrored disco ball because then it might attract someone who isn't a rescuer at all and instead are looking for a target with enough cash to waste on another memory stick I don't need or whatever._ Starts with ‚Äúno difference between men and women brains‚Äù next says, now here‚Äôs how they‚Äôre different‚Äù_ I hate how nasty and angry I‚Äôve become since the menopause.

It's all the stuff you've swallowed through your life--how many times you've been nice and silent when you didn't agree/wanted to speak up._ The herbal supplement St.Johns Wort helped me with very chaotic mood swings since menopause.

Bc I just didn't find the resources I needed to build my confidence very quickly! Bless your heart for all your work! That validation is amazing!

Do your research, and see if it will work for you. And it is supposed to help with brain plaque. No carbs._ Try the full KETO diet. And cut out ALL CARBS!  No soy. Don‚Äôt believe the propaganda. Keto was developed for people with epilepsy about 60 years ago._ The work place, especially in stressful or busy roles is not compassionate to menopausal women. Their expectation is to perform just as a 25 year old. Ive been in a new job for 11 months and it's been tough learning. Nobody cares to understand what's going on with menopausal women, even women that have not reached that stage of life. Think more education needs to be out there so we can have more compassion._ This scared me at first but knowing that there are foods that can help made it a bit better. I was 26 when I had to have a full hysterectomy and can not take hormone replacement. I didn't get the hot flashes or other symptoms that most get either, why I don't know but no complaints. I love strawberries and all the foods she mentioned, thankfully. Thank you for this video._ SUGAR, is enemy number one for the brain ... and don't \"just\" think of sugar cubes, WHEAT transforms into sugar too, the Mediterranean diet picture she showed you is FAKE, Mediterranean diet is as FEW bread and pasta as possible, the Mediterranean diet is a Fish/chicken/pork meat diet with vegetables with lots of olive oil and mayonaise, why olive oil and mayonaise ? Well those are the fats your brain requires for energy,  there is nothing bad in home made mayonaise, it's eggs/oil/mustard, unlike in store bought mayonnaise where they ad tons of sugar as preservative to keep it longer on the shelves._ Great video! This woman is very knowledgeable and I can clearly understand her. I would like to see more from her. Thank you_ Thank you Lisa Mosconi - not only our brains, but the physiology is different between men and women (and ethnicity). Medical Blood test should be different also - who determines what \"Normal Levels\" are with so many factors of \"differences\" involved?

I wish more ladies would really talk about itü•∫ living with my mother while she was going through it was torturous and scaryüòí_ @tabbypanda82¬† - Well I‚Äôll be honest and say it wasn‚Äôt menopause yet. Though they say perimenopause the time before can be 10yrs of prep for one‚Äôs body. I think for me we‚Äôre just struggling in our marriage. Our kids have been distance learning for a year (teens) and we‚Äôre working from home. While there have been great things, it‚Äôs also a challenge navigating the emotions and uncertainty. On top of teen general and normal mood swings. Sorry about your Mom. I think too women mask things. Sometimes women are overwhelmed and depressed and can‚Äôt stop to think and sit with their feelings. Love to you. She was doing the best she could but I also acknowledge how painful that was for you._ @chebbiereadsandknits672¬† oh yes and to top it all off, she was an abusive alcoholic, it was extremely traumatic for my siblings and I ü•∫_ @chebbiereadsandknits672¬† we really thought that she was going out of her mind, angry, sad, fighting, drinking, oh my gosh the violence üò¶ü•∫I don‚Äôt understand what our mates/significant others are supposed to do with us when menopause hits.... I feel for anyone who has to endure what their wives/mothers Etc. are going through during menopause_ @tabbypanda82¬† - Do take hope that some have gone through non traumatic menopause. I think too if over your 30s-50s you are more self reflective, have healthy habits, get therapy as needed etc, maybe one can handle menopause better. It‚Äôs just like any other season. Yes it‚Äôs hard but if you‚Äôre going into it broken, then you‚Äôre ill equipped to handle or navigate it well. I don‚Äôt know your mother but I sense she has a lot going on prior. So since you can‚Äôt change the past, I‚Äôd say for you, what‚Äôs the positive takeaway? You don‚Äôt want to end up like she did. What internal work are you honestly doing now for you? How are you ensuring you‚Äôre healthy physically, emotionally, spiritually? So when menopause comes... also that‚Äôs not the only curve ball. There‚Äôs job loss, death, divorce etc. How are you remaining healthy, equipping yourself, growing etc so when life‚Äôs challenges come and they will, you‚Äôre in a better space?_ @chebbiereadsandknits672¬† I‚Äôm in therapy, she died last year in August_ @tabbypanda82¬† - I‚Äôm sorry to hear that and glad to hear you‚Äôre in therapy. Praying that you‚Äôll find the peace you seek. You‚Äôre on the right path._ @chebbiereadsandknits672¬† thank you. ‚ú®_ Excellent talk - women medicine should be evolving at a higher pace. Women should absolutely demand information like this. Most gynaecologists are still men. And yes this IS a subject that interests women, but it's disheartening to not find comments from men - it's like it doesn't concern them, yet every man has women in his life..._ Why does this show up in my recommendation ...yt knows something I don't know ? ü§îüòÖ_ Sleep....if only we could sleep like a man, life would be sweet!_ So, if stress is a big factor, then i can see where the beginnings of my troubles began. I know exactly when they began, and it's not getting any better......I don't get the hot flashes, i get freezing cold instead. I am becoming forgetful at times, and it frustrates me no end._ Great information...thank you.\nI was a little concerned that the focus was on oestrogen...progesterone was not even mentioned! \nDr John Lee, and Dr Jessie Hanley have shown the vital role progesterone plays on the body, and brain...and also is a precursor to a lot of other hormones.\nIt has been my experience using natural progesterone cream....that when I used it...my PMDD/PMS improved, I didn't get hot flushes, and my elevated prolactin (produced by the Pituitary gland) levels reduced dramatically.\nI think more study into the role of PROGESTERONE needs to be done, as well._ Madam,majority of we,ladies in Kerala are having menopause without hot flashes or insomnia.No observable decline in brain function. Psychologically more powerful in old ages compared to men.I don't know why. But it is my observation.I agree that it comprise only a limited gp._ No way, i'm smarter than ever and it's a fact !!!_ This is fascinating!!! Thank you._ Really poor quality research.   More women have alz than men?  Gosh might that be related to women living longer?  She assurmed you were so stupid you would not think of that.  How much else is she intentionally spinning?_ Very important information ... thanks a lot! ‚ô•Ô∏è_ Thank you so much for your work and introducing us to your findings, Lisa. Learning about our body is so valuable since very often we are \"written off\" as having mental health issues or simulants by our (mostly male) doctors. I started having symptoms in my early 40s and still at it now in my late 50s. It  seems so normal to me now that I forgot how life can be without them! I am hopeful though and look forward to better days whenever they may come. However, I must be honest, I am scared of Alzheimer's and Dementia since I have just lived through it caring for my late beloved Aunt for many years. ‚ù§_ Wholefood plant-based diet helps definitely._ Very Nice discorse!_ Lisa Mosconi is correct. I have been eating more of the Mediterranean Diet that Lisa talks about on this TED Talk. I have also been taking Estroven, approved by my OBGYN Surgeon, to avoid a hysterectomy, etc. My mood, energy and strength levels have been so much better. I sleep better, too. Having six to eight hours of sleep REALLY DOES make a difference to help with ALL of the above AND your mentality. My hot flashes AND night sweats are very minimal. I hope that a lot of my Womenfolk out there can practice this diet. In addition, adding more water consumption in your day helps, too. Cutting off fluids and foods three to four hours before you go to sleep makes a HUGE impact, as well. All Good Health and Blessings to All of Youüåπüíóüôèüíóüåπ_ I don't thing women are well-educated about menopause. After years of perimenopause that wasn't too bad, I certainly wasn't prepared for anything more than a few hot flashes.  It hit me like a ton of bricks with depression and anxiety like I'd NEVER experienced before.  I almost literally woke up one day and felt like a completely different person.  I couldn't function.  Not only do women need to understand what's going on and why this happens, but the men in our society need to be educated, too.  Too many of them still think women are simply \"crazy.\" They don't understand how powerful these hormones can be._ Funny how \"mosco\" invokes \"brain\" in slavic languages_ A few minutes into this video I felt so emotional and excited.

I'm jumping up and down!  Someone else here has read Dr John Lee!  PROGESTERONE! Yes!  Now if I could only get a frigging doctor or two to read his books. I had a ridiculous argument with my doctor about the importance of progesterone!  His reply - \"but I'm an expert\" (in prostate cancer! LOL) and \"I don't want to give you the treatment you want\" so he's no longer my doctor.\nI should have taken the book into the surgery just to show him the page with the hormonal cascades._ Hello, what is your diet? I did look up Kerala diet and what comes up appears very healthy no red meat. I was reading earlier that hot flashes are an American occurrence and was wondering why. It was a Harvard study._ I disagree with that also labeling anyone group is psychologically more powerful (which doesnt make sense) is a sure way to invite prejudice and non scientific normative statements which many men and women make that . Its like when science was used for long time to justify whites being superior to colored people_ Meera S.G. \nThis was a study done among women at a rural community in Kerala.\nResults: The mean age of attaining menopause was 48.26 years. Prevalence of symptoms among ladies were emotional problems (crying spells, depression, irritability) 90.7%, headache 72.9%, lethargy 65.4%, dysuria 58.9%, forgetfulness 57%, musculoskeletal problems (joint pain, muscle pain) 53.3%, sexual problems (decreased libido, dyspareunia) 31.8%, genital problems (itching, vaginal dryness) 9.3%, and changes in voice 8.4%. Only 22.4% of women knew the correct cause of menopause. Thus study stated that all the ladies were suffering from one or more number of menopausal symptoms. Ladies should be made aware of these symptoms, their causes and treatment respectively.\nSo you must be one of the lucky ones._ When your children are grown up, you have your brain back to yourself. üòÄ_ I have no children..

I had very bad periods while young with menorrhagia and terrible cramping that kept me home from school on bad days, I almost passed out from pain. I developed PCOS by 14. In my thirties to just the past few years I enjoyed a long period of time where my period came like clockwork and had a day of spotting, 2 or so days of bleeding then spotting, then over. Had an ectopic at 35.üòïNow my period is getting erratic. Had my first hot flash the other night and I‚Äôm not exaggerating, I felt like I was going to keel over. I had violent nausea, and motion sickness in my house. I started getting warm, the room was warm, then the sweat came. In minutes it was like a cup of water was dumped on my head. My headphones were soaked. I was shocked. I had to strip down to my undergarments and lay on my bed in front of my fan. The sweating stopped in like 15 mins, but the nausea, dizziness and fatigue took about 45 mins to pass. I was then freezing as the sweat dried. I also felt like vomiting and I couldn‚Äôt eat the dinner I had prepared. I was spotting when this happened, like my body was trying to have a period. I did get it for like a day. Now I‚Äôm actually scared. I cannot take ANY hormones due to a rare blood clotting disorder. I wasn‚Äôt allowed to take any birth control. Since that incident, I‚Äôve went out in the heat and gotten sick again. I haven‚Äôt felt right since. I feel like I have to lay in front of a fan constantly. I have fibromyalgia and some other health problems but this is out of the blue. I don‚Äôt know how to handle those episodes. I need to get a ‚Äúbag of tricks‚Äù together. Cold packs, Pepto, etc. Being a woman is over rated. I‚Äôm not complaining it‚Äôs just hard when you can‚Äôt take any HRT and things affect you so strongly. Great to know my brain function is going to suffer too.üòëI feel like I have a mild dementia already from diabetes. My Paternal Grandmother passed at nearly 93 yrs old in 2017. She had Alzheimer‚Äôs. It started slow, progressed over many years. She still knew who I was thankfully every time I visited her. My Aunt was her caregiver and did everything to keep her sharp and thankfully she stayed at her home but my Aunt went through so much as my Grandmother has sundowners syndrome and in the middle of the night would yell at my Aunt to take her home. It was more like spells of it that would come and go, but I noticed she forgot some people during visits and forgot what to do sometimes during tasks or games the family would play together, she was lucky to have my Aunt who gave 14 yrs. to live with her and take care of her. Sorry so long!_ I'm either late to the party or completely missed anything happening because my life can be emotionally hectic.

I wanted to know why All my joints hurt so much and came on so suddenly? I mean I couldn‚Äôt even sit Indian style anymore! 5 minutes in my left hip would be screaming! WTH! The Orthopedic Dr goes, ‚Äúyah, estrogen is the bodies natural anti-inflammatory, when those levels drop....‚Äù, Me: ‚ÄòWhatwasthat!, what? This is inflammation?!... Not Osteoarthritis?!... Oh no he says... your joints look good... look at these X-rays..Well, I was pissed, but really, I was more relieved! I can manage inflammation till my estrogen levels find there new norm. But what pissed me off was those other doctors never hinted at inflammation! WTH?! Live and learn. So to get to the point... it‚Äôs not a one pill fix. I have inflammation due to my drop in Estrogen so I take Meloxicam everyday to manage that for now. I take Amberan for hot flashes, works for me. Supplements like calcium, magnesium, omega-3, msm, iron, multi-vitamins & minerals & Vitamin D. D is important, our bodies use it to produce hormones, and that‚Äôs exactly what we get deficient in, as we get older. And finally... My memory... I don‚Äôt know if it will ever work the same. Stuff I learned, words I know, there all there, I just don‚Äôt have access on demand. Crying about it won‚Äôt help. I say the truth when I can‚Äôt recall or find the right word. ‚ÄúOh shoot, sorry my hard drive is malfunctioning‚Äù, or ‚ÄúOh shoot, short circuit, no  access‚Äù, life is easier with a good laugh. Oh yah!... I didn‚Äôt even get to the Thyroid. That goes wack too. I didn‚Äôt know that one! That‚Äôs another doozy. That sucker is responsible for a lot! That one I‚Äôm still working on to get back to normal range. I think that will help with fatigue and memory and new cell production, not sure till I get there. I guess that‚Äôs life for us dames...

I live a ketovore lifestyle. üëçüèª_ I had the most terrible menopause for about four years. I felt extreme nausea all day, all night everyday for years. I attended my GP several times with the perspiration running down my hair and body constantly. In the end my GP sent me to the hospital. When i got there one of the doctors set me up on a drip and told me the nausea would be gone in an hour. I didn't believe him, but he was right. The drip was finished by one hour and the nausea was gone, i was so relieved and thankful to him and to God. It was the most amazing feeling to be able to go home and eat dinner and enjoy it with no problem._ My Endocrinologist says he has made MORE THAN ONE GYNECOLOGIST üò° MADDD BCOZ they had a patient scheduled for hysterectomy but they were so overloaded, staff problems, vacations, etc they referred them temporarily to MY DR!! He made them ALL BETTER with NO SURGERY & they never had to have the surgery! Just as when my Thyroid messed up at 35 they killed it? At 50 I had to go back to him bcoz of probably partly the stress my husband caused at 35 then also 50?

Its the key to controlling insulin resistance and the key to controlling PCOS. \ngood luck._ This rare clotting disorder may involve the Leiden factor? Hunt for a doctor who will partner with you. Even with this disorder you could be taking some hormonal precursors and complement with phytoestrogens and other supplements. Go for HRT using ONLY creams or gels and your Leiden wont be a problem. However it is  hard to find a doctor that will be willing to prescribe because in the US they are all scared of litigation. In reality studies show the risk is only slightly higher. But since there no large studies most doctors leave you  to suffer_ @AK-ne4og¬† My familial bleeding disorder was discovered at John Hopkin‚Äôs University in my late maternal grandmother in the 1960‚Äôs by the late great Dr. Bell. I do have Factor V Leiden as well but my disorder involves fibrinogen and is extreme rare. I can take absolutely nothing that effects hormones. I couldn‚Äôt play gym in school.

Hope you tooüôÇ_ @jellybean6582¬† you make it sound so matter of fact and simple. Get educated. Hormone replacement brings its own truckload of problems: causing cancer, or reawakening dormant cancer, cells is just one.

Hormone replacement therapy, or HRT. Search youtube; you'll find Menopause Taylor and others for indepth info. \nPersonal testimony: It changed my life._ @jellybean6582¬† you seem insistent on appearing informed all the while you are leading people, who refuse to be self-informed, into the burning fire. Show me   one book that says ‚Äúhormone replacement is completely safe with no side effects, like cancer‚Äù. Just one. Find it. Otherwise, stop being a danger to women who might be feeling vulnerable. Hormone replacement isn‚Äôt like popping an aspirin for a headache. You. Are. Dangerous._ @LeeAnneG¬† One such book is ‚ÄúEstrogen Matters‚Äù by Avrum Bluming, MD and Carol Tavris, PhD. It‚Äôs fascinating and completely evidence based. All research is cited, so you can explore it for yourself, if you‚Äôre so inclined. It‚Äôs an engaging read, not boring. Dr Bluming is an oncologist of several decades, specializing in women with breast cancer. There are also interviews with both authors here on YouTube. \nOther great sources for menopause education are Dr Louise Newson, Dr Heather Hirsch, Dr Barbara Taylor. \nI have found that the most important thing for women is education, when it comes to menopause. We know so little (believe me!), and only if we are informed can we make decisions for what‚Äôs right for us individually. Knowledge is power! üòä\nGood luck on your journey._ @cm1906¬† yes üëçüèª dr Louise Newson has opened my eyes! I hope I will be well now üôèüèª_ I can't feel positive or do meditation too nervous_ I started menopause during Covid also and now I also have long Covid and right before Covid I had a few bad concussions on ranch also..

I'm thankful that I was paid for remote and could go through symptoms at home without commuting.  Even lost vision for minutes due to estrogen decline.  I was horrified but felt my way to kitchen to get water, went back to bed, cried, prayed and focused on my friend's words of drink lots of water and breathe.  I started taking DIM, Cordyceps, Ashwaghanda, Beetroot and amped up B-12 with IF (intermittent fasting) with as much Keto as possible. Thank you, Dr. Berg!_ Flaxseed, unfiltered oil and ground. Takes 3 weeks then I have been feeling great!_ Yes exercise people!!üòä_ ‚Äã¬†@irena9574¬† unfortunately how do you separate out the financial incentives by this doctor and the pharmaceutical industry selling hrt to millions of women and downplaying the risks? Even if there's less risk for cancer it still doesn't mean no risk.  Why risk it? Hard decisions and really don't know what's healthy. I do know that menopause is normal but our diets and lifestyle isn't. Changing my diet to whole food plant based made a huge difference. Stopping dairy especially cheese and eating more soy foods decreased and then ended my hot flushes (uk). I have no symptoms accept sleep disturbances around 3am and I've let my body get weaker which I'm putting right by going to the gym and walking more. Trying to stress less.... although not easy especially when making comments on YouTube ü§£ My 3 younger sisters are all on HRT and I'm not because I'm already 8+ years past last period and I didn't know 2 sisters were on HRT until they were already doing it for a few years. I'm aging in my skin but I do need to drink more water._ @jellybean6582¬† my friend took HRT and after was diagnosed with breast cancer and died within a year after her diagnosis._ @GraceDollesin¬† correlation isn't causation, millions of women do well on it, sorry to hear about your friend Grace_ Me too.\nTry HRT. This helped me a lot to get good sleep and improved ny long Covid (since 2 Years)‚Äã¬†@darcyirwin754_ @robin-gg2jj¬† that how I feel like  I am losing my mind. I feel suicidal. I am sleeping all the time._ Change your diet. You can't eat the same foods you ate in your 20's and 30's. Eat tofu and broccoli üòÖ_ Um, yes. This is a video about menopause- so why are you here?_ Go away misogynist. This is women‚Äôs business_ There is zero evidence that this has any effect. Zero. However there is much evidence that restrictive diets cause a great deal of anxiety and stress and those 2 things just make everything worse. Stop acting like changing something that literally requires a complete life change as infiltrates every aspect of your life is an easy fix._ @FortheBudgies she didn‚Äôt say it was an ‚Äúeasy fix‚Äù.  There are many studies that present evidence that gluten increases inflammation and can dramatically irritate certain autoimmune reactions, which definitely causes way more stress than following a diet. There are also studies that prove that the elimination of gluten improves gut health. Eliminating gluten can be helpful for some people. The problem with women‚Äôs health in our society is too many people look at it as one-size-fits-all approach. Women‚Äôs bodies are not all exactly alike. Eliminating gluten might help some women, yet it may not be appropriate for other women. In your comment you told @NatalieParker to ‚Äústop‚Äù doing what works for her.  That is a perfect example of how women are mistreated by society and the healthcare system.  If her approach is improving her health and well-being, why does that bother you? By sharing her good outcome, she may have helped other women too.  Just because you disagree doesn‚Äôt make her progress unworthy. I applaud her for taking positive steps to improve her health, wellness, and stress levels._ I believe your nutrition has to change as you get older sugar us also a culprit_ I've heard some women swear by the same change. Think I might give it a go._ @staciegulizia4144¬† that's so crazy that you say that because I've been going through \"the change\" forever. Now that I'm 50 it's even crazier. But what you said about every woman is different hit home for me because I try to explain to ppl other women how I'm feeling and how I'm not all there, and it feels like they discredit how I'm feeling. Saying things like you have to do this, you have to not think like this, or do this and all those things they say to do is what is actually hard to do. Staying focused, thinking positive, pushing through, and so many other things. Easy to say those things but when your brain isn't functioning the way it used to all that sounds like chatter! I have major depression and severe anxiety and when my hormones are all over the place it just makes it 10x's more. Even while on medication! I started perimenopause at 35. Thought I was going crazy then and here I'm feeling it again in waves. This thing is not one size fits all. The way I'm experiencing it is probably different from the way somebody else is. I feel like mine is severe at times where I have no control. I've always been health/exercise consciousand I try to do all the things that help. But sometimes even that doesn't compare! The waves when they come, they really come! I don't want to be around noone during those times, I feel incompetent and lost. Not focused at all. Everything seems harder than usual. Noone understand. I wish I could fly away to another universe until it's all over. üò≠ I hate it!_ @roneebooth9630¬† I‚Äôm so sorry to hear about your struggle. I can totally relate. I‚Äôm also so sorry you have been dismissed or shamed by other people. We all experience menopause differently. The management of our symptoms has to be addressed individually. I‚Äôve been asserting myself more when dealing with my doctors. I‚Äôve requested more blood tests to check my vitamin levels (D, B12, iron, etc) That has helped me adjust my supplements appropriately. Also, I‚Äôve learned that the ‚Äúfunctional‚Äù range for vitamin levels is very different from the range that doctors use as a diagnostic tool. For example, I function better when my vitamin D levels are between 60-80. But doctors are satisfied as long as the vit D level is 30 or above. That‚Äôs just one example of how I have treated my health issues with an individualistic approach. One size does not fit all. Keep up your quest for better health. You are worth it! Your concerns are valid!_ @mzyouknowit8024¬† sugar brings on hot flushes for me_ @staciegulizia4144¬† I'm in total agreement with you. I'm 57 this year and was diagnosed with SLE in my early 30s after my first pregnancy. Since then, I've been through 6 surgeries due to inflammation. I have greater health now than I ever did before after my ENT specialist (I had chronic sinusitis and went thru 2 surgeries) ran a good allergy test which confirmed that I'm highly reactive to dairy and gluten. Yes, the initial months were pure torture but when I persisted, the return of energy, mental clarity, lowering of physical inflammation in my tissues and joints made me feel like a new person. \nI am still on medications but at a homeopathic levels. I have the rare flares but recover quickly. And I explore the amazing range of natural, different foods out there. And yes, I now can have cheat days where I take gluten and dairy products 2x week._ Eating less carbohydrates, avoiding bread, pasta, sugars!, or keeping the intake really low, or just eating them every other day, helps to reduce sweating during menopause. For me having a low carb diethelped. Sports could help too , in order to burn carbs._ @FortheBudgies¬† wow. She said it helped her. It helped me too. Take your bad attitude somewhere else ._ Look into your adrenaline gland help. This is the gland that takes up making estrogen hormones after menopause. If this gland is healthy, your post-menopausal life should go smoothly as far as estrogen is concerned._ I had surgery they did hysterectomy and they put me on hormones which caused blood clots. Women\nGo through such horrible experience for being women with hormones._ Agree. I haven't had breast cancer but still don't want to do HRT due to risks._ I have uterine cancer and can't take hormones because my cancer is estrogen driven. I can't have soy (soy milk can help with menopause symptoms because it's an estrogen imitator.)_ And it simply doesn't work for some, like me! Although progesterone seems to be helping.... Time will tell._ exactly_ This!!! I am a bc survivor too and I am struggling with all the side effects. I wish there was a easy solution_ Me too but I need help - insomnia, anxiety, rollercoaster mood swings, digestive issues, headaches, night sweats and worst of all brain fog and loss of memory. I‚Äôm struggling to function at work._ @dannymeyer3256¬† have you noticed how male-centric it is & the research it relies on is? If men suffered 35 symptoms they'd resolve it. Pharma won't fund it unless they drug you & docs already push their pharma advice- birth control pills or antianxiety drugs!_ @ledacedar6253¬† You would think they would know some new ways of treating it. My daughter had a woman gynecologist and she was really helpful._ I also cannot have hrt .._ Very true! I'm sorry for what you've been through._ @cryptic1741¬† I don't want HRT either._ @Chezshay¬† You took it and it didn't work at all? That's interesting. I have not taken it and so curious about your comment. Can you share more please? How long did you take it? What did you experience?_ I can't take it because of migraines.\nI have melatonin supplements to help with insomnia._ Very good point! I took HRT and it wreaked havoc on my body. It caused me to have a radical hysterectomy and I developed a mass in my breast. HRT is not appropriate for all women._ @staciegulizia4144¬† It's really great for you to tell people like ME this. Yes, I do find going through is very hard, but I don't want to take anything for it. Cannabis helps me a lot._ Stop eating all animals, birds, fish, dairy products & oil & turn off cancer  for good.  As per Dr. T. Colin Campbell._ @Kaemea¬†   take Iodoral 12.5 tab daily, stop eating all animals, birds, fish, dairy products & oil & turn off cancer._ He hates us. Lol._ S_ she just proved her opening remark false, lol_ Hmmmmm... so the chromosomes and\nhormonal processes are not gendered?ü§£_ This was great and now can we get some information about what causes PCOS  ? This can be the next topic maybe. Many of us are suffering from PCOS unfortunately :(_ I think I‚Äôm coming out of menopause.   It‚Äôs been 6 years of absolute  yuk!    I‚Äôm starting to feel better.   Praying it‚Äôs over._ She lost credibility for me when she said mens‚Äô loss of testosterone was pretty much ‚Äúsymptom free‚Äù. Not even a joking matter. Good she mentioned diet and phytoestrogens! Women should stay far away from conventional cheeses and diary with added rbst and estrogen poison added to make cows produce more milk for profits. :(_ I could solve complex problem before my menopause started a few years ago. Now I get brain fog, I feel stupid. I stopped drinking a year ago and drink soya milk everyday now. It helps a lot and I have stopped using bioidentical hormone. but every time I feel stressed at work, I get hot flashes. I feel like giving up my career and do something simpler....  sigh also I have never been pregnant thus my menopause finished by 45. I could look 10yrs younger but my brain is different now...._ Ty!, for sharing such wonderful information and educational talk on women‚Äôs health_ I have 7 sisters I'm the youngest and neither of them ever taught me about periods and i guess i will have to approach them with my own questions about menopauseüòë_ i already went thru this and went thru the 4 years of hrt progesterone/estrogen. Still i had my questions and lack of information. Finallly after year 5 and a scare on my breast scan I went off all hormones. I am fine. It took a few months, no night sweats unless I drink too much wine or ate chocolate not too long before bed. I didnt want to mask it anymore. My body fat  shifted upward toward the middle of my body. Some things just are. One thing: dont think your body is like it was before, and dont try weird drastic diets, because your body cant take the stess of starving, or really fatty foods at night, stuff like that. You need to get in touch with your new body jsut like when you were a teenager and it changed one way, now its changing back_ I‚Äôm not sure I buy that there is no such thing as a gendered brain...aside from the obvious differences between boys and girls, men and women, there‚Äôs documented size differences between male and female brains. Then there‚Äôs this:\n\nhttps://stanmed.stanford.edu/2017spring/how-mens-and-womens-brains-are-different.html_ I definitely feel the transition. I worry sometimes I have althzeimers I'm 50 just and my brain is very slow._ I got menopause like symptoms from birthcontrol (inplanon) , i wonder whether that would also impact brain energy the same way as real menopause as both are because of lower estrogen levels._ I really agree and support the medical and nutritional advice to support women after the menopause detailed here. I am beginning to go through the menopause now. Just dealing with learning how to not just survive but also thrive through this experience is definitely an educational journey. I take calcium, magnesium, all the B vitamins, vitamin D, Co-enzyme Q10, vitamin C and make sure to eat eggs for breakfast every day, followed by a marmite (B12) drink. üòä‚úåüôè Having an egg for breakfast every day is nature's natural hormone replacement every day. Thank you chickens. üôèüòå‚úåüêî_ I went through menopause at 46 very minimal symptoms. I will tell you this when I was younger I was an egg donor I did research to see if that could‚Äôve been why I possibly went through menopause so young they said no but I think they need to look in that a bit further._ My mother had a hysterectomy when she was 39 years old, she died when she was 80 year old. She didn't have Dementia or anything like that._ I wonder if getting ones tubes tied also induced changes I had my done in late 30,s and almost straight away my thyroid stopped working correctly and I went into menopause.  If removing the womb has seen to effect us I'm sure tying our tubes is adding to this problem. I'd like to see this study extended to this area as under active thyroid is a worldwide issue for menopausal women_ How is her menopause finished at 51yo?_ I don‚Äôt think Mother Mature (should actually call it Father Nature since it has no sympathy for women) intended for women to live longer than their menopause since we are no longer useful in terms of reproduction.  After all, that‚Äôs all nature does is reproduce in order to stay alive. But for me, I believe getting rid of stress is our best bet. Stress doesn‚Äôt have to mean a fight, an argument, or something big.  The worst stress is the kind that is low grade and chronic and isn‚Äôt felt as strongly, so we live with it but don‚Äôt realize the damage it does slowly and insidiously on our organism. Think of what pisses you off the most and get rid of it. Don‚Äôt fix it, get rid of it. Fixing it is another form of stress since you now have to make extra efforts to adapt. Be true to yourself and also honest.  Know yourself and what you really need to make yourself happy._ So it‚Äôs official - we may be tired and have low brain energy but our cognitive abilities are unimpaired - we‚Äôre super beings . I am 52 and on Tibalone - without this synthetic HRT , I would be so sad and a chronic insomniac .

Lisa Mosconi was superb - is there a book ?_ Yes, it's just a social construct. These women should stop whining._ May I ask how old you are, please?

I had a hysterectomy at age 46 and it_ Made me go into menopause.   The hot flashes and emotional distress was horrific.

A good quality fish oil, vitamins \"A\", and \"E\" are important, as well as a good vitamin \"C\". I have taken Chlorella recently to help detox some of the chemicals (perfume scents), as my work environment caused an overload, resulting in scent sensitivities. The food we eat is also very important. Cut out anything with wheat, read labels, do research._ Lorraine and Jerdon Hewlett And what of the pesticides and herbicides in our food?_ Yes. Alzheimer's can also affect your spelling. üòÄ_ Could hysterectomy be the cause or be a starting point for when the ovaries are removed?

It is different that this happens to you when you should have been experiencing other things. But why are you making it about you are young and still looking good. It is not about how you look. It is about how you feel and that makes all the difference. It is about how you are capable to react, about feeling that you are on an emotional rollercoaster, about feeling so f%#*ing tired all the time, having no energy, not sleeping well, and reacting over emotional. And believe me, at that point, if you look good or not is the least of your worries. If this happens to you when you are young, it changes every prospective of how you thought your life would be. And again, if you are middle age, if this happens to you, it changes every prospective. It sucks_ I‚Äôm also suffering from surgical menopause. It‚Äôs the most debilitating thing I‚Äôve ever dealt with and to have to struggle with little to no help from the medical community is the worst._ No one told me any of the things that would happen to my body and brain from the surgery and the extreme menopause that followed.

If this happened to you, go on a very nutrient-dense diet of meat, fish, eggs, liver, goat cheese, and greens, to get back zinc, essential fatty acids, B vitamins, and more. You'll probably have a far better time with menopause, without taking even more hormones._ I feel for you & understand the impact. My heart goes out to you only being 43. I just turned 53 and the last 3 years have been extremely difficult. I feel like my cognitive issues are the worst thing to cope with. It affects me at work as I can't keep up & my company compares me with all the younger ladies. It causes pressure & stress which then causes a vicious circle with the hormones, affecting my brain function even more. I wish there was more understanding out there about how it affects us. I wish you well but just wanted to comment so you don't feel alone in all this üòä_ I'm sorry üôè_ Try HRT.

Definitely challenging, even with HRT._ I‚Äôm dealing with short term memory loss, hot flashes, aching joints, allergies, dry mouth, lack of sleep, loss of motivation, anxiety the list goes on and on and I seem to get a new symptom every week. I didn‚Äôt know my 50‚Äôs would be this difficult. I just can‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs kept such a secret from women. I felt unprepared as a result._ I am 41 and starte the change last year! Man it‚Äôs been rough! I did not expect to go through it this young‚Ä¶ im struggling but I‚Äôm learning how to get through this!_ It is a atrocity!!!! That is like castrating a male and not giving him testosterone!!!!! All because the media grabbed a hold of a sound bite that estrogen replacement causes breast cancer. The placebo group had 6 cases of breast cancer out of 10,000 women and the hormone therapy group had 8 extra cases out of 10,000!!!! The study was flawed and please do your research ladies!!!

Only 36 now. Still finding it hard . It can be very isolating when young no one talks about it . Plus I have forced periods by Hrt which causes more PM's symptoms than before . All I can suggest is talk to friends because in my experience doctors are just non empathetic at all._ I think the only symptom I've had is that my memory has gotten drastically worse and I have trouble multi-tasking, which I used to be really good at. No physical symptoms or mood problems though. My periods stopped about 3 or 4 years ago at about age 54._ @beth1776¬† no I was always a reasonably heavy bleeder, 5-6 days some pain at first.

Yay....only a few hot flushes and some weight gain._ Same---I stopped menstruating two years ago...was a widow but recently remarried to a man five years younger and now I'm looking forward to a long married life with my chosen mate. No menopause symptoms at 53..yet?   I read once that a lot of us women will mirror our mother's menopausal experience. I do not recall my mother going through anything extreme during her menopause. Good for you, Samantha, by the way!_ Samantha Jane .what is your diet like?And what are the elements of stress in your life?_ @Lafeolamom¬† This happened to me at 38/39 and was period free and postmenopausal for a year by the age of 44! I was heartbroken. I am now 50, 51 in August, and still struggle greatly with insomnia and worse of all osteoarthritis and joint pain due to plummeting Ostrogen levels. I decided not to go on HRT for health reasons but perhaps wish I had now to protect my bones and my heart health!

Am going crazy at 52._ Like Samantha I too had a very easy menopause. At 49 the periods stopped. No hot flashes or anything. I started doing Yoga at 41. From a book called RICHARD HITTLEMAN‚Äôs YOGA 28 DAY EXERCISE PLAN. I think yoga went a long way in making it all easy_ Nice.  I'm hoping for the same when the time comes_ @AsYouLikeIt_Zendi21¬† my diet is ok. I always try to eat well but I know I eat too much sugar at times. I dont usually sleep that much but my stress levels are a bit high with dealing with a teenage daughter going through her stuff.

Both great for helping the body to work efficiently_ @Lynda Maddison awful! Sorry to hear thatüòî_ @chee60¬† hair loss is not a menopause symptom, more likely thyroid. Get checked, and even if it is  \"normal\" range, you can still have symptoms. Get t4 and t3 levels checked. Great website hypothyroidmom.com._ @Lafeolamom¬† have your thyroid checked._ Liz Feola i went through it at 42. With no symptoms. Got my first hot flash at 50. But the mental stuff is strong._ Wow lucky they suck_ @Lafeolamom¬† same. I'm 51 now but started menopause at 41 with every single symptom and it's still going. Bio identical hormones have helped to a degree but not 100%. Sleeping through a whole night is still impossible even though I'm exhausted pretty much all the time._ Lucky! I had an anxiety attack that lasted 2 freaking weeks! THANK GOD it went away...so far it's not come back! crosses fingers_ Samantha I‚Äôm the same. 53 and periods stopped last year. No symptoms.  Although I‚Äôm a bit irritable for no real reason now and then. I wish you well._ @chee60¬† hi. You may already know this - i had severe hair loss at the age of 41. Researched and taking biotin tablets (started with 5000 now taking 10000 mg) saved a lot. Have been taking them for the past 7 years once a every day with no side effects. I also stopped dying my hair using henna  for the last 3 years. I add olive oil and egg , leave it over night which really helps ( I'm going through menopause too). Saying that hopefully it will continue in this way for some time. Worth to try and I hope this helps üòä_ @Lafeolamom¬† do you have kids? they say that can happen if you never had children. I've always been worried about this myself_ @Lafeolamom¬† Hi..just wondering if you eat all the foods they recommended in the vid. Do things like this actually help? Sorry if you're not at  the menopause stage...I was just wondering if you were._ @snoopsie¬† i do have 3 kids._ @snoopsie¬† honestly I have tried all kinds of diets. I am currently doing intermittent fasting with the autoimmune diet. But I still am having issues.  My latest is insomnia. I wake up in the middle of the night terrified. I hate it._ @Lafeolamom¬† terrified? Is that a symptom? I''m not sure if I\"m going through peri-menopause yet but I keep waking up in the middle of the night as well. Ugh. Is the diet helping at all though? Even a little?_ @snoopsie¬† the diet has helped me a bit. I kinda deflated if that makes any sense?  It‚Äôs almost like I was swollen. Insomnia is common for menopause\nSo is anxiety. I think it‚Äôs causing panic in me._ @Lafeolamom¬† Oh man...that doesn't sound comfortable at all. I hope they invent something soon that will ease all symptoms ...HRT just sounds so dangerous anyway_ Probably not yet but in the future it is still possible_ @sampuatisamuel9785¬† still none and periods completely gone now!

I was shocked to find out that a symptom free menopause does not reduce the risks associated with menopause (that is alzheimer's, osteopetrosis and heat attack). Estrogen is responsible for so many things. There is a lot that can be done. Enjoy Dr Taylor education x_ Well arent u lucky gbu_ Congrats..üëçüôÇ_ You‚Äôll eventually get symptoms.  I didn‚Äôt get symptoms right away but eventually I started to feel the symptoms it was slow and  gradual.  I started using bio identical hormone replacement and I feel better._ You're so lucky!_ It is all ahead of you_ @estherroberts3537¬† only 2 periods since my original post, and still no symptoms, I've  never been happier! \nI do believe my clean living is the key. No red meat, tofu, lots of greens and out in nature everyday.\nI feel blessed!üíñ_ @Lafeolamom¬† have you tried antidepressants???_ Don't speak too soon. I thought that too at 57. Then got hot flushes. However, I just cooled down with drinks from fridge. Ironing in the night made me tired. I got through it. Lasted 3 months. Swam in sea too, cold showers. Fine now, still 57. I think it's important not to get stressed as she says, and not worry too much about symptoms, just choose natural remedies cures. I was coming out of lockdown surrounded by men in the house. Husband and sons. Not easy. I fy exercise was best help. Walking in nature and swim in sea. Gardening, talking to birds, animals._ @db8134¬† Im 55 now and I still haven't experienced a hot flush. I have learned my mother never did either, so is more to do with genes and I have spoken to women who also never experienced it. My doctor says its more to do with thyroid issues. I have been a little emotional but that also can be contributed to recent experiences more than hormones. Im working on building oestrogen with positive relationships and self love. Im also dating and looking for a good partner ü•∞\nI live in nature everyday as I grow and sell plants at my house for a living, so I guess that would definitely help. Im a natural healer so I rely on natural methods for health_ I hope your input and mine will help others. You are obviously someone in touch with yourself. So important. I'm a working progress. I've stopped looking for happiness. I'm now looking at my heart and doing what I can do, no more. If I can help I do. If I can't I say no. Trying to live more simply. It's much easier, even when busy. If people are looking for a fight, I don't let them. I say fine, you must be right. They find out the truth anyway. I don't have to prove anything. That just causes stress. Lovely talking with you._ @db8134¬† lovely talking to you too, and I do hope we can help others with our shared experiences. We are all different and have different needs but every little bit of information can help us understand our bodies better and strife for a more natural and healthy life. All the best to you too and I hope you find peace and happiness  ‚ù§_ @Kaalokalawaia¬† give up coffee_ Am so jealous!üòÅ_ @LJ Bless your heart üíú_ @db8134¬† This is awesome üëèüèΩ!

Good health also is important.  I have no health issues but  I do have some mild asthma due to living in high pollen count area_ About to turn 50 and have had minimal issues so far: a couple of short cycles of hot flashes, definitely some brain fog and forgetfulness. But nothing debilitating. My mum had a low drama menopause as well. And I‚Äôve never been very hormonally volatile‚Ä¶ so far so good, I guess. I do hope I get to keep my marbles lol._ @snoopsie¬† fwiw, HRT is not dangerous *at all*, if you‚Äôve no counter-indicative problems and are cleared for it. I just went on it last month and am kicking myself did not doing it earlier._ @chee60¬† hair loss is due to menopause_ Anyone hre is a menopausal virgin_ @burnerinsyd¬† Only stay on Biological Hormones for no more than 5 years, afterthat they can cause cancer, that is what my biological treatment Dr said._ So good to hear.

(which type of hrt would you think appropriate if so?).  Thank you  . . ._ All of you saying you have no symptoms need to read Dr. Mary Claire Haver's book about menopause. We're taught about hot flashes and other symptoms, but you may not know the secret deadly ones! You lose up to 30% of your bone density in one year of menopause, loss of estrogen causes heart disease, urinary tract and bladder issues. Did you listen to the Ted talk about changes in your brain at all? Trust me, you're not special. Your body is definitely going through menopause._ Yay for you.

It's time that women are told it might not be something to dread. For me it was the most liberating thing. No more swollen breasts, days of irritation and mood swings. I wish it had happened sooner._ This was very informative.  \n\nI started going through menopause a few years but wasn't diagnosed until last year. It started with rapid weight gain and bladder issues. I had a partial hysterectomy at 35 so of course no period to base it on. I also kept waiting on the dreaded hot flashes,  but never had a problem with that. I finally talked with a friend of mine who is a nurse since I'm in my mid 50s. And one of the questions she asked me was if I was having memory issues. I had been scared because my dad has dementia and my grandfather had alzheimers. She explained that mommy brain was more like hormone brain since it also was part of menopause. I'm very grateful that I'm having mild symptoms and not taking medication for it._ Thank you, that explains a lot._ I keep hearing noodles in stead of neurons :)_ I drink cummen boiling water,few amount of all types of almonds, dryied fruits,alot alot of water ,lemons diluted juice,also Greene fresh paper with cucumbers help alot to immunity, for the period I drank too much of dryied bardigoush,teah not tea (I don't there names in english excuses me._ Italian culture & cuisine act as brain health providers.

A lot of doctors know nothing about the symptoms of menopause._ Yes...most if not all symptoms eventually fade.  There is the occasional hot flash (once every few months), but I made it thru and life is good on the other side of the \"menapause mess\".

In that case, the hormones might have saved your life indirectly._ Maria Castillo Badass is good. That‚Äôs the advantage of not having the excessive amount of hormones you needed to get pregnant.

Flaxseed (grounded) might help with night sweats.  Coconut oil for dry garden.  Dry skin - I soak in the tub with Epsom salt and use cleansing oil for washing. Adaptogen herbs (Holy Basil, Ashwagndha, Maca, Rhodiola are a few) might also be an option...CONSULT YOUR DR AND DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH ABOUT THESE AND WHAT THEY DO.  Hang in there ladies.

I've found two impactful resources: Suzane Sommers book, Ageless, The Naked Truth About Bioidentical Hormones, and YouTubes Menopause Taylor. Suzanne Sommers is actually quite brilliant and has done myriads of research and her books are ingenious. Dr. Taylor is a retired OB/GYN who educates on menopause and HRT. üòä_ @Diana-tf5xq¬† then get more up to date information_ @Caroline1261¬† how long did they take to work.had patches now for just over 2 weeks.working on my sleep and hot flushes.still get low mood and anxiety?_ @amandathomas2272¬† It takes longer than two weeks.  I also had to take an antidepressant.  I still have hot flashes (I'm 60, so 10 years of them so far).  Anxiety should be treated with another medication.  It's complicated.  You have to talk with your doctor, preferable a female doctor over 60.  Good luck_ @Caroline1261¬† thank you_ @wolfgirlie¬† Happened to me, until I researched it myself and got off the antidepressants, and got on HRT with bio-identical replacements._ JJ, please look up information about HRT, specifically how menopause leads to whole slew of diseases due to lack of estrogen and progesteron, even testosteron in menopausal women. The study doctors keep referring to when talking about HRT causing cancer has been debunked, and even corrected by the original authors. Also today's bio-identical hormones are much better at doing it's job. Don't just give up. Look up Menopause Dr on Youtube, you'll learn a lot. Good luck!_ Me2_ I understand how you feel. Don't give up!

I have ADHD and it is because of that disorder that going on hormones is so important because keeping estrogen stable is very important for my medication to work consistently. Ignoring the roll of estrogen on mood is very ignorant of doctors, but they do it all the time._ @user82963ty¬† probably no but it helps me._ @sweetsugarjones¬† You can prevent postmenopausal bleeding by using Progesterone.

You are not alone x_ @Diana-tf5xq¬† the study is extremely outdated and unless you have a history of breast cancer in your family, the odds are very slim to none.  60 minutes did a great educational piece on it and changed my mind about HRT.  My hot flashes were making me miserable and embarassed as I always thought someone could smell the sweat from me.  I have been on HRT for approx. 3 weeks and the hot flashes have dissipated immensely.   Knowledge is power.  I am so happy I did more research and did not accept an old study from many years ago._ No, no, this isn‚Äôt just the way we are created. Much of this is diet-based. Try lowering your carbs to about 50 grams a day, lower if necessary and really reduce sugar. You‚Äôll feel better._ @sladjanasimic5486¬† Thank you! So much of this is diet-based since the average diet is way too high in sugar and other carbs. I‚Äôm hesitant to recommend hormones because our hormone levels change for a reason.

They diagnosed me as 'depressed' then 'psychotic,' none of which I was. It turned out I am ES - electrosensitive due to EMFs. This was the real cause of my problems. I ended up treating myself entirely but sadly not before I was sectioned as I refused to take their nasty drugs which caused severe side effects. I have to be \nreally careful regarding WIFI especially connected to mobile phones . It affects my brain  if over used. EMFs today are serious  hormone disruptors and women are especially vulnerable I have been told personally by a scientific expert,  due to their complex hormones. This is entirely overlooked by the so called 'doctors' mentioned above. They always concentrate on the mind and any mental illness label they can hang on women. Absolutely appalling! Natural medicines/therapies are best. Avoid drugs. What I have to say about those dreadful disgusting quack pharma doctors is unprintable. EMF s affect the brain  mainly and are leading to electrosensitive people especially women being locked up by ignorant so called 'health professionals'. Be aware._ the right HRT will help you hun you don't need to vbe going through this, you sound like I was but there is help go see a female doctor or female clinic don't suffer it can last 10 yrs and with no help it changes us into different people that are so unhappy.

I am 74 yrs now and doing well.  Please get help asap._ Have you changed your diet? Cut out carbs? Cut out sugar? Cut out coffee? Cut out alcohol?  Have you stopped putting crap on your body like skincare, make-up, perfume, toxic shampoos etc? All of these affect hormones. Every woman I know who is having  a hard time with menopause can't be bothered doing any of the above and then they have the hide to tell me I am so lucky that menopause has been the most wonderful time of my life.

Your body changes and so does your mind. Worrying about it is not going to make it better. You can actually be more heath and energetic after meanpause! You can see it as very one else says it is, or you can make it your own experience and change and love your body and your time in it!  -I know some who choose to see it differently, not the end but the beginning!

I had 25 fibroids and other benign tumours (I looked 5 months pregnant). They disappeared on their own. They shrink. Simple as. Over the space of 18 monts, I had a scan, it revealed all the tumours, the consultant (a man) wanted a hysterectomy for me, I refused, I got an MRI to prepare for another procedure. By then, only one fibroid was visible! The consultant thought the machine was faulty. So I had a procedure where they use a camera to look inside your body - horrible btw - and lo and behold, a tiny fibroid left. I've never taken hormone replacements, no 'natural' remedy, nothing._ It's different for each individual. I ignored my Dr.s advice being totally against surgery. My fibroids kept growing regardless of all the changes I made with diet, exercise and supplements. Seven years later the decision was made for me when I ended up in the emergency room with a blood clot that traveled to my left lung and right leg, I had to have a hysterectomy._ Please look at a book called \"Healing Fibroids\". The male doctor who wrote this book around 2002 claims that women who suffer from problematic fibroids are dealing with unresolved negative rape trauma stress. You must reduce, eliminate, and confront your negative stress factors. This includes proper rest, exercise, and food. Unfortunately, if a sensitive/empathetic female eats food from unhappy animals (CAFO raised meat and dairy) you are more likely to develop problem fibroids. Sometimes, even eating food from pasture raised animals can be problematic. The safest and cheapest way for you to reduce your fibroids is to eat plant food you grow yourself, buy from an organic CSA/ISA, a trustworthy organic farmer's market vendor, or neighbor who grows organic GMO free plant food. Please drink only filtered water from glass cups/bottles not plastic. Some women feel such a strict vegan diet is too hard for them and they choose for myomectomy which has a 90% success rate and will not kick you into early menopause. It is preferred over hysterectomy. Sometimes even a female OB/GYN will recommend unneccessary hysterectomy. Always get a second or third opinion!  Myomectomy will leave your ovaries intact. It is also for women who want to get pregnant in the future._ I should try that thank you_ I‚Äôll try that too, thanks for the tip!_ Cafe' Brasileiro..Maca is really helpful...helps to bring the entire endocrine system into balance, without containing hormones._ Links to products you trust?_ @barbg1023¬†..would call your local health food store and get a \"standardized\" , formula.

Life expectancy has little to do with it_ And you men are most likely to be dead as you lot die a lot younger than women._ Why?_ I understood this as female and male brains being the same in the beginning but our reproductive organs affect the brains eventually due to hormone changes as we age.

What I'm finding is that I'm able to tolerate cold a lot better than before.

She will help you work out what to do. Enjoy x_ Good on you Alessio for your curiosity and care for your mum._ I don‚Äôt understand why there are so many   praising comments. What she is actually doing is giving a reason to not only discriminate women by gender but also and by age. She is saying to business leaders, that ALL women close to menopause will experience energy decline, will be tired, thus not worth promoting, giving funding for their startups. I would like to know how many brain scans she has done to make such a conclusion and put a ‚Äúlow brain energy label‚Äù on ALL women in their 40ties. I also would like to know who have funded this research and who will push to women their products to help their brain energy. This is absolutely not ethical to compare brain scans of Women and Men and give such conclusion without razor sharp 1st level evidence._ I have seen my mom changes in behaviour because of menopause...i always advice her to do yoga..._ Eat coconut oil and meditate. My Mom had absolutely no symptoms of Menopause._ women and mens brains are the same except when they are not. uhmmmm?_ Nice. You contradict yourself from the start and just get more insane and irrational from there.

We all suffer ladies and men lets be on each otherside sides. My mother is suffering from menopause im trying to be always comforting her through this little storm_ Is this an elaborate strategy to sell hormone pills?_ This scientist has not been watching the science guy on TV or aware of the more recent academic and social scientists research about the \"truth\" that there is NO gender differences. She is unaware that the media has disproved the myth of menopause, everyone knows it is only social programing and NOT  physical. She NEEDS to be \"woke\" up. Does she really expect people to believe her when the media and academia say differently?_ We need a TED talk on how menopause affects women's husbands!_ I love how most of the scientific world that deals with brains counters her. Not to mention that she is basically being a bigot against transpeople right now._ Wonderful talk. But why do women think they are going crazy when they experience menopause? I think it's because women's experiences are not talked about in society, the subject is almost taboo in mixed company. While we hear about men and their experiences all the time, women's experiences have been stuffed into a box that fits the male model. Men don't have menopause so that's not something that mixed company will traverse. Science, finance, education, history (his-story), religion - the entire enchilada is male-defined and women have no definitions of our own because all our learning comes from the male brain and experience only and women have adopted this framework and still haven't even looked to see if theirs could be different and most likely better. Why do I say this? Because women are not as frenzied and violent as men. When I say this I am talking about the overwhelming majority, there are always exceptions but there is no point in concentrating on exceptions as it doesn't give a clear picture. Lisa Mosconi explained this very well._ Muchas gracias por su excelente trabajo üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª_ Thank you, Lisa!_ Very nice and clear presentation.

I am not suspecting this is due to autonomic nervous dysfunction, which in turn is due to drop in estrogen. No doctor is willing to listen._ It is very possible you are starting menopause. My hot flashes started at 41, and my periods became irregular when I was 43. I haven't had a period since I was 47. Go to a gynaecologist and get a test for your hormone levels. In the US I have seen home  test kits for menopause at drug stores, but don't know how accurate they are. There is no need to suffer and HRT really can help._ She can get her hormone levels checked and trial the bioidentical hormones.  Most women don't understand how this can help.  Here is a great position statement from the North American Menopause Society.

So, what do You think would be the point? Honestly?_ @manfredschmalbach9023¬† The point is so women don't think  they're crazy for just going through normal life passages. The point is understanding. There is very little understanding of balance because it's only ever been men and now women are even less feminine, they are almost totally subsumed by the toxic masculine which is rife in our society. Dominance - that's the way society runs and hierarchy. This is a sickness of the mind because everyone is equally important. I am not \"blaming\" men or anything, just pointing out observations which are pretty much \"in your face\" everyday. But women are silent and now it's up to them to speak up._ @deniseward002¬†\nYou keep contradicting yourself._ @deniseward002¬† You did not answer my honest question. Did You understand what I was asking?_ @manfredschmalbach9023¬† No you didn't read my answer._ @bilalshafique5898¬† That's a great line -  you make a claim but say nothing about it at all and give no idea what you're talking about._ I agree edcrin heath is more important than most people understand_ Important research.

Person could tell me what the implications are for those who are born as female but transition to male in their late teens (female to male transgender) and What about women who take testosterone for muscle growth? The effects of hormones on these two types of people remain unclear. If anyone has any info please reply!_ Seems like now at TED talks your first statement has to be one of leftist ideology. There are no differences between male and female brains, yet here are a few differences. Is this the Onion?_ Another Ted talk in which a woman thinks long and hard about her vagina. Shocking._ I had a full hysterectomy when I was 34. This is extremely scary and depressing. I'm on medication to give me the hormones_ I hope to educate others on this on my channel!! We need to reach out_ Excellent_ In the beginning she said there is no difference between men's and women's brain, and explained the difference in the rest of the video._ I'm just 25 years old and I actually have lost my period recently due to high stress! and most of those menopause symptoms apply to me! This just shows that stress is so serious and we all should try to help each other not to have such stressfull life! So I advice everyone who feel stressed to find something to recuse your stress! Because if what Lisas says is true then there is a possibility that high level of stress during your younger years can contribute to a higher chance of dementia in the future!_ Soy or edamame has phytoestrogens too._ Women and men have very different brains. I‚Äôve read entire books that prove this. Men have more white matter and less gray matter. Women are the other way around. Hormones are huge too. But , in general, there is a women‚Äôs brain and a men‚Äôs brain._ She really wasn't expecting it, üòÇ_ The effect is even seen in MONKEYS who aren‚Äôt socialized the way that humans are_ How did you arrive at this conclusion?_ Have to disagree from my own personal experience_ Simply not true. Read 'Delusions of Gender' by Cordelia Fine._ She meant like the size of certain regions and inherent aptitude for certain tasks or interests._ @elisec9530¬† ... when there are differences enough to go at those for hasty, superficial 13 minutes straight and not go deeper as \"it's endocrinal, Ya know\", then her ridiculous pc statement about the gendered brains which she claims were not there is nothing else than a preface the professional genderbenders, wahmin-studies-nonscientists and cultural marxists had to be stuffed with, even if everybody in his right mind does know how that's a hollow-flat-earth trope._ @elisec9530¬†\nI mean, while it's true that there are structural differences, they don't mean much.\n\nEnvironment and genetics play an important role._ And both statements are correct. Gender is a social construct. History tells us this. Male/female is biology._ If you have ovaries, you will have estrogen.  I am guessing that you have an estrogen suppressor drug?  possibly?  Do you have the estrogen levels checked?  Even men can't go to zero levels of estrogen.  I am not an expert, but this is a great question for your doctor.  I did have a hormone class and we did a week on transgender.  I don't think the long term complications of hormone therapies are known yet.  Testosterone can convert to estrogen, so maybe that has you covered.  Sorry, I am just guessing here._ @kathrynanderson2737¬† yes I understand that I will always have SOME estrogen. I guess I technically have an estrogen \"blocker\" as I have testosterone gel that is applied transdermal (soaks into the body) and its my understanding that (??) as testosterone rises estrogen falls in response.\nHonestly my doctors have about as much clue as anyone lol. Thanks for your response. The course you took sounds really interesting!!  Wow its good to know that trans was a part of your education on this._ @princeofb7383¬† Yes.  The class was called Psychology:  Hormones and Behavior.  Beautiful course with many progressive ideas.  Our hormones will modulate but not control our behavior.  You probably know by now that your Tgel will rev up attraction to a mate -- it is also a pain reliever and helps with ADD attention issues.  So many functions in the body._ Hi Amanda my aunt weren't through menopause early and complained of mood swings. She started excercising, changed her diet, mainly avoiding everything soy and sugar. More plant based and it really helped. 20 plus years later she's early 60s and looks and feels amazing._ @Oz Lang It's not too late to start hormones.  You would have to find a progressive doctor.  Maybe an antiaging doc._ OMG! Full histerectomy?\nAnd do you still trust doctors??? üôâ_ @hunorka11¬† why not?Does she have options?_ @justinamusyoka4986¬†, \nYes, of course! \nFinding the cause of your illness, resolving and healing.\nMutilation of the body is not a cure._ Amanda Walker I was 24 when i had a hysterectomy. I did not take hormones until I was in my mid-thirties which I tried  bioidentical hormones for years. I had success for years however; they are expensive. In my forties, I had reaction to bioidentical hormones so I went on premarin. I have been on premarin about 4 yrs. I am doing good with it. I tried once to stop it and it was a flood of symptoms plus I started growing a beard that men would be jealous of. Lol. I am back on premarin. I do find that exercise, diet, stress management and sleep are extremely important. There is no playing small in menopause. We must do incredible self-care. We have to put ourselves first or we will melt. I take it as a life lesson to learn to love and care for myself._ @hunorka11¬† That is misleading to say that no woman needs a hysterectomy. I had to have one because of cancer._ @carin, Ovarian cancer is caused by a loss of conflict. (loss of living being)\nI think you live in America, and Dr. Hamer's science isn't very well known there.\nI am lucky here in Europe because I know this science and so I was able to rid myself of 2 cancers. So I didn‚Äôt have to suffer severely from medical staff.ü§ó_ @miamichaels5999¬†, There is a real solution to cancer, but it is not surgery!\nThe real cause is in the psyche, in a psychic conflict, if I resolve it, healing will happen automatically according to the order of nature._ @hunorka11¬†nope, I don't trust doctors at all anymore._ I had stage 4 colon cancer at 34. Chemo and radiation cooked my female partsü§£ Anyway I went through menopause then. My memory sucks, but that can be from chemo also. At 49 I started hormones because I have bad osteoporosis and keep breaking bones. I am not complaining because I am alive._ I am no expert but if I can give you some advice that cost me lots of money. I too had my uterus removed at 42 thought I was dying 5 doctors later found a very good doctor. All he told was to give up sugar and carbs  very hard but you can do it. Exercise at least walking every day put me on vitamins. It changed my life lost 25 pds. Don't know what a hot flash feels like. I am 52. Go to a doctor that will listen to you. Good luck!!_ @hunorka11¬† hey, I had a hysterectomy and one ovary removed when I was 33 due to adhesions and rampant endometriosis. I'd had horrible, debilitating pain for years and was so grateful and thrilled to find a doctor who took my pain seriously and had a solution. Doesn't mean I trust all doctors, but that one doctor probably saved my sanity._ Don¬¥t worry too much, dear Amanda, I have a relative who had hysterectomy at age 30. She is 81 now, bright and happy, publishes books and has  exhibitions of her paintings._ I didn‚Äôt need to hear this either! I had full hysterectomy at 55 and am now 60. I‚Äôm seeing a decline in memory BUT I‚Äôm over stressed and also read this could be the reason for forgetfulness. I tend to think on the positive side so I will keep with that and work on the stress. Fingers crossed!_ Me too. I‚Äôm 47 now and a mess_ 0:42 are you ok? She literally says that all brains are BUILT the same.  And then explains how they may function or respond to certain hormones differently. Please, learn to listen to what people are saying._ Oh sweetheart when I was 25 same thing - but here I am at 52, still having periods and birthed a few kids too - so your periods will return , but you might need to help yourself some like I did - I had to add healthy fats into my diet ( during that era it was no fat ) I was too thin and no fats - try adding Cod Liver Oil , flax and walnuts - watch your periods come right back ü§∏ Ug, now I'm 52 and I'm so dam sick of periods - enough already , let me be an old lady - lol !

I didn't mind the late \"pause\" because, in my opinion, it's helped me to retain something of a more youthful appearance._ pshkd jdbd Estroven is one of the over the counter pills and they somewhat work -- they did not work that well for me. I am 67 now. For trouble with sleeping I use L-Tryptophane which you can get at a health food store and Melatonin which you can buy at Walmart. I have found drinking a cup of chamomile and lavender tea taken with the two supplements help me to get to sleep. But I will play solitaire on the computer until my mind is very tired or Woody or another puzzle game. This helps keep my brain working and the brain is a muscle of sorts. I also am an avid knitter. One of the things I did which helped the most with hot flashes was to give up all dairy. Dairy does have some estrogen in it but it is cow estrogen and dairy and its protein casein is a major suspect in breast cancer and prostate cancer. My husband had to have prostate cancer to listen to me. We are both vegan now and we are much more careful about what we eat. Some plants have estrogen-like substances but they do not act like an estrogen in the body -- broccoli is high in this as is soy, and it is the same photo-estrogen and broccoli is higher. Go figure. I do eat tofu about twice a week and eat a lot of leafy greens. We have out own vegetable garden. Giving up eating the foods I mentioned relieved 90% of the arthritis I had, and I do sleep better. It does take time to see some of the benefits. I did feel my mind had slipped a bit but then I have severe tinnitus and no the vegan diet did nothing to ease that. But I finally have found relief from my sleeplessness. Now that Spring is back, I'll get more sunshine. You have to take B-12 and Vitamin D to follow my diet. \n\nMy mother died with a hip fracture so she had osteoporosis, also diabetes type II and my sister and mother both had breast cancer, my dad died with high blood pressure, diabetes type II and Alzheimer's disease. So I have no cancer and my bloodwork shocked my doctor, he was flabbergasted, and told me my bloodwork looked like I was in my 20s. \n\nOur nutrition comes best from the plants we eat. I was constipated most of my life, no longer. Once that gets better, you start feeling better as if there are toxins you can't get rid of, you can't absorb what is good without him reabsorbing the toxins stuck in you if you are eating lots of meat.

But my menopause was pretty smooth sailing. Yes I had some hot flashes but it's not the end of the world. My thinking was foggy and I wondered how I would maintain my job, but a few years later now and my thinking is sharper than ever. It all comes back! It's only while your body is going through those changes. The same happened to my brain during pregnancy. The brain changes because when caring for children, one's brain has to juggle a lot of things simultaneously and on the spot. Men don't have to think like that, they have continuity. Women are more able to manage more than one thing at a time. I think the brains of women and men are very different. Not just due to the corpus collosum but because we wired differently, our sensitivity is towards happiness towards others more than men but this trait is not valued in our dog-eat-dog male-derived society.

Women multi task all the time, our brains can handle it. I notice in my life, men miss a good percentage of what is going on around them because they are \"focused\" and in our skewed society being focused is what everyone strives to be but it's not ideal to be focused all the time. It's like there is some kind of dishonor to be unfocused and able to swing from one thing to another and back again. Women do this all the time but men don't notice usually so it's never mentioned. A plethora of patterns exist that women don't mention because they don't want to offend men._ Hello.  I don't mean to break in here.  But, if you feel yourself slipping, find a doctor that supplements bioidentical estradiol and progesterone.  You may even need testosterone.  This is all available today and has been since the 1960's.  The old products were horrible, not bioidentical so they brought many problems.  You can get your levels tested and they will start you at a low dose and you move up until major symptoms are gone.  I have been doing this for 12 years now and I feel fabulous.  But, I also exercise daily, eat a paleo-like diet with lots of veggies.  I believe that my hormones are preventing brain damage.  I am taking college level courses in my 60's and sometimes get the highest scores in the class.  I take Divigel which is a transdermal.  Good research that transdermal is best.  I use an over the counter progesterone called Progest.  You could trial these things and see how you feel.  It's sad that we aren't designed to function that well past child-rearing.  Some people handle the change better.  I don't feel badly that I need help.  It helps that I had an aunt take hormones until she was 87.  She was incredibly sharp!  She led the way.  Hang in there.  Go get help when you need it.  This is one of those things where we may have to tell our doctor what we want.  They may not realize how well the best products work!_ @pshkdjdbd3950¬†  Hello dear!  Not to worry!  Solutions are out there.  Very safe because they are bioidentical.  Your body knows how to use and then break down estradiol.  It's not like a drug where it's kinda close to something your body makes.    You seem very bright and capable.  ;-)   It takes time to discover our greatness.  ;-)    Wishing you well._ @kathrynanderson2737¬† thank you,How long does menopause  last? I'm 56 yo and thought it was gone._ @justinamusyoka4986¬† Menopause symptoms can last an average of 11 years.  However, the lack of estrogen will change how the brain is supported once the ovaries are no longer working.  Estrogen is needed to keep the brain cells alive.  It's best to get hormones within 3 years of your last period/menses.  There is some research of adding high estradiol/estrogen supplement of 2 mg daily in late 50's to 80's.    Find a progressive obgyn doctor to work with you.  Start at a low transdermal dose and move up until the symptoms are gone.  You will see MANY improvements -- everything from sleep, mood, lose weight, vaginal dryness, etc.  It's a really long list of improvements._ @kandersonohio¬† thank you._ Kathryn Anderson  Another of the MANY improvements.

BUT there is a difference in the chemistry within the structures themselves._ Stephen Catton honestly no hate, but I‚Äôd encourage you to study biology around this subject a bit more. Certainly there are biological differences between sexes, especially when it comes to hormones, however it is quite an unscientific claim that hormones would affect women ‚Äúmore‚Äù. Women‚Äôs hormonal changes can be more predictable (at least from a medical expert‚Äôs perspective) due to the cycle, men‚Äôs tend to be more unpredictable since something like just seeing red can have a huge impact on men‚Äôs hormones at a given situation. However, hormones affect the wellbeing and behaviour of all of us.

But the menopause causes a big drop in oestrogen whereas men do not suffer a drop in testosterone to the same degree so again women's brains are affected more by their hormones.\n\n\nThere are lots of similarities between men and women but also many differences. We react differently to external stimuli, Women are more risk-averse for example.  We are generally interested in different things, women are normally more interested in people and men in things. Women keep telling me that they are better multitaskers. It is almost all men at the top and bottom of the IQ bell-curve. All these are a product of the brain. There are so many physical differences between men and women why would one not expect it to include the brain?\n\n\nAs she states, physically there are differences between male and female brains.

There are issues in the if data manipulation, but without going deeply into that, C02 comparatively to other gases has higher transmisabilty of heat, C02 heard up more quickly, but also cools down more quickly, so there's no warming effect from it on aggregate. Secondly warming causes C02, the oceans naturally release C02 into the atmosphere, warming causes this to occur, as they heat up they release more of it, like beer does as it heats up it releases it's C02, thirdly man made emmisions of C02 cause the oceans to release C02, when there is more C02 in the atmosphere already oceans release less than they otherwise would, keeping the amount in the atmosphere stable.\n\nSo if we're to find problems caused by human emissions of C02 we'll need to look at the effect of ocean C02 retention.\n\nNo warming of the atmosphere to be found as a result of man made emissions of C02, however there is evidence of higher atmospheric variability caused by man made, and ocean caused atmospheric C02, which is a different thing, the levels of C02 atmosphericall are still within normal bounds._ @_l735¬† The thing is, I'm not a scientist and don't fully understand exactly what happens (I understand the basics: fossil fuels release CO2 emissions, that alongside chopping forests also releases CO2, which in return acts like a blanket in our atmosphere and heats the earth... resulting in more arctic ice loss and higher sea levels, etc.) But the point is that the scientists (who like really know what they are talking about, way more than me)  believe that global warming is happening and it is man made- 97% of scientists to be exact. And it makes sense to have a few scientists who doubt it b/c the job of scientists is to question and doubt and dig for countering evidence- I mean even gravity is a theory... but even then 97% of scientists believe in it, and it's difficult for me to understand why people don't_ I really recommend you listen to people like Elon Musk talk about it, if you just search it up you'll be able to find him speaking about it.

I also believe their is warming, you should do more research, there is some man made warming, there's a heat effect produced by human activity which is strongest around cities, human bodies create warmth, but so does human made heating systems and such. Most of planetary warming appears to be driven by what are called Milankovitch Cycles though; see here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles\n\nThe IPCC (UN body on climate change) has a rich history of data manipulation, and deliberate limitating of what are know as \"the terms of reference\" (essentially the limit of data that is examined for reporting, or what factors they consider).\n\nYou should look to renown climatologists over rocket engineers or astrophysicists, they don't specialise in climatology._ @_l735¬† ngl i'm much more inclined to believe scientists that someone on the internet_ Ur acc tapped_ @zoeskinner2871¬† if you don't want to take my word for it, you might like to actually investigate scientists claims._ @emmagrimes6717¬†  Elon is a billionaire, not a scientist.

Oceans have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished and the sea level has risen. From 1901 to 2010, the global average sea level rose by 19 cm as oceans expanded due to warming and ice melted. \n\nThe sea ice extent in the Arctic has shrunk in every successive decade since 1979, with 1.07 √ó 106 km¬≤ of ice loss per decade. Given current concentrations and ongoing emissions of greenhouse gases, it is likely that by the end of this century global mean temperature will continue to rise above the pre-industrial level. The world‚Äôs oceans will warm and ice melt will continue. Average sea level rise is predicted to be 24‚Äì30 cm by 2065 and 40‚Äì63 cm by 2100 relative to the reference period of 1986‚Äì2005.

So yeah ... humans have been making a huge negative impact on the environment and this pandemic has really exposed this \" evil truth \" to millions of people. That being said, I also acknowledge and admire all of the positive efforts that humans have made and continue to make to ensure that areas of the environment are being protected and efforts are being made to reduce pollution. But as for now, humanity's appetite to consume and destroy is far stronger than our abilities to reduce consumption and to protect the planet.

And when the news of corona came in China, I knew there was a chance that this will turn into a pandemic and I knew somewhere in my heart that it is going to be messed up. And that's exactly what has happened. I had so many plans for the future and now most of it looks impossible. I'm glad I'm not married and don't have kids, because I can't even imagine how that would have panned out. I have donated what I could for this fight and I have promised myself that if I ever come out of this I will finance education for poor kids, I will not adopt because I don't want kids and I'm not very parental. And maybe alot of people will need to donate for a lot of causes. This will change a lot. People will stop spending on non-essentials and focus on what is important. Same goes for countries.

It doesn't matter how hard first-responders, nurses, parole officers,  foster care caseworkers,  law enforcement, military personnel, ministers,  teachers,  sanitation workers, farmers, and so on work ... they will not make more (or enough) money to meet much more than their family's basic needs.\n\nDavid Brooks wrote about the people who actually keep the country running in his last book \"The Second Mountain.\"   My hope is that in the economy that emerges after COVID-19, we will actually value work and contributions to the community._ South Korea never once had any type of lockdown in their country and managed to flatten the curve.

Moreover India is supplying much needed medicines to US and other countries._ USA works only for the rich and the greedy...now for the world to see.\nLost a lot of myrhos.\nLost a lot of respect .\nLost a lot of respect .\nNow we can all work towards reality and truth._ When everything come back to semblance of normalcy. The rich elite will be more predatory to prey on the poorest masses so as to squeeze them of every resources they‚Äôre getting now from their government.

If those numbers hold for the rest of the country, which I expect, that means there have been around 30 million cases so far. What does that do to the death rate? What will be different is that we will hopefully start being more critical of experts and what we read and see on social media.

So, the Chinese approach works. The Western countries are too slow to react. Didn't they see that China closed down the city? Keep waiting for China to tell you to do something?_ Universal use of masks also has been shown to   be very effective_ KR cases seem to have come back._ Robin Redbreast¬† Patriots don't quibble when a personal sacrifice is required to aid one's country.

Less than 400 cases (majority imported) and so far no lockdown. Surely the gold standard of responses so far, even better than the Koreans.

Lets come together against this sucker!_ Trump doesn't believe in experts because he isnt nor has he been an expert at anything he's done and doesn't believe in Science because he doesn't understand it.

This is not to say there isn‚Äôt excellent research and science, but not healthcare, particularly as it is linked to individual economic capacities. Priorities indeed!\n\nGreat interview. Thanks for sharing these talks, I‚Äôm truly enjoying this series!_ This interview is really interesting and the questions and answers are well thought out. But what really bothered me and stood with me is the fact that he takes the european union as an example to show how governments prefer helping themselves, it's not true that the countries within the eu denied help to italy. Borders were closed to slow down the spread of the virus, bc in the schengen area travelling is part of daily business. It's the same concept as shutting down restaurants. And Italy got financial help form EU funds to keep the economy from crashing the same way as Greece a few years ago, which frankly can probably not be avoided. They got medical equipment such as pumps and so on. Germany is taking over patients into their hospitals despite being overloaded already. I personally am really disappointed to hear a CNN Journalist making inacurate statements, especially from such an educated and well articulated person._ The world economy will not recover until all workers who commute or work in a crowded environment are issued quality respirators that filter exhausted breath in addition to air intake. I've modified an aftermarket filter element to attach a N95 HEPA filter to the exhaust valve guard on a Honeywell full face respirator but PPE manufacturers can produce an outflow filter cartridge to fit the exhaust valve seat too. A similar retrofit can be developed for the N95 fiber filter masks by adding an exhaust \"pillow\" made of N95 Pre-filter disks to the exhaust valve on these disposable masks. Please demand that all PPE factories operate 24/7 and expand to meet the demand or \"The center cannot hold\". Part #s are: Honeywell NS76008A or Chinese ST S100-3 Full Face Respirator; Weld On #3 acrylic solvent; NS80867 exhaust valve guard; NS750035 Piggyback Adapter; NS750015 Filter Holder; NS7506N95 HEPA N95 Pre-filter._ thankts to a pointless lockdown_ We are indeed all in this together! But we have political leaders in this country and around the world who have built their entire political strategy around separating and polarizing their people. Here in the US the time is long past for us to sit idly by while Trump and his gang tell lie after lie, spin distortion after distortion, dodge every responsibility and endlessly blame others for their mistakes. If we are to come together to defeat Covid 19 we will first have to silence the voices of those whose very survival literally depends upon keeping us polarized and apart. The 25th Amendment was created to remove a president from office when it became apparent that he was physically,  emotionally, or morally unable to carry out the duties of his office. How much more evidence is required to substantiate that Trump has failed, is failing, and will continue to fail all 3 of these tests? What good does it do for Dr. Faucci and other experts to recommend the use of face masks when just seconds later the President announces that \"I won't be wearing one.\" What good does it do to advocate caution and a phased reopening of society based upon real scientific data when you have a president who when asked what he is going to base his decisions on points to his own head? Folks the time to act is now...the life and lives you save may well be your own and that of your family and loved ones. Write your congressman and urge the removal of Trump from office. Now!_ WW3 - COVID 19\n\nWW4 - Climate Change_ Now we know that the opening applause in all TED videos  is  fake._ Excellent interview..

New businesses will start up to replace those that are left in debt.

It was some small fact that I notised, who was his view of things there I didn't agree, not so important....however... He's a journalist an CNN anchor, even if he's is on top on many things...he's not an expert in any of the areas he's talking about. He's opinion, who cares? And then I thought about swedish news ...they try their best not showing their opinion on TV about anything. I don't think I've seen someone making an interview with a journalist or news anchor ever, in Swedish television or here on Youtube. It's their job to do that. But I really like Fareeds news program though, I do._ It's gonna be different._ 3 things. Now 4._ A president takes accountability. üá∫üá∏.

Why we studying Coronavirus in bats anyways_ Good job Fareed Zakarya. I am 11 years old and I am very much concerned about a post covid-19 world. I think all countries must increase health spendings to save a future of my generation_ This guy is fake news and will always be fake news._ @1:52 - \"India's of the world\" - I respect Fareed's reporting but he should choose his words carefully. Being ex-Indian doesn't give him bash the country and use its name as synonym of poverty._ He doesn‚Äôt tell the audience was slow because China and who lied about the severity of the virus._ So after all America is not the greatest in the world._ I don‚Äôt have a job anymore. It‚Äôs only a matter of time till the money runs dry. At least the warm weather is coming for when I‚Äôm homeless._ Imagine if we spoent the same amount of money on defense budget and into healthcare for all, research in new medicines and vaccines that are affordable_ The second wave is coming people filing for bankruptcysies which will follow an epic housing market crush which will make 2008 housing crisis look like small cake. And then automobile crush as people are unable to pay for their car leases meaning auto industry the biggest job creator will start shading jobs and the spiral will continue to no end with the virus hovering over our heads. Small businesses unable to get credit since consumers have reduced spending thus more jobs lost. we aint seen nothing yet_ Thanks Fareed for sharing your views as brilliantly as usual!_ What's that for an expert saying stupidities on how European countries reacted towards Italy and how US government is so better reacting than the rest of the world?  TED talks I doubt I can trust you anymore!! What a shame_ Great analysis by Fareed. So we spend $700 billion on defense each year and we don't  have simple N95 face masks and other PPEs for our first responders and medical staff. Doctor and nurses are getting sick from reusing the disposable masks and other PPEs. We still do not have adequate testing available at the point of care. How can we control this virus quickly and effectively? SHAMEFUL._ Disagreed with China‚Äôs ‚Äòlying‚Äô, but more ‚Äòignored‚Äô to unknown virus, just like all the other countries behaved afterwards._ I think these two guys should be saying\nLET'S START WITHOUT BILIONERS AND OLIGARCHS.\n...........\nI AM becoming to have an impression that the virus is COMING FROM CHINA.\nB.

Analytic indeed!!_ Consider yourself grateful. You'll get to experience what millions of other American's have had to go through, throughout the years before the pandemic._ Well, you can also break your bloody back at the local Grocery Store ._ exactly,  instead of spending as much as the next 5 countries combined on defense,  we must back off and spend more on us, our healthcare,  present and future.   Within the past 5 years,  the DoD \"lost\" 1B dollars.

There's evidence that the darker your skin, the higher the likelyhood of serious infection, which is reflected in the numbers coming from NY especially. Not due to the common misconseption of socio-economic circumstance but it's the skins ability to make vitamin D from sunlight. Vit D boosts the immune sysytem - lots of evidence summed up in this video from an ex A+E doctor in the UK    https://youtu.be/GCSXNGc7pfs_ One of the biggest things I see people fail to consider, is who in their right mind is going to want to open a business in the future when the government can shut it all down in the snap of their fingers causing you to go bankrupt.   What happens when the next flu/illness comes around?  \"Everyone close your doors, sorry for your loss\".  You would be an idiot to invest serious money in starting a business.  I'd be surprised if restaurants ever come back to the same scale we had.

At the same time appeaser's who have been collaborating with these countries , paying out massive bribes to secure business ties with corrupt politicians need to be rounded up , arrested and prosecuted._ We still don't even know the truth if this is from the bats who brought us SARS-1 Ebola and MERS, or another bioweapon like many of these countries have uses in the wars?_ This is much worse than anything before, especially the Great Depression, because we cant step out to be with people anywhere, or to console each other and be consoled. We can't take any work at all in fear of dying.

Someone with sense in the media! A very rare occasion in the 21st century. Thank you for your service Fareed. We need more people like you in this nonsense social media age.

They never talked about how it affected their respective families, neither did my grandparents who were adults during the time period. I only learned about it through reading or seeing documentaries. Unfortunately,  they are all long gone, so I can't ask them what it was like for them and their relatives or in their communities. But it doesn't seem to have changed their lives in the long term._ I have always enjoyed Him however this video is mistitled it‚Äôs more like a Q&A I was expecting more about how the world will change which it is light on the details_ They have.   Eisenhower had a nationwide effort to rid the country of polio.   Nixon signed the law creating the EPA.   Obama left a pandemic playbook._ How did you get that impression.

It's an outdated system which, over the last decades, only been glue patched together to carry on. but the technology changed the way we think, work, communicate and produce stuff dramatically. what we call 'economy' should support our further evolution not hold it back.... so many technologies and projects never came to life simply because 'they weren't profitable'. we should be mining asteroids and harnessing solar energy now, instead we produce useless stuff and fight to death over liquid coal we burn... we have XXI century technology but XIX century mindset..._ TED news._ So crazy to me that we WORSHIP capitalism in our culture to the degree that we‚Äôre letting it destroy society. Take Amazon for example: Jeff Bezos making $9 million/hour while denying his employees basic health care, PPE and paid sick leave. The sociopathy of capitalism is clear: we value money more than life itself. This needs to be a topic of intense discussion: how can we create a new kind of capitalism‚Äîor a NEW kind of socialism modeled after countries like Denmark, Finland, etc (not Venezuela, like our leaders like to scare us about, in their false premise that all socialism = fascism. That is a LIE.) We need a Bernie Sanders type of ethic, driven by humanism, justice and compassion, Not megalomania! Trump style capitalism will lead to global genocide, as laborers and other ‚Äúpeasants‚Äù will die en masse, for lack of access to viral resources, while the fat cats buy private jets and multiple mega mansions.

Augmented hologram reality type business meetings to interact without actually being there in person. or Tesla's self driven cars to use as an alternate uber driver_ When I saw CNN, I stopped watching.

China saved lives, and that what matters._ The old guard will dig in and fight tooth and nail to return the world to what they had before_ lots of interresting perspectives habe been shared. and I agree some things like meetings could be done more adequately and less traffic would cause improvement for nature. But I don't agree on the idea that it would be better, or even  well to realise that everyone should just step over to more knowledge and digital bussiness. I think this crisis should show us how us investing more in digital realms is not much to our benefits now. because digital bussinessed in some way do get more oppertunities now that we live in social distancing. but we miss the capacities to feed the poor have proper amount of supplies that need to be produced by non digital supliers and well trained healthcare workers. It shows how reliant we are (and fragile) on basic needs for human survival. enough food, health supporting proper space and ability for living in hygiene.. I don't think we can have a better world after this if we invest in more dygital ways to work. I think if we invest in that and undermine the importance of those imposed inferior jobs like cassiers, suppliers, factoryworkers, trashman. well put ourselves in even a more difficult possition for future crisis'. I think if hadnt been undermining the importance of those type of jobs we would have been able to much better manage this whole thing in general. if we weren't so reliable of external suppliers etc. I hope I made my point. wondering what others think of this_ This interview was well below my expectations. I watched most of it and he didn't even talk about universal basic income. Aside from the fact that he was complacent about one of the villains of the moment, Donald Trump._ Witch one is ted?_ \"No one is objective, but I'm trying to be analytic\" - I think that is the most honest, real comment anyone can ever make._ be ready to lose A.I. jobs when A.I. does not need you anymore._ yup ,you might have learned something_ sorry for the many typo's, I just wanted to write it out as I was thinking it. And on my phone I find it a bit harder to recognize grammar mistakes. And it's not my main language._ It doesn't mean that he has the ability to be analytical. Thinking about it Zakaria's sentence makes no sense whatsoever. I can see that he wasn't good at math and would never be able to resolve Bertrand Russell's problems. This great mathematician gave 10 questions where logics is the only path to find the solutions of the problems, like a detective. Thumb down for Zakaria with a logic that is absolutely illogical and his audience who doesn't know how to think and is bogged down by catchy words with no meaning. I call Zakaria's verbiage \"Verbal Flatulence.\"_ So true._ You might have books\n... But Fareed has a library_ Like could minimum wage could pay rent in states like california._ I think the vital point in this whole discussion is it to realize that in a liberal and democratic state, to implement a phase of lockdown and acting quickly, takes time and sacrifice of resources especially when a country is doing well economically. We tend to see the approach used by the Chinese government as effective because of how the political infrustructure is setup. We can not keep going back to the fact that we have to act quickly especially when you do not have sufficient intel on how the virus looks like. Perhaps in future it might help in planning.

OVID\n\nI won't say neither Hi nor Hello mr Ovid.\nWe are enemies, to death, not competitors.\nHow can I possibly talk to someone or something or somewhatsorver that has taken 126,681 lives so far. People who pass away, many of them alone, without anyone to hold their hand, while you steal them their last breath.\n\nWho are you?\nTo begin with I'm not impressed by your Latinate surname. - Gutta cavat lapidem - or a droplet will break through the bottom of  your lungs.\nI'll hold my breath and, while keeping you at bay, I‚Äôll spit out on  you the turmoil seething in my head in these curfew days.\n\nWhere do you come from?\nI‚Äôm not interested in knowing where you  came from. Someone has called you ‚Äúthe Chinese virus‚Äù. The one who said in a speech: give us some global warming it's freezing in here. A trustworthy guy! Unlucky American friends you are all endowed with the unalienable Right of the pursuit of Happiness but not Health, unless you have an insurance.\nOthers claim it was Batman, on a secret mission who  delivered you as  a present for the Chinese. Or. You could also be a kind of creature fled from Victor Frankenstein's lab and seeking revenge against its creator.\n\nIt is self evident that your birthplace was simply Earth as you can speak all the languages of the world, you travel both in business class as well as on low  cost flights, without a passport.\n\nWhy now? \nPerhaps you‚Äôve read the real Ovid's Metamophoses - all life undergoes continuos changes and everything is in a constant flow.\nMaybe you thought the spreading of the human species is close to its peak - we look like lemmings running in their frantic suicidal migration and we‚Äôre close to the edge. This was  the time to give us a decisive blow to claim back the Earth that  belonged to your kind long before we appeared.\n\nHow am I responding?\nThese days I‚Äôm not sending to  know for whom the bell  tolls. I know it might toll  for  everyone of us. \nNevertheless.\nThis will be the saddest period of my life. This will be the happiest period of my life.\n\nYou think you‚Äôll be the one and only king of this world. You‚Äôve quarantined presidents and princes. Jailed the globalised  economy in an intensive care room; Lehman Brothers style. You have confined us in our houses. - Divide et impera. - You‚Äôre sure that you‚Äôve made us suspicious of one another. Compelled us to wear another mask on our masks.\n\nNo!\nI just pulled over - most  of the world has - turned off the engine and started breathing and smelling the air, the scent of sea breeze and orange blossom. Then I heard neighbours speaking in a low voice and a child playing with himself and laughing, joyful as ever. Never listened to the silence like now. \nEnd of the noisy fossil fuel, carbon dioxide, private automotive civilisation.\nAnd then people started singing and musicians playing from balconies: all the world is literally a stage. No cruise ships In Venice, fish have come to visit that jewel, never before so magic.\n\nReligions, no religion: no pilgrimages to Rome or Mecca, we have to speak face to face with our Gods or with ourselves. \n\nBoredom? Nothing of this kind. A lot to see, to listen, to read, to make sense of, to decipher while scribbling what‚Äôs on my mind. As I watch the traditional and new media I see the the worst and the best humans can do: corpses in the street in a poor country; valiant doctors and nurses on the frontline; black market of masks; herd immunity and lockdown or food and some money for those who can‚Äôt earn a living. ‚ö†Ô∏è All the power to a single person ‚ö†Ô∏è.

And if that vaccine will be available for everyone in the world at no cost - without anybody becoming rich for having produced it, \n                                           WE will ANCHOR you DOWN.\n\n\nOPEN LETTER TO YOU \n\nHello, hi!

I'm embarrassed for our president arguing partisan politics with reporters and throwing tantrums in the midst of national crisis. Does he care about the dignity of the office? Do we still have aspirations left as a society?_ Is this guy gay! Yep_ I guess it is extremely hard and painful to say China did a good job on handling this crisis. If he willing to see the fact and be objective, he would see China actually did the best job on handling the outbreak. Also, the democracy and dictatorship does make a big difference and impact on events like this.They both have their strength and weakness, although I assume it is very hard for a western people(especially low educated or brainwashed) to admit. Btw, Hong Kong is not a country, not like I am saying it, it's on the book._ South Korea is a very small country and no larger than many U.S. states, although they‚Äôve done a great job, China has done nothing right and are still messing things up._ The virus should shock Americans into reassessing the world and globalism. \n\n\nWe Americans need to take a hard look at China:\n\n\nThe problem with totalitarian governments like China is there is no feedback to the government....because there is no democracy and free speech. As a Trump supporter, I'm glad we have an open system, where critics can take fire at President Trump. I think that's a strength of our system, not a weakness. China has several weaknesses plus some strengths to worry about. \n\n\nIn China, totalitarian government combines with no feedback loop, combines with modern technological control of the population with computers, combines with an ancient culture that seeks to avoid looking bad...ie saving face, combines with The Art of War. Then China interacts with America, where we Americans are open and naive, where we have had decades of progressive left wing indoctrination that says we Americans are bad and other cultures like China are good, where our universities teach such nonsense and much of our population believes it.\r\n\n\nFareed is a typical anti-American academic.\n\n\nWhat can the virus teach us about China and communism?\n\n\r\n\nThe CCP made the virus. Why did they do that? They had a plan. That plan was to take us out. They got careless. I don't think the virus was deliberately let loose, because it hasn't crippled us. It was something they were working on. So, they moved too early by being careless, revealed their hand, revealed their intention: they want to take us out as a civilization. That's my guess.\r\n\r\n\nThe Chinese people are fine, but communism is the virus and the CCP must be taken out. We cannot allow them to exist on this earth, because China has 5X our population and they have proved themselves to be technologically clever. As they will increase in power, if present trends continue, they will be much much stronger than we are. They will kill us once they are strong enough.\r\n\n\nWe need a new strategy to take out the communists, out of China. We have historical precedent for this: By the time World War II ended, most American officials agreed that the best defense against the Soviet threat was a strategy called ‚Äúcontainment.‚Äù In his famous ‚ÄúLong Telegram,‚Äù the diplomat George Kennan laid out the strategy that successive Democrat and Republican Presidents used, to destroy the U.S.S.R.\n\r\n\nWe'll never survive long term if we don't remove the communists from China. If China is in the future, a free and open democracy like us, like the people of Hong Kong want, we can get along fine and the rise of China will be good for the world. If the communists  can do this virus to us, with no real consequences, then as they get stronger and stronger, they will eventually take us out. \r\n\r\n\nWe made a long range plan to take out the Soviet Union. It took us 50 years to defeat them and remove the communists from there. Next we need a plan to remove the communists from both America and China. This is not just a problem in China. The virus is in the United States. \n\n\nOne uncomfortable fact that isn't much talked about is how China perceives itself. Because of our history of slavery, many Americans don't like to think of the world in racial terms. We find it repugnant. This is especially true of Jewish Americans whose families suffered, from the race based German ideology in the 1940s. \r\n\r\n\nMost Americans are happy with races mixing and mingling. That leaves Americans with a pretty big blind spot when it comes to China. I think many Americans don't see the world as a racial contest, but this blinds them to the reality that, even though that's not how many of us divide up the world, we assume other races feel the same. Guess what? That's wrong. \r\n\r\n\nChina is both a country and a race. The government of China perceives the world through a racial lens. We in America are an open multi-racial society. They are not and don't intend to be. They want the Chinese race to dominate the planet. We Americans have failed to understand that point of view, because of what happened in our American past, with slavery, plus the Holocaust. Also America was on top for so long we got arrogant, we assume everyone wants to be like us, we assume everyone in the world wants a multi-cultural society, we assume we'll win, we'll always be on top, we assume the world must belong to societies that are open, as opposed to societies organized around racial lines. \r\n\r\n\nGuess what? That's all wrong. Those are bad assumptions. The future belongs to post-racial societies only if they win the contest for the future. If China wins, this will usher in a future era of nothing but blatant racial competition. \r\n\r\n\nReality just sent us a warning shot. Will we listen?\r\n\r\n\nWhen we assumed that race based competition for geo-political dominance ended when we defeated the Nazis, we were wrong. It hasn't ended. It just took a pause. \r\n\r\n\nThe reason most people fail to see this is that the way we perceive the world and the way we perceive race is not how the government of China perceives it.

Earth is one system and we should be managed it and handle this crisis like that, globally._ If economic depends on the continue selling of product without been needed, is not economics.\nEconomy is a balanced system based of continue update inventories._ Corona numbers:\n\n22 March, Italy:\n70% of hospitalized people were male, 30% were female.\nThe average age of hospitalized people was 65.\nThe average age of people who passed away was 81, 99% with underlying conditions.\n\n13 April, Netherlands:\r\n88% of hospitalized people are over 50 years old.\r\n50% of hospitalized people are over 69 years old.\r\n80% of hospitalized people are overweight.\r\nThe average age of people who pass away is 81, most with underlying conditions (assuming 99% as they did not bother to give a number).\r\n95% will not get hospitalized (this number is likely higher as not everyone has been tested)\n\n\nLet's do some math:\nMale, under 50, not overweight, no underlying conditions --> chance of hospitalization if you get diagnosed: 5%*70%*12%*20% = 0.084% (a chance of 8.4 in 10,000). \n(formula: the chance of hospitalization*gender*age under 50*not overweight).\n\nFor females of this group, it would be lower (0.036%), for overweight people somewhat higher. But if you're not in a sensitive group (i.e., someone above 65 and/or with underlying conditions), it does not sound too scary. It is safe to say that if you have no underlying conditions your chance of surviving will be quite high, considering less than 1% of deaths are of people without underlying conditions.\n\n\nNext formula:\nMale, over 69, overweight --> chance of hospitalization: 5%*70%*88%*80%= 2.46% (a chance of 2.5 in 100; or 250 in 10,000\nThis is clearly a much larger chance - however, still, 97.5% would not get hospitalized considering these numbers.\n\n\nThen, if such a person would have no underlying conditions the chance of survival would still be relatively high. Someone with underlying conditions in this group would have the largest chance of passing away; as it is the most vulnerable group.\n\n\nLowest risk group (female, under 50, not overweight), chance of hospitalization:   \n3.6 in 10,000 (or 0.036 in 100)\n\nHighest risk group (male, over 69, overweight) chance of hospitalization:             250.0 in 10,000 (or 2.5 in 100)\n\nNote that the actual chance may be lower, considering not everyone has been tested.\n\n\nSo, why so scared? Only 1 sidenote, if you would get hospitalized and you would need a breathing machine it's important that hospitals have enough of them. That seems like the main challenge, but for how long can we lock down everything considering these odds? Of course, I think it's honorable we are trying to protect the older and more vulnerable in society - but some people are talking about a lockdown for months or years to come. How is this justified considering the numbers? Can't we try to protect the vulnerable people while not totally staying locked down? Just something to think about._ First who cares what this idiot think , he is bias lefty . \nSecond what we should do is to close our borders send the illegals back home and start relying only on our own county, period !_ Butt ugly_ Fareed is a cnn news anchor not a medical or sociology expert.

This is unsustainable and this mild pandemic ( remember that the Spanish flu killed 1/4 of the world population in almost a year till 1919) is the first sign of our future failure.

The Chinese Communist Party owns all of the business enterprises in Mainland China. Western countries manufacturing repositioned manufacturing into China for a bigger cut of making product profits. In turn, the Chinese weaponized ownership of these Companies. Case¬†in point, Pharma manufacturing. The Chi Coms have said, they will refrain shipments of pharma products to countries who cause irritation with the Chi Com leadership. Chi Com leaders have also said they would sell Face Masks to countries but now with HUGE cost increases. So, what should be done after this pandemic has been abated? Well, as a global participant, China is not a hospitable participant. It's leadership being a One Party Control Country clearly has shown an unwillingness to openly communicate with the globe. This Chi Com Government is not answerable to anyone or anything. Chi Com leadership exerted unusual power onto the United Nations, World Health Organization to deflect culpability into the Wuhan Virus. So, I say with the total ridiculousness of the United Nations, maybe we should evaluate the need to retain membership into this useless Organization. Especially after a massive Pandemic was spread globally but the UN protected China instead of the global citizens. As for China, maybe its better to remove strategic manufacturing from China. The Rest Of The World doesn't need a playground bully denying health & welfare products to the rest of us, when the Chi Coms egos aren't being stroked._ No. It is changing.....all the time...

Today it takes hours. Travel was rare and very expensive. Today many can afford to travel. The news travelled slowly in 1918. Now it spreads around the planet in seconds. These dynamics will ultimately make Covid19 very different to Spanish flu. For things to return to a semblance of normal the virus has to be allowed to sweep through like a wildfire and the survivors pick up the pieces and create whatever world they can out of what is left._ How about:   NOT AT ALL.  #NormalPlease_ A CNN AGENT?????

So when CNN presents facts based on physical evidence, you disagree?_ @lynnekaluzniak1894¬† In this cased Fareed being a CNN is a fact, the guy works there, he has a show.

You say he is a journalist. Laughable, don't be so ignorant, he is a misinformation agent giving us cr*p. Like the rest of that news  network. Finally, if there is a CNN show about physical evidence, like I don't know the speed of light, I wouldn't be challenging that.

All information starts with identification not a pass ports and other prefound reaches at the population of the world._ You three are complete AH's.

This explained most Americans are Trump incarnate. They willingly sink with Trump...too delusional to see otherwise._ That can cbe changed to the \"american liberal\" now though. Think about how dumb they are when you realize they think men can have periods_ @abdullakutty8153¬† this is a good question, and the predominant ethos of CNN and other legacy media has been to avoid answering this actual question, as a person who campaigned for Bernie and voted for Jill Stein, I would encourage you to look at other media sources and read books, CNN definitely wanted Hillary to win and thought they had sabotage the election for her when they handed her the questions, The DNC sabotaged Bernie More importantly most people have lost faith in the era of experts and for good reason, It doesn't mean we don't need credible sources, just that we don't have them at the moment, The New York times and Washington Post have always reported in favor of power and people on the left and right have been suspicious of them for this reason, But as neoliberalism has taken over genuine liberalism and neoconservativism over genuine conservativism, there is a new alliance around nationalism which bonds people on both sides of the political spectrum, for example I as a person on the left was in Seattle in 1999 to oppose the WTO, The Democratic party of 2020 would call this racist because they have fully embraced the corporate PR of work identity politics which has destroyed any semblance of class-based identity politics that used to bond the left, that is to say the corporations have made everyone so afraid of being called racist that they have embraced corporations as a good thing as long as they put gay flags on their coffee mugs and make feminist razor commercials, and effect the neoliberals have brought a puritanism to the democratic party, Trump is a narcissist in my opinion but he is not a part of the system that people want to see fall, this is why he won in 2016 and the reason I would bet my entire fortune that he will win again in 2020_ Don't say it so loudly_ That‚Äôs a shameful and pathetic way to describe everyday common people who have been destroyed by the elites, corporatists and  bureaucrats over decades. Have some class and humility._ I can bet you that this calendar year we have much less deaths than last. ‚Ä¶.

The problem with medical supplies (like PPE) is: You can only send it if you have it. The shortage does apply to all countries.

That will be a long ways off. Plays, concerts, festivals, museums, family get togethers, travel... just not the same on line._ CNN makes the news worse than it relly is._ I think the best way to determine the long term effects of this global downturn is to simply study the effects of the Great Depression of 1929.  If you talked to the people who lived through it, their lives were permanently changed.  For instance, many people distrusted banks so much that they saved all of their money under the mattress, never in a bank.

The people who are ‚Äúdisgusted‚Äù by Trump were mostly like that from before Election Day, the US media have exacerbated this and have been trying to control the narrative a lot like The Chinese Communist Party does.

SARS-COV-2 just entered India and sub-Saharan Africa;  the virus now has a target of close to three billion humans - while it is mutating.  It just amazes me that some of the smarter people in the media are still willing to say foolish things along the lines of, ‚Äúthis will likely kill nowhere near as many as 1918.‚Äù  How could we ever know when China has incinerated so much evidence and continues to flagrantly lie about it?  How many have died from COVID-19 and been misreported? Will the flesh eating turtles in The Ganges submit their body counts and test results in a timely manner?  Globally, 100 million may be a conservative estimate, let‚Äôs hope not, but God seems to be doing some spring cleaning at the minimum.  How do you propose we vaccinate everyone in the Favelas of Brazil while their president still has not accepted it as anything but a little flu?  That‚Äôs a virus reservoir that will keep giving like Santa Claus with Herpes._ The world is still working albeit with fewer workers.  Those who can work from home.

Maybe people won't be so willing to blindly follow capitalist agendas after this._ @frostedsilver¬† I agree! while i'm not necessarily anti capitalist, I do recognize that maybe its time to restructure or adopt some aspects into our government, that help bridge the increasing wealth gap between the immensely rich, the overly burdened middle class and the ones that struggle at the bottom. I feel as if that could only really help create an environment that encourages prosperity in all dimensions for the people.

Some of it just isn't adding up and my gut is telling me that I smell a rat. May countries  have surplus ventilators and hospital beds. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated the ANNUAL mortality burden of influenza to be 250‚Äâ000 to 500‚Äâ000 all-cause deaths globally; however, a 2017 study indicated a substantially higher mortality burden, at 290‚Äâ000-650‚Äâ000 influenza-associated deaths from respiratory causes alone, and a 2019 study estimated 99‚Äâ000-200‚Äâ000 deaths from lower respiratory tract infections directly caused by influenza. \nCOVID-19 has so far caused around 137,000 deaths but the entire World has been just down and we're just about under house arrest.

Given Gates' record of poisoning and sterilizing people with his vaccines I wouldn't have his junk anywhere near me._ @aussiesam01¬† Its older people who are dying. That's called viral Pneumonia and it's been the leading cause of death in elderly for thousands of years.

He was referring to \"expert\" economists from organisations with acronyms who, in the run-up to the Brexit vote, were making ever more extreme predictions of what would happen to the economy if the UK left the EU, without laying out their assumptions or how they reached their conclusions. They have a poor track record of getting it right and people were being asked to believe them just because of their job title, without examining their case, which is not how democracies work. Michael Gove was correct to call them out for it. Fareed Zakaria either didn't bother to watch the interview or understand the point being made (in which case he's not an analytical journalist) or he knew that and is deliberately misleading people.

I guess the narrative is that China is being subversive and devious with all the help that they are providing other countries with.  I guess that makes it on par with the U.S. right?  China helps most countries in the world for its own self-interest, and the U.S. steals medical supplies from overseas for its own self-interest.  Must be on par I suppose.

I would agree that Fareed should have point his point across a lot better but it wasn't a disingenuous comment_ @geoffcrossley8344¬† If you're relating your narrative according to newspapers and tvshows or videos, you might do it well.\nBut you want to describe proven facts, then you must write another thing.\nThe European Commission has approved the Italian aid scheme 48hours after it was requested, in mid March. The scheme was approved under the State aid Temporary Framework to support the economy in the contexto of the Covid-19 outbreak,¬†adopted by the EU Commission on 19 March 2020, by the Executive Vice President Margrethe Vestager, you may read it in full on the EU website or ask to receive it on your mail by just following the request procedures.

The people ARENT ready, nor will they seemingly ever be en masse due to poor understanding and fear_ Chela McGuire even though we have before or are you saying it will take a long time ?_ History shows that humans are able to forget over time. Future  generations will be oblivious. We so need to change our past habits and re invent our life of the future._ Yes, that's this nations greatest ability. Let's hope it is a kinder America_ V G this is becoming bigger than past events. I like your optimism, though. We need more of that but I have been tracking this since late January... haven‚Äôt seen anything positive yet, and once you get it, you get reinfected because the virus goes dormant to learn and evolve within your body to get you sick again (roughly 3 weeks). This reinfection can be more deadly because the virus has already taken a huge toll on the human body. \n\nBest way to prevent it or to not die from it is to not get it in the first place. Take care of your body. Eat healthy. Take extra precautions and be safe._ We already have the tools nothing is lost but history keeps us from moving forward because of Dept we are in big Dept it creates a block_ Voxel Verse Excellent comment._ it is suddenly possible to see lots of individual awareness  about what is your priorities. buying less has proven valuable, for instance_ Robin Redbreast¬† fear of non complacency.

By the time the federal stimulus hits, if ever, I will be homeless._ Mr. Zakaria, with respect, I think you have too many fundamental observations from ‚Äòwithin the bubble‚Äô. The world is - in effect - a Corporate Oligarchy. Yes, there are regional variances, but in the overwhelming majority of countries, there has been a focus on supporting big business first, then citizens, then small business as an almost an after thought. Follow the money. Where are the subsidies and stimulus packages going? \n\nA realistic expectation is that the soonest we could expect the global day to day life returning to normal would be ten months or so. It‚Äôs much more likely to be two years. While lockdowns might be wound down in 4 to 8 weeks for the most part, social distancing and the effects of massive labour disruption will fundamentally alter everything for many, many months.\n\nWhat businesses always fail to point out is that no matter the environment, no matter the barriers, businesses find ways to deliver products and services. Businesses rarely - if ever - need to be protected. If a business isn‚Äôt viable, it will be replaced by one that is. Where there is demand, there are those who provide supply. \n\nA large percentage of the jobs that are vanishing will never, ever come back. The fourth industrial revolution is occurring right now. We‚Äôre too close to see it, now, but in 20 years it will be obvious. A dozen years ago, Video stores like blockbuster employed as many as half a million people around the world. DVD manufacture, sales, and hire were a big thing. Netflix and Hulu and similar streaming services employ a few thousand people globally. For the most part, none of us noticed when we stopped hiring DVDs. \n\nWe need to transition to a new global economy. One that recognises that human value is not measured in currency. Corporate boards and the financial sector as a whole needs to be returned to their rightful place - nothing more than mid level book keepers. They don‚Äôt create things. They don‚Äôt provide essential services. You won‚Äôt find them listed on Maslow‚Äôs hierarchy of needs. \n\nBroaden your thinking beyond the interests of Wall Street and the neo-liberal and neo conservative fantasy lands. The majority of the world are just ordinary mums and dads, brothers and sisters, sons and daughters who are going about their days. Squabbling with family and neighbours, catching up with friends when they can. Doing the day to day things they need to do to keep their life on track.\n\nThe Corporate economy, and the moral vacuum of the neo-liberal and neo-conservative ideologues have led us to this point in this condition. The fourth industrial revolution and the pandemic now require that we transform. The question is, will we transform for the benefit of the corporations or for the human populace._ Most of the so called experts are biased in one way or another_ i'm no one but... isnt it too early to talk about an after-something ?_ I'm predicting extreme economic segregation. Got a taste in \"08\"._ Iodine was the only thing proven to have cured and prevented in a 2 million dollar study after the 1918 flu pandemic. They recommended that aerosol iodine be used in all hospitals and  public places and deduced that that would have completely stopped the epidemic. It is Lugols iodine I am talking about. Very easy to make with only one ingredient. Potassium Iodide. You break down the ki salt to pure iodine and combine it with more ki to make the iodine water soluble. It's simple but I won't go into the whole formula here. I'm no chemist and I make it myself. It works! Every time I start to get sick I take a bottle of water with 10 drops and I'm better by the morning usually. If not one or two more doses always does. God bless you all. Stop complying!_ The future is probably not war but overabundance. We try to push for longer lives, have more comfortable lives, keep those who are growing old to live longer. We want to travel, we want to have our cars, our computers, our big houses. The population just keeps growing and growing. The young don't have to worry about being sent off to die in war anymore. They have to worry about pandemics, environmental catastrophes. Corporate conglomerates, fake media, the loss of meaning in life. Life will certainly be different after this. But maybe it's for the better because the path we were on was heading straight down._ Globalist regime coming out of the woodwork - a great economic paralysis by design jacka**! Wait 'till God Almighty takes you guys in for questioning, you'll be singing a new tune and facing a radically new normal for eternity._ Fareed wants us to be communist Chinese_ I'll tell you who's doing good right now.

The lockdowns achieve almost nothing other than to slow it and gives you a bit of time. Tracing and testing is a dream especially in somewhere like India we need to stay lockdown for over a year it's not going to happen._ I thought everyone in New York was dead?!? Bunch of CNN liars... wake up people. This is it!!! Its almost too late._ Fareed and his ilk just don‚Äôt get it. They are so out of touch with regular folks. Before you say Fareed isn‚Äôt elite, maybe you don‚Äôt know who his parents are or his salary at CNN._ I could puke hearing complaints about the inequality created by the epidemic from the media who created the panic._ The interviewer has got to stop doing propaganda for him and his friends against Trump and just act as a serious reporter. Stop bitching about Orange Man Bad!! At least for now._ Well, the Ruling Class, 1%, were badly damaged by the corona virus.  The Ruling Class is aware they will be replaced by the working class if nothing is done to improve economic and social stability.\nExpect a rewind to the pre 1990 world, before the Berlin wall fell.  Nationalism is a result of the Ruling Class trying to save themselves because Globalism is a massive failure for the working class.  Or expect Civil War._ Excenlente, gracias_ Hey anti-Indian. Are you saying Modi should have given 4-5 days to prepare for lockdown so that people could move in mass numbers to their native places? Seriously man?

The Coronavirus draws out the sharp divides between the nation's HAVES, and HAVE-NOTS, as who you are, who you know and where you live can make the difference in everything, including life and death._ I got my direct deposit today._ I stopped this video at minute 3:12 after I heard such lies!_ your president is out of touch not Fareed_ It‚Äôs the stimulus that‚Äôs going to make more people go bankrupt than the virus_ Landlords can not evict anyone through the courts and Banks are not foreclosing - as of now in NY and Jersey, possibly your state..._ Sadly, I expect a BLADE RUNNER future._ J W... if it‚Äôs any consolation, our version of Soylent Green will be flavourless protein flour made out of... well... air. Not dead people. European company is scaling up to start large scale manufacture next year. Google Solein. \n\nThe one possible silver lining is that Corporation don‚Äôt make economic sense. Because they don‚Äôt deal with externalities (such as social or environmental costs), they are an inherently unsustainable modality. So even if they do get the upper hand, it won‚Äôt be for long. \n\nA good illustration of what mean. Here in Australia, I have to pay about $5,000 (US) for electricity per year. I spend about $2,000 (US) on petrol (gasoline) for my car per year. For about $70,000 (US) I could get an electric vehicle and solar panels for my roof and in less than ten years, I will have fully amortised my situation while cutting dependency on both big oil and the local power company.\n\nEmergent technologies like EVs and 3D printing, etc, make things very difficult for corporations. \n\nThat said, you may be right. Dystopia May await us. :/_ @tasmanianbadger¬† You thinking a bout being a self sustaining self efficient individual I like that mentality \n\nBut sometimes I feel it is a bit too late because at hand there is no work, no commerce no economy running to even think about starting your own self sustaining model_ Omar El Cheikh. If I may presume to give unasked for advice: begin very, very small and use incrementalism to drift towards sustainability.  For example, there are many perpetual vegetables (carrots, potatoes, etc) that you can buy once, then plant and replant over and over endlessly. For example, carrots. Leave the green on the top of a carrot and don‚Äôt use the last two inches of the carrot and you can replant it.\n\nI‚Äôm doing the whole sustainability thing for a lot of reasons, mainly because of cost. With growing most of my vegetables, self generating electricity, having rainwater tanks. I‚Äôve got my cost of living down to about $100 a week. That said, I own my 20 acre bit of rural hillside and have no debt. Those last two are the absolute key.\n\nI think we‚Äôll all have to hunker down and adapt. With three variants of the virus already, it means that the virus is highly morphic. So we can expect to be hit two or three times a year. Combine this with the fourth industrial revolution, and things get a bit chaotic.\n\nI‚Äôm just a bit disappointed that I wasn‚Äôt able to build my castle, first. I have a cunning plan for building a castle very, very cheaply. Oh well.\n\nBe well._ Well done Adam. I read your comments over and over._ What happens to the military industrial complex at this point?  Best and worse case, if you have time.  üòâ_ Hi Adam, interesting view. Could you please reach out to me on Instagram or Twitter? The handle is @carolshadowfax I am a journalist._ Cara starbuck. I‚Äôm afraid I have neither Instagram or Twitter. You see, I‚Äôm terribly, terribly old. :).  If you wish, I can be reached at tasmanianbadger@gmail_ Lisa Bevans... ah. Now that is an extremely good question. My guess is that it will evolve - somewhat - but slowly. Transitions are chaotic times. Anything could happen. General Colin Powell was once asked by a congressional appropriations committee why equipment for the army was so insanely expensive. His reply was along the lines of: ‚ÄòIf you leave an anvil with a squad of soldiers in a barren desert for a couple of hours, when you get back, you will find the anvil broken...‚Äô. The military Industrial Complex is about money and reputation. It is not about security, honour, loyalty, etc. \n\nFlesh and blood soldiers will be increasingly replaced with robots and drones. Imagine a five ton bomb being dropped by a bomber. Now imagine that one mile before it strikes, it splits open and several thousand 3 or 4 pound drones fall out, start up and start flying. Now imagine each of these drones using its inbuilt HD cameras to look for something that it recognises as a human. Each drones yells ‚Äòdibs‚Äô (or the cybernetic equivalent) and flies to their person. Then they explode. Such drones will have a flight time of about 20 minutes. They be able to fly at about 15 miles per hour. Such a munition as this 5 ton bomb would be able to depopulate an entire city with relatively little damage to infrastructure. I guarantee that the military industrial complex is working on weapons like this. They may already have them.\n\nThe Corporations make their money by providing weapon systems. The F35 stealth fighter is something like $115,000,000. Each. Perfectly serviceable F16s and A10s are a fraction of that cost. The problem is, if you pit eight F16s and eight A10s against just one F35, you‚Äôll probably lose all of your F16s and all of your A10s. \n\nSoldiers are expensive to train. Very expensive to patch up when they get blown up, and a public embarrassment to the Government when they die in large numbers. Neither the Government nor the military industrial complex wants lots of human soldiers. \n\nSo our weapons are going to increasingly be impersonal, devastating, and expensive. The size of the military, however, will shrink (ie. fewer jobs). It would be great to just not have such an outrageous military, but people like Putin exist. Without the existence of the US military, China WOULD annex Taiwan and probably other Asian countries as well. Putin WOULD use salami tactics throughout Eastern Europe. Some Middle Eastern coalition would erase Israel. Think of a play ground with pubescent boys feeling all testosteroney. It‚Äôs only the bored teacher glaring at everyone who keep some of the boys from creating their own novel recreation of Lord of the Flies.\n\nThe US needs to stop the forever wars. They need to stop going to war for political or corporate reasons. The USA needs to use its military for humanitarian reasons only. Further, the UN has got to stop tolerating the failure of the member states to pay their bills. The lack of payment and participation by a large percentage of the member countries which gives the USA both the imperative and excuse to play glaring teacher. \n\nIf we are very, very lucky, we will - globally - redefine Corporate Governance and Responsibility. At the moment, Corporations have one purpose; to make a profit. There is no obligation to consider the environment, there is no obligation to consider the social impact. In fact, if a Corporation DOES try to be environmentally and socially responsive at the cost of profits, the board of directors can be sued by shareholders.\n\nIf we redefine Corporations, we can morph the Military Industrial Complex into something that does more emergency response work. With Climate change coming, disaster relief will be an increasingly urgent facility. \n\nWhat‚Äôs likely to happen? Well... Trump is surrounded by awful people. People who hide behind ‚Äòrespectability‚Äô. It is alleged, for example, that Mnuchin headed a bank that knowingly and intentionally stole millions of dollars from their customers. It is also alleged that Kamala Harris chose not to prosecute him... and received considerable assistance in her political career shortly thereafter. I haven‚Äôt the foggiest idea whether these allegations have any truth behind them, but that‚Äôs not the point, the point is that there are very few politicians in the federal government who don‚Äôt have worrisome allegations attached to them. \n\nI think that Corporations have done a splendid job at getting populations to be highly fragmented and polarised. I think political parties have very ably rigged numerous primaries and elections to ensure that as few unifying, visionary leaders as possible make it to the top. \n\nWhat I think will happen is not particularly rosy. I think the world will become increasingly small and mean. I think our leaders will be increasingly craven. I think it is for the Millenial generation to clean up the wretched mess left by the boomers. I‚Äôm from generation X. Really, the only thing we‚Äôve managed to offer is Elon Musk... oh... and Dungeons and Dragons. Okay... maybe some good music and great writers Neil Gaiman... but that‚Äôs it.\n\nWell, Miss Bevans. I hope I‚Äôve sort of answered your question.\n\nWe live in great and terrible times. \n\nBe well, be safe._ Good question_ Joakim von Anka¬† the kind you want is not what youre gonna get_ @sintohsono8832¬† well if you have that attitude about it, it won't.

Officially, Americans are dying at 4 times the rate that Canadians when sick with covid19.  The multiple may even be greater as it appears that so many people have not yet been counted, moreso in the States than in Canada.  Our cities are similarly densely populated.  The only real difference between the populations is Canada's universal health coverage.  Canadians may be healthier as a result.  We definitely don't fear bankruptcy when we go to the hospital.  If herd immunity works for Sweden, it may also because most of their population is healthier for similar reasons to Canadians.

YouTube has sold its advertising soul to Satan._ I'm Canadian, and I wouldn't get smug about our fatality rate. You're missing some salient points in your comparison. The US has larger and more numerous concentrations of urban poor people than does Canada, and a larger population of elderly in long term care. However, we do have several hundred thousand indigenous people, many of whom live in poverty in remote locations, but who have fairly frequent contact with people from urban areas (government workers, police, returning family members). Usually when indigenous people living in these areas are seriously ill they are flown south for treatment, but that obviously can't happen in a pandemic. What will become of them? Both the federal government and the provinces say infections and deaths have not peaked and will not do so until next month AT THE EARLIEST. And we have the same problematic testing approach as the US- we only test people who present symptoms, when we know it is spread by the non-symptomatic. And even symptomatic people directed to testing centres by their GPs are being turned away, at least in Ontario, which has the largest population, because there simply isn't the capacity to test them, never mind do mass testing. If our federal government, which was warned by military intelligence in early January of the gravity of the Wuhan outbreak, had not sat on their hands until the middle of March to actually do something, many more lives could have been spared. Right now isn't the time, but Mr. Trudeau, his ministers and advisors will have much to answer for._ @Grimenoughtomaketherobotcry¬† I agree, Canada is far from being free from problems.  I'm not being smug, I didn't want to write an essay.  But to the extent that the numbers apply, we are dying at a lower rate.  Limited though it is I think our health care system has something to do with this.  Especially since we don't fear going to the hospital to get help.  This is the most salient point.   A larger city does not equate to a higher population density.  I think Canada and the States offers a pretty apples-to-apples comparison._ @dawnandy7777¬†  Actually, pandemic or not, you have EVERY reason to fear going to a hospital for help in Canada, if not from financial cost, and even that's assuming you're not paying for parking. I'm guessing you've never had the joy of visiting the emergency room of Credit Valley Hospital, or better yet, Brampton Civic. These were nightmares of over-crowding and \"hallway medicine\" BEFORE the pandemic. They are \"dealing\" with that now by simply sending \"non-life threatening\" ill or injured, non-Covid19 patients home, at best with a prescription for pain-killers, which, if you are not under 25, over 65, on social assistance or a refugee claimant, or have no-copayment prescription coverage from your employer, you get to pay for, twice, as your taxes pay for all those people the government fully covers. Understand that I am not opposed to genuine, fully-funded single-payer healthcare, but what we have has been dying the death of a thousand cuts ever since the Liberal PM's Chretien and Martin began to underfund it over 25 years ago, and it has continually been manipulated by whichever party holds power to buy the votes of various interest groups. This pandemic will very likely tear the mask hiding the glaring inadequacies right off, and what's more, when it's over there will be even deeper cuts to cover the current massive spending of both the federal and provincial governments. Our taxes will also be  going up, I'm guessing a lot faster than the time it takes to be seen in an emergency room in the Region of Peel. As for our fatality rates being \"better\" than those of the US, you chose to ignore every point I made, the salient point being not that we have a public system and theirs is private (theirs, like ours, is in fact mixed; the proportions are different), but that ours may prove to be just as inadequate, and quite possibly more so, when the final death toll is known._ Good for you and American have Trump for another 4 years._ Salient points and good interview!

And the borders haven't been closed out of distrust or old resentments, but due to different stages of progression of the virus in the different countries and therefore diverging containment measures.

However, the governments are diving deeper into spreading awareness and educate the citizens so we could understand of what really is happening in the current situation, moreover tax and debt payments are not mandatory in order to ease the citizen's needs.

And not to forget, there is our dear neighbouring country, who tries to alienate a whole religious community from the first day of its independence._ @YakuzaSRC¬† dear as i told you before you should read and gather some knowledge so that you follow a golden rule of thinking before speaking. Speaking about kashmiri pandits kashmiri Muslims to this day miss them and we will definitely wil get them back here and for your kind information 217 kashmiri pandits were killed at the beggining of armed rebellion in 1990 by who ? you say Kashmiris but which kashmiri they were killed by raw agents under the so called governer of rss jagmohan so that after that they label kashmiri rebels as terrorists and get a free hand to do genocide under AFSPA if Kashmiri Muslims had problem with pandits it would have reflected in 1947 at the time of partition only not 50 years after partition till then we were living in communal harmony and the question is in first place why the armed rebellion broke out  it was because in 1987 elections were rigged by india which was won actually by MUF this MUF became hurriyat later on , Kashmir was betrayed time and time by india first giving autonomy, when india only had a role in currency , communication and security then reducing the autonomy jailing an elected prime minister for  years all these things led to the rebellion, now you will say pakistan well pakistan definitely has a role in Kashmir because you have to ask the question pakistan was formed because of partition on the basis of religion only so it is not that simple to understand kashnir has a Muslim population of 90%  but we kashmiris still do maintain it is a issue of land not religion religion has been mixed by both India and Pakistan for their own goals .when partition happened our ruler was a hindu maharaja Hari Singh his pruposal was also that we neither want to stay with india not pakistan but when india betrayed the Mountbatten  deal in junagarh which was opposite of kashhnir, muslim ruler and hindu majority that led to the first war in kashnir, now india wil satisfy its tongue and ego by saying Kashmir is an internal issue that way india has to first explain what is internal and what is external, a peaceful plebiscite of kahmir is the solution which should be done as early as possible because we have suffered to the level of infinity now it is time that this issue be resolved.._ @M C haha go and check news properly they are regularly have closed door meetings on Kashmir and ignorant people like you text without using their brain.._ Sir please do mention about kashmiri pandits_ @tarunsinghnegi3559¬† Be it Kashmiri Muslim or Kashmiri pandit, everyone suffered. Those who left from Kashmir might even be able to live their normal lives although they would still miss their original homeland, but those that are still living in Kashmir are nothing more than unfortunate.._ If indian govt removed the lockdown, then, there  will be blood shed of largest level.

Began in 1945, the new world order,\n1.4.  Politics: 6:19.  Internal and external politics.  Internal: how do we deal with wealth gap, how do we allocate resources.  External: between countries, and rising powers dealing with existing powers.\n2. Q about Global Depression: 8:47.

Dalio's answer goes back to his fundamentals (money, credit, fundamentals).  Computers have more CAPACITY advantage over humans.\n6.  24:43 Follow-up question about passive investing and 401K advice.  Dalio's advice NOT to market time, and diversified own's assets.

World is so fragmented that it is almost dangerous to say thank you to those who are helping.\n9.  34:10 Q about capitalism, and how it needs to be reformed.  Dalio's answer is to go back to basics, and re-examine what we mean by the American Dream.  Criticism about where we stand with respect to that.  Importance of education as an equalizer,  and a driver of productivity.  But society thinks of education as a cost item.\n10. 40:11 Q about rebuilding and low pay / low skill workers.\n11.  46:30 Dalio talking about the importance of seeing the argument of the other side.

However  we must be mindful of regional culture and I am not sure of the solution. My father was a teacher in NYC In the 60‚Äôs through 80‚Äôs. He witnessed even then the difference between districts even then where some areas embraced education and others took the attitude of how to do what is needed to just pass.  He did reach some. Even into his 90‚Äôs past student still call. But the point being you can do all that is needed to enable people to excel but you cannot make them excel. With that said you cannot through the baby out with the bath water. We do need to build the best future possible. \n\nAs for China and other areas of the planet I may have missed this, but I see the difference of working with individuals who for the most part will act as a good business partner and governments that take a stance that is more us vs them.  I am not a globalist in thought pertaining to creating a homogenous world, but I do feel the world can strive to work together as individuals without threatening governments.¬†\n\nWonderful and informative interview._ Good old Ray.

It is absolutely complicated and time-consuming since fundamentally people, in general, are very dynamic in their way of thinking. This leads us to live in the fragmented societies that he talks about. Even saying thank you to someone who helped us could lead to people labeling us since it is shifted their perspective. Now imagine this on a political level? What will happen if Trump saying thank you to China? There will be undoubtedly causing a shift in the American Politics atmosphere... We do tend to agree to a side which we can benefit from but we all must realize when we got the benefit, that there are always sides that are not benefited from. In the end, instead of widening the gap of arguments, the solution is to be productive which can lead to economic growth even if it's slow. How to boost productivity? Is basically with the help of education, the more smart people in a country, the more likely they will have inventions and innovations. It is already proven by China. Thank You, Ray, for enlightening me more about the importance of thinking first from both sides' perspective before taking sides blindly because of false information (hoax) or misleading media which often sides to the one that gives them benefit. It's like playing a Chess \"INSTEAD OF CRITICIZING THE MOVEMENT OF YOUR OPPONENTS, WE SHOULD MAKE MOVES THAT MAKES THEM CIRITIZE THEIR OWN MOVEMENT\"_ Excellent Excellent Excellent_ Computers are so cheap. They are not an insurmountable barrier to education. Manfred Spitzer, a renowned neuroscientist, speaks in detail about the dangers of electronic devices in the development of children's brains. Education is of unquestionable importance but the key is WHAT is being taught: Character and wisdom versus culturally marxist ideology, including feminism and so-called \"systemic racism\"? While I truly admire Ray Dalio's expertise in the economic realm, I doubt his judgement in the social/political world. He thinks of Angela Merkel as a great leader, e.g., even though she, in cahoots with other globalist decision makers, is responsible for grave very long-term damage to the social cohesion, cultural strength, and demographic composition of Germany and indirectly of other European countries._ I forgot to add below:‚Äù Comunismo and Socialism are the quintessential , most typical example of MONOPOLIZE-ACTION! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è_ China forced(unintentionally) many young people to become waters.. by removing American company from the scene.. remember ‚ÄúFord‚Äù factories, (?)\n\nthose families could send their children to school, some went to trade school at night after paying their basic bill..

I need help, to make my (DNA) family money: The Imperial! Thank you!\n In Russia, where I'm now, I cant get any consultation about making of my family money._ I learn as much reading the comments as I did with Ray's interview!_ My Crown of the IV kuril islands in economics means: 1. Every one will find out that WEF was estublished in my (DNA) honor! I can visit WEF and I can ask questions, about how I can conect (how to get in touch) with many corporations, that  have something about me on their logo's, working in many countries all over the world, and that means, they are with my Crown of the IV kuril islands KHIS. I'm saying \"Hello\" to all of them and thanks, from me and from my parents also, because for us it's  big honor, that we are on so many logos! We love that! Together, we can make plans about what kind of relationship we going to have with the corporations.  Then, I found also, a lots of national flags of many countries, that are saluting me with something about me (DNA) on the flags and I'm saying\"Hello!\" and many thanks, to the  leaders of that countries and to all people from that countries! I want to ask the leaders: what is our relationship was planed to be? What do we want it to be? Now I dont know anything about the life on my IV independent kuril islands KHIS, because due to political repretions in RUSSIA, I havent even been visiting my IV kuril islands KHIS yet, and I havent started to live there yet.  Means the world is behind the plan, because Russia didnt work in that direction. USA failed to pay me salary 1999 from Apple corporation, as it was planed since 1976! Apple corporation wanted to be the First corporation in the world, to pay me my salary and they wanted to set a great example of how fun it's to pay me my salary: I'm the Apple logo, (The Empress) and AAPL - are my fathers Peter's name, my father inspired the name for the Tyatya Vulcano in Kunashir island, and the names of his siblings and each of them have very interesting destiny also: Anna, my aunt: the soviet literature and the russian language teacher: Inspired the Tsar Pavel I to create The Order of Saint Anna (1797) and The Order of Saint Anna, has the first winner (The winner is I'm) in literature and cinema, for the film and book \"Last train from Roppongi\". If Apple, Facebook and Yotube, would paid me on time, as they inspired by my film and book \"Last train from Roppongi\", they would also receive the Order of Saint Anna (1797), from my family (DNA).  The Order of Saint Anna has plans to have more nominants each year, that are creating something very interesting in Literature, Cinema, Arhitecture, Technology, Fashion and Science. Agnessa, my aunt: the soviet midwife:  With salary from Apple corporation my children's birth would be safe, and my family could invest in making the birth of Children safe, all over the world! Petr, my father, soviet electrician, engeneer, economist = With our salary from Apple, my family CAN MAKE great SKI and hot springs TRIPS TO THE TYATYA VULCANO posible! Leonid, my uncle, the soviet train operator: I'm with film makers from Japan, plan to make the train from Hokaido, Japan to Kunashir, The Land of a thousand candles! (–ß–∞—Å—Ç–Ω–∞—è –ñ–µ–ª–µ–∑–Ω–∞—è –î–æ—Ä–æ–≥–∞). WE HAVE MANY other PROJECTS WITH MY MOTHER'S NINA'S SIDE OF MY FAMILY as well: Educational projects, flights to Space, French and other world culinary, and much more! That is why, we must ask Russia to start moving forward with relocating me with my family, to my IV kuril islands KHIS, to officially close the dispute, started after the WWII: who owns the IV kuril islands KHIS?  The answer is: I'm (DNA), my children, grandchildren, grand grand children... And that is gonna go forever...  It was a secret for 75 years after the WWII. It is very long time...I want to ask all countries, that salute me on their flags, that I also love very much, and I want to ask all corporations. that have me on their ligo's,  the questions about \"How We want to keep our relations to help each other grow in many ditections?\"  Now, I know only that I must collect the salaries from more then 300 best and biggest corporations from all over the world, because having something about me on their logos, help's them to sale what they produce and they feel secure, Because the for very long time, they belong to the same crown and that isnt planing to change, exept now my Empire is officialy has the place on the world map, the IV Kuril islands KHIS, north to Japan. For Hundrets or thousands of years my Imperial crown stayed with me, even I wasnt born yet. I would love to find out, what was working for governments and corporations about belonging to my crown? And what wasnt? How we can make things better for all of us. What new law need to be made? For example, I'm with my passport of my islands  KHIS, should be able to work in all countries in the same time!  Because any country must have oportunity to have corporation with me on their logo. How I pay tax's in so many countries or I dont pay taxes? I also own the right to have my own DNA  family House of a thousand candles (33) money. The imperial. The curency of the IV kuril islands. All countries and corporations, that are legaly involved with me and with my Imperial crown of the IV kuril islands KHIS, are brilliant and I'm sure brilliant people work there! I want them to be heard.  It is very interesting for me to find out what they will propose. And I belive, it will be very interesting to expirience more of the real history of our world, with my family story from the USSR, opened for us, for the family members and for the people all over the world! We all will get richer from learning my family story!_ \"Open, thoughtful disagreement\" as stated by Ray is exactly what is missing broadly. Platforms like this need to stop assuming they know the answer and that the \"other side\" is inherently wrong and irrational. I get that it might alienate some of their audience, but surely that's a fundamental cause of the polarisation we're seeing in public dialogue? It's telling that Chris won't even approach the idea._ You cannot trust people who eat dogs._ 32:54 - 34:19_ I don't understand why people worship every word that comes out of this guys mouth. Half of it is generalised to the point of being impossible to prove wrong. He clearly loves the sound of his own voice but never really says anything.  \nSince serendipity was shown as the single most significant determinant of 'success', his 'knowledge' is most likely BS supported by overconfidence brought on by survivor bias. THINK FOR YOURSELF!_ CNBC clowns should learn from this_ Ray, more than a million people live in concentration camps in China. The practice forced organ harvesting. See what they're doing to HK! You ask why we can't thank them? Idiot!!_ You don't get his point_ Ray lives in his own little bubble. He's got a very limited understanding of the average man or the automation happening across sectors. I'm supprised how much bs he talks and how disconnected he appears to be. Most people don't make their money from high speed trading you idiot! Most people don't have a \"good balance sheet\" and most entrepreneurs can't easily access money during startup the phase.  You can't easily redistribute wealth when the wealthy hides their money in offshore tax havens._ Dalio kind of pushed the 'China is Our Savior' rhetoric a little too hard. It's probably understandable because his fund probably consists of substantial sums of Chinese money. But then if that is true, he sold out and proved it right here on a TED talk. Appearing to be apolitical even if you have endorsed a certain side would have been the better choice. \r\nHe's is quite an inspiration, however after hearing him push the CCP narrative to the western audience on a prominent platform has me in deep conflict._ fair and intelligent guy hard to find nowadays_ The dangers of cash..._ ‚ÄûMay I take a moment to do that?‚Äù\nI can learn as much kindness as economy from Mr. Ray._ 5:00 minutes of the video:  Funny, Ray Dalio is a billionaire and puts number one of his list of the four things as the most important: Productivity.  Inventing, building and making things yet Ray hasn't done any of this.  He's a \"hedge fund\" manager and when asked \"What's a hedge fund?\" he will never answer the question.  The same can be said about Buffet and the rest of them.  Even though everything Elon Musk has done hasn't made a profit at least he's making products and serves.  I can respect that._ 45:00 globalist / collectivist on over drive with thanks to Chyna. Why not thank USA for NOT making supplies that Dalio thanks Chyna for?????????? insane._ Ray has summarized this in an amazing video titled \"how economy works\".  In my opinion it is by far the best resource to understand economy and everything that has occurred in this world in past 100 years.

At the time the S&P 500 was at 2,789.. that means Dalio sees the S&P 500 falling to 2,092 or worse.._ An interview where the expert, Ray Dalio is able to SPEAK üîä\n\nThank you.üôèüî•_ Well, he does fund adds value for his investors. It's not like he doesn't contribute to society_ So are u saying Ray is a Fraud_ That's because you're not watching him on CNN or MSNBC.  The corporate media is horrible._ Just brilliant information_ Ray Dalio is obviously an animal of his time. He should retire. Supposedly once you are past your 60s intellectual ability diminishes rapidly while your confidence stays the same. Hence the underperformance of Bridgewater. His view of the financial markets is outdated. \n\n1) The debt cycle is much shorter than he believes. This period is more similar to the late 60s debt collapse through the decoupling from gold than the 1930s. The 1930s was a similar period bu we dealt with it through monetary contraction rather than inflation. The same event repeated again in the late 60s and we dealt with it by decoupling from Gold and creating high inflation. We're not going to deal with this through monetary contraction but rather another high inflationary period that will deleverage the economy again and everything will be back to normal. We've done this twice before in 200 years.\n\n2) China is ticking debt time bomb. The less exposed the world is to it the better the world is lest they'll crash everyone's economy. They've expanded their monetary base through debt creation to the levels of a developed country while only being halfway to developed status. When you take into account the capital controls they use to prop up the renminbi, China's real GDP is only half of what they claim it is. That just shows how inefficient the Chinese government has been in managing China's economy. Doubtful they'll survive the decade. The CCP knows the end is near hence they're going the North Korea route politically. How can one be friendly with a regime that acts like North Korea?\n\n3) Whatever programs the government should implement must take into account a cost function. Capitalism is very efficient because of its cost function. Artificial Intelligence is very accurate also because of its cost function. Applying these cost functions to government policy may create results not liked by progressives, although it would certainly improve the quality of life of many people. Just as usual not in the demographics progressives prefer. For example can't just give a certain type of education to people who are not capable of learning that education. We already tried that with college for everyone and all it created was college scams and lots of young people in debt._ ‚úã my≈õlisz nad tym jak sprzedawaƒá na LinkedIn?

It‚Äôs good to hear his thoughts on the corona virus as well._ Pandemics, market crashes, etc show us just how stupid capitalism (with all of the inequalities it empowers) really is. This crisis would be much, much easier if we all had universal healthcare, tuition free education, internet for all and a UBI.\nIt would be easier still if we all had home, business and covered parking rooftop solar arrays, electric vehicles, indoor, outdoor and vertical food gardens in every home, business, school, grocery store, restaurant, public park and land, etc and if more of us studied and worked remotely from home.\nLet‚Äôs STOP TRYING TO SAVE CORPORATIONS AND SMALL BUSINESSES with selective bailouts and instead simply put capitalism on hold (mortgages and loans, rent, interest, dividends, late fees, utilities, etc), launch universal healthcare, a UBI, universal education and internet for all! #NoCorporateBailoutsRequired\n#TooFarLeft\nEducation is a good investment from an individual, family, community or national perspective and tuition free education will reduce the burden from the root on our medical expenses too for example.  \nHealthcare for all is actually CHEAPER with the insurance industry off of the table along with most of the time lost due to billing among many other reasons.  \nA universal basic income (UBI) is CHEAPER than all of the thousands of individual federal, state and local social safety net programs including things like Social Security and unemployment insurance, etc with all of their budgets, overhead expenses and inefficiencies eliminating the humiliating need for people to lose time to prove their poverty to qualify for aid.  \nInternet for all is a great and necessary investment to give everyone the opportunity to study, search for work, work remotely, etc online.\nSolar power is CHEAPER and electric vehicles are soon to be CHEAPER to make and already are considerably CHEAPER to maintain and operate, especially if charged from your own solar power.\nWhat do you think will happen to crime rates, peace and equality in general after we launch universal healthcare, a universal basic income, universal education and internet for all, raising the starting point of capitalism from zero, we'll let you die with no money, to a level of life with dignity, reducing societal daily fears on a massive scale and freeing us to welcome the automation revolution with open arms rather than with fear and great harm? üòÉ  #EqualityMovement \nCall me overly positive, but I think we‚Äôre leaving the era of ‚Äògreed is good‚Äô and celebrating wealth and entering an #EraOfAltruism and equality.

I want to know this much about the economy and history. #YOUAREMYGOAL_ Wow!! this interview truly blows my mind. There is so much to discover beyond good or bad/ right or wrong~_ Example of countries helping other countries. When the crisis first broke and suddenly hospitals were running out of masks Germany and France who produce them stopped lorries with already paid masks at the border to Austria and would not let them reach the Austrian hospitals. It took forever to resolve this. Later after both Germany and France were still holding elections when Austria already went into lockdown - the hospitals in France were overwhelmed with patients because of course the virus spread in these countries. Austria took French patients to take care of them. The Austrian government under Chancellor Kurz was amazing and extremely organised but again now - Germany and France are pushing decisions that are bad for the EU because they again want to line their own pockets ... It will be very difficult to get through this together because not everybody is a team player._ So much wisdom packed in this conversation ü§ì_ As Ray said \"A Revolution is coming\"---EAT the RICH graffitied everywhere. \"All animals are equal, except some more than others\"---George Orwell, Animal Farm_ Ray Dalio needs to ask himself: how can the US government borrow a unit of currency that it issues?_ Global Macro Investors clearly don‚Äôt understand the difference between ‚Äúmoney‚Äù and ‚Äúcurrency‚Äù.

But it's funny how China was so little explored, since they will be the leaders of the said New World Order! Don't believe it?

What Ray is tip toeing around is that we are on the verge of fascist politics in the US and another world war unless \"we can all just get along\" (or in is his odd phrasing \"be good with each other\"). Why he doesnt just say it instead of being so vague and wishy washy is because he is afraid of being called out as a commie  socialist  (which he has been by some of his more rabid colleagues) and China sympathizer._ Just invest in Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft and you'll be fine._ When did Ricky Gervais start wearing glasses? And hosting Ted talks? Why am I always left outta da loop?_ Dear Mr. Veruna \nI was greatly saddened on Saturday by your response... I was able to keep both Haylat and poor Fran. On the phone for more than an hour at length each on the topic of my ‚Äúdiscovery‚Äù both of whom were not able to disprove nor confirm it. So I went after A higher body than you! And they too were unable to prove me wrong or right as I break no rules of matrix multiplication! Dimensions, functions, variables. And In ENGLISH. WHAT I AM TRYING TO SAY IS I ‚ÄúTHINK‚Äù. \n\nIF bodies in space are able to interact with each other relative to time and space in the same infinite space domain that also has time....... and we are able to measure and ‚Äúinfer‚Äù those movements on their own. It is not very big! But in relation to another object say a planet in another solar system.  My understanding is that. \n\n‚ÄúWhen the body being measured IE the star. We look at LIGHT as the independent variable! And we co ‚ÄúOBSERVE‚Äù a transient event being the crossing of those two bodies.... which should ultimately result in less light being received by earth/satellite during that event..... YES! \n\nSo We can model the above with two systems in the same space and time.... so this mathematically would look like this. \n\nSun: \nF(sun): size, mass, light. To keep it simple.... \n\nPlanet: \nF(planet): size, mass, ‚Äúlight loss due to transition from mean‚Äù\n\nAnd we look at the correlation between light emitted and light loss. Yes To determine the transient ‚ÄúRESPONSE‚Äù. Yes! This would be done using a 2x2 matrix. Okay\n\nThis is still in space and time domain so no need for transformations! YES? \nThis information can be two 1xn arrays. Which we can measure and inform the entire above sequence from and build back up to more details as you agree that in this ‚ÄúSUB-SYSTEM‚Äù there are two elements our 1xn matrices. Yes and we can view correlation using data visualisation techniques yes...\n\nThis is an example of where I can introduce ML to optimize the features selected but really it doesnt matter because we only care about light and loss of light. Relative to both space and time... yes\n\nIF MY OBSERVATION OF THE ABOVE IS CORRECT. AND WHERE EINSTEINS THEORY OF RELATIVITIES ALLOWS US TO MAKE SOME OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS YES. \n\nIn the next E-mail if the above is true here. i will show you how I can adopt a new data storage method and reverse the process to end up with light vs light loss. But not as features but entire domains. Where they can be assumed to be made up of more stuff yes? \n\n this is why Quantum mechanics which is now being tested let alone discovered yes. Is a very new field. Relative to Einstein yes? (20 years compared to 100) 20% 80% between them) [let us also remember that these are fields of ACTIVE study, Both yes? \n\nBecause for a long time the atom was the smallest known and measurable particle.... yes! Until we decided to test it and we later found out there may be something smaller than neutron, electron, proton. \n\n\n\nIm going to stop.... \n\n\nWhat I am trying to say is when we believed the world was flat it allowed us to plow the field. When we believed that the world is round we were able to change the world. All I did was use extra dimensions to make space to see more data before putting said data into the Machine learning model using Einsteins theory of relativity to keep my data together with time.... !!!!! I can barely explain it any better! But 2d data was the biggest bias ever!!!!! \n\nPlease. \nGet Outlook for iOS_ Marco Russiver in Estonia is the Marco Ray refers to.  Here is the Ted interview about it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBSkV8sgUQ0\nThey are doing a global hackathon to solve problems created by the lockdown, business shutdowns, etc.  It's fascinating because they are using technology to solve common problems like employee deployment for underutilized industries like hotels and they inviting governments to be part of the solution._ Great interview.

Everything is corrupted_ If someone pay this lady a dollar a nod we could save the economy._ He has given us something more valuable than a date. He gave us the tools to critically think about what is unfolding around us and make our own estimations._ It's to dumb down society_ mmmm... so Chinese leaders initially denied the corona virus.... but how may things has the USA and its European and British allies covered up or denied in the last two centuries?? \n\nOr how many propaganda distortions have those countries sold and made believe the citizens of their countries??  \n\nI am NOT pro china being the world leader, but it is a good thing also that there is an alternative  to the complete control the USA and its dollar has over the financial system worldwide.\n\n \"Let me control the production and flow of money and I care not who makes the laws\"¬†\n\nThat creator of money is only one country for now, the USA, as the main currency of the world. That is why they sell the idea that if we got options it will \"destabilise\" the world economy, but of course that leaves them as sole decider and holder of all that power and control, and we are hoping the they have the moral compass to make the right decisions>  So for now we need to decide if Trump is that moral compass for the world, beaches he insists he is ONLY concerned for the USA, but the monetary system is GLOBAL; and we have sen with the Iran blockage, they do have control of the ebb and flow of the system... backed up OF COURSE by their enormous [not incredible] military might. Of course they got nothing good to say about the Chinese and ANY other country with some capacity to live without the \"american help.‚Äù\nWhatever ills the chinese ARE DOING now pales in comparison with the many GREATER ills the USA and their allies in Europe and Britain have done over the past few centuries. Does anyone now remember HOW \"america\" was \"colonised\" or \"christianised\", how they took by force all they got, half of the mexican territories??  Then they took Hawaii, just read the OTHER credible histories of those events, it makes whatever the chinese are dong seem like child's play!!\n\nIt is a good thing to have alternative monetary systems and let the countries of the world decide, but the elites of those allied countries will not let that happen, the system is supposed to be neutral and yet, the USA can blockade Iran access to punish them... imagine what they would do to the chinese if they didn't have that alternative to keep its economy going.\n\nI mean it is incredible that the USA is talking about TRANSPARENCY!!!    With its may many clandestine operations with their secret services agencies.\n\nIf the SWIFT system stays neutral for the world, \"America\" can not long survive as the world \"leader\". That SWIFT system transacts over 80% of the flow in dollars BY FORCE, the USA does NOT let other currencies be used as main method of exchange --- the USA is kept as leader mainly through propaganda and force, mainly because THEY SAY they are \"number one\" at all THEIR sporting and political events; and because THEY say they are the light of the world and freedom and such things they know little about, because most have never left their country. Go there if you can, and see what you will immediately see and notice as soon as you land at the airport, and once you go to public places like bars or sporting events, then ask those who were screaming that America is the best country in the world, about ANYTHING and see how much they know, or care. \nAnd that's why the SWIFT system cannot be neutral, it would show the USA for what it really is, a world wide bully. The only difference NOW is that Trump and his own deep state people who are loyal to the end, are just more open about it._ I think the real economics field is MACRO economics, the rest is analysing and using the effects of that, which can be guessed well by extrapolating the macro into the micro.¬†\nIt is so rare to see the micro affect the macro!! .... the best laid plans.... The sad thing is that no one can predict these Black Swan events at all, mainly because they are too awful and scary to contemplate, and if you speak up about it before they happens, you are called all sorts of bad names, and a conspiracy theorist, etc etc.  And the measuring issue about all these past events  is an issue because it has and cannot be as accurate as it is today with the world's connectivity in place as it is. By necessity in the past centuries a lot of things were left out of its calculations, right??_ Really interesting and enlightening! https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=QRvWdyuc2MQ&t=29s_ I'm a globalist!_ Ray Dalio, Jim Rogers, Gundlach, Schiff, Jim Grant have all been warning about this depression at least since 2018.

Morgenhthau specifically told Socialist FDR that the print and spend policies did not work. Going to war and putting the factories into high production producing for the war effort got us out of the Depression. The post WWII \"American Dream\" that drove consumer demand is what allowed for an increase in tax revenue in order to pay the debts racked up by FDR.\n\nYou need to search for Yuri Bezmenov on You Tube. He said that the U.S. was indoctrinated in Marxism in a full two cycles by the earliest years of the 1980s. He said it takes a full 20-35 years to bring a generation \"online\" to live the Marxist formation and make it incarnate in society. And that is a Marxism that goes unchallenged by the truth. (In other words, its a brain-washing). The formation in Marxism started with the policies of the Fed and the New Deal.\nWhat is wrong with these policies is their activist interventionism and how this disrupts incentive-driven behavior. Prior recessions without activist interventionism were corrected earlier and more quickly that those with activist interventionism because they allowed for people to make natural corrections, not those with engineered coercions.\n\nWe are going to end up going to war with China. There are too many reasons to do it. If China calls us to pay up on our debt, we won't have the money and we'll have to sell asssetts. That would probably ential surrender of our sovereign territory, even if only a leasing of it, allowing the Chinese to use it economically. And this is the savage CCP we are talking about. Possession is 9/10s of the law. Once they get our land, it will be a fight to get it back._ Great talk. Ray is one of the genuinly goog person. I believe he is a warior. We need more like him.

You put garbage in you get out, but since the feedback is positive, the students only get worse. This is solved by increasing funding in education and by holding parents liable for their children, not the other way around._ MrBodha I see your point - but can we?

I have been needing more information and wisdom  about our world because of corona virus.  I understand the restructuring. I know the world always will change. Ray Dialo just helped me to know where to put my attention and work harder at doing to promote the right education and growth. He helped me to know why it is so important to use our power to create a better world. Thank you, Sir, now I will make sure my grandchildren read the right books and utilize computers to be apart of the New Technology world._ Enjoyed the talk. BTW, what meeting app they are using, looks nice?_ i wish i was smart enough to know what he was talking about._ who is that Marko he talks about?_ Could be a gift for the world_ He is too diplomatic and wouldnt want to get caught up in cutthroat politics._ Study it_ He speaks in generalities and makes massive leaps without defining words.  In reality what is he saying: you can't time the market, don't day trade, have a balanced stock portfolio, and buy a little bit of gold. IMO, there is very little practical advice for the average man._ U don‚Äôt have to wish, YouTube his episode on How Capitalism Works, simplifies all he just said.  Learning is fun.

And the elephant in the room -is Trump...we couldn't have chosen a worse time to have him in  power!

But what this guy didn‚Äôt notice is that the US didn‚Äôt have a global completion back then. Now we not only have a depression but also international frenzy feeding like China. Also after a depression or empire collapse is follow by violence (war)_ Another gem on the internet produced by the Great Dalio_ The wisdom and clarity with which Ray speaks is truly amazing!

Reason is not ‚Äúcabin fever‚Äù but generational vicious circle. Someday hopefully sooner than later there will be a general notion what really is going wrong: \"If parents cannot live together, is there any power that would let children learn to live?\" There could be! Change in actions taken must happen at early preschool level. It is serious place that is mostly skipped because of......?  There is the age(1.5 - 4y) where all those homeless people are created. As well a bunch of sociopaths is created in case they had \"good\" home without parental presence or healthy rewarding behavior. It is generational vicious circle and society easily could cut in and repair it if just wanted. Knowledge is there. All is needed is to change the quality and quantity and respect of preschool operation._ Great interview! Especially because you let the Speaker Speak!_ We should remove the current University and college system for an electronic system that is accessible by whomever wishes to access it the only exclusive college education should be the newest information available which may include National Security issues_ Capitalism isn't broken our education system is what is broken  we shouldn't have to spend five times as much to get good quality education ..the diplomas and certifications have become a form of control.. real information education should not be expensive or unavailable to those who wish to receive it_ üòÇ nice try_ Deborah Tavares._ Nothing but respect for Mr Dalio but I hope he is wrong on his view point._ https://youtu.be/kUF3om4PNWg.

We sincerely hope that whole world will soon leave this crisis behind and enter into recovery phase._ this video is a great part 2 to this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggkI12SYsN8&t=57s_ First he is not the brain behind his fund's investments, so to interview him is like interviewing a manager or salesmen. He is juts a salesmen for his business who never liked the look of cash that was not handed to him to invest. He is always gets paid whether you won or lost. So his song is always the same. He will never tell you (not even now): Get out of this market Now! All his predictions of the great depression are written on the wall. Everyone knows it , but prefers to sleepwalk until they cannot ignore it any longer. I learned NOTHING from this video that I did not already know. Sad._ Great insights_ What coronavirus means for the global economy? \n\n\n\nThe need for economic distancing with China._ Of the three commodities unique to liberal/capitol markets (money, labor, and real estate) which in the short term will have the most comparative value ?_ Ray is excellent as usual. The interviewers leave a lot to be desired._ So the solution to this problem is more debt, greater consumption of already limited resources and increased trust in a system that has repeatedly failed. Fair play lads, the worlds already fucked; we don‚Äôt have the resources to make a bigger pie without destroying the planet. We need to divide the current pie more equally, tax the rich and help the poor with that. We need a far more socialist society!_ The difference between a rich and a poor student isn‚Äôt just a computer, it is a safe and structured home life._ An economic collapse will affect EVERYONE and cause (directly and indirectly) more deaths than a virus that only targets the elderly and vulnerable._ Innovators will win... what will you be doing to innovate, shift, and take advantage of this time?_ Way, way, way too boring!!_ Ray Dalio has vast interests in China. His bridge water fund is a large investor in China and of course he stands for his Chinese interests. I think we really need to take a grain of salt while listening to his opinion regarding China since he is a big stake holder of good relationships with the Chinese communist party leaderships._ In the economy without credit, the only way to increase your spending is to produce more. - Seems fair enough to me, there is no such thing as free lunch, you want something, go and produce it.\r\n\r\nMoney should be backed by real productivity, earned by real productivity - this is good money. When the money is created out of thin air, the creator of money is cheating everyone's productivity by inflation. Do not get me wrong, it is okay for credit to exist, to borrow money. But money should be lent by someone who earned it by being productive, not by creating it out of thin air. So in the end lender is shifting his purchasing power (or his result of being productive) onto the borrower, but in the entire economy the purchasing power stays the same, because no money was created and the credit was created out of existing money, not from money created out of thin air.\r\n\r\nThis is what you need remember:\r\ngood money = earned by productivity or borrowing it from someone who earned it by being productive;\r\nbad money = created out of thin air not backed by real productivity and putting a burden of inflation on everybody (without their consent) who is already productive;\r\ngood debt = backed by good money;\r\nbad debt = backed by bad money;\r\n\r\nSo in the end, in this fraudulent system of privately owned bank called with public name of Federal Reserve Banking creating money out of thin air, it is not about being productive, it is about knowing, which assets will be inflated (increasing in price) after their money creation process. Yeah, and we are here not even talking about fractional reserve banking by commercial banks, which is creating even more money out of thin air._ We need independence from China_ Thank you 33:17_ Is Ray ready to part with his wealth lol I think not!_ I also noted that, but he knows it, because he later signals the need of establish the reality that there is a basic level of access to education and healt care under which nobody should fall._ Brooklyn's lastIrishman absolutely._ Agent Upgrade an app that prints money_ It's means the taxpayers being robbed again trillions trillions trillions given to the big businesses again thats what it really means_ Unfortunately, Mr Dalio only perpetuates the polarization of arguments in general by speaking in bifurcated terms of the discussion surrounding the economic crisis we will be facing globally as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Referring repeatedly to \"both sides\" of the issues surrounding the discourse, and even alluding to how those who can see both sides are not being encouraged to do so. He seems to contradict himself as well, when toward the end of the interview he espouses collective decision making, when just minutes before, while responding to Ms. Hajim's question about better acknowledgement of the lower level workers of the world, those who actually are essential and who keep the world running, he extolled the inevitability of the differentially rewarded hierarchical arrangement of society. The framing of arguments as two sided, of agreements as bilateral, perpetuates the polarization of political discourse, as it only gives the opportunity to agree with one side or the other. It seems we would be better served if we started speaking in ways that acknowledge the nuances of issues, in ways that allow multiple perspectives to be brought to the fore, and through media that allow many voices the opportunity of an equitable seat at the table when issues are defined and when policies to address them are created. I heard nothing concrete from Mr. Dalio about how we are going to create this new economic pie that has more equitable slices for everyone at the table. I heard a more more immediate and easily achievable plan from Vic DiBettito ( https://youtu.be/GLcNStHTDjM ) on how to assist the needs of the people of this country right now in achieving that end. I think Mr. DiBettito also more succinctly underscores the problems inherent in how the system currently operates both corporately and governmentally, and how they will perpetuate their continued and minimally altered coexistence. Softer, gentler corporate capitalism is analogous only to a more benevolent slave owner, it makes a difference only as a matter of degree of suffering of the slaves, not one of freedom and enfranchisement._ You guys had a great mind go to his \"usual routine\"...\n1. Alot of \"insight\" fluffed over with idealistic answers. \n2. The questions were vague, \"high-interest\" questions that led Ray to answer in a safe bubble. \n3. He hedged on a few things...namely \"depression\", \"uh-assets-for-if you think-this-system-breaks-down\" (hmmm...what could that B(TC)?)\n\n\nIf were going to continue to ask Ray Dalio \"tell us your insights\"...we should expect idealistic answers that pontificate his research....great...where does that get us? \n\n\nInspired? \nHopeful? \n\n\nI look forward to granular conversations that roadmap the change we can take TODAY. \nAction-targeted qustions: \n\"Ray, what can the average american do today to build a fortress around their investments?\" \n\"Go Cash, Buy Inflation Protection, Avoid Speculation in what caused the debt crisis...stocks\"\n\n\nTED should look at finding professionals inside the industry to probe other professionals inside the industry. \n\n\nIf you don't agree...\n\n\nWhat other than hope and inspiration did YOU WALK AWAY WITH after this video? \n\n\nPlease innovate, TED...the 2007 blueprint is just  that...13 years old. \n\n\nCheers from a loyal watcher :) Miguel_ Implied message- you must first lift yourself up before you can lift anyone else up. But in order to lift yourself up, you must be given the opportunity to do so._ I just lost a ton of respect for this guy. He's a self proclaimed globalist, but seems completely oblivious to the consequences of such centralized power. And thinks that capitalism needs fixing because the haves get everything at the expense of the have nots. His economic understanding is poor af for such a respected pontificator on global economics._ Patented by Bill Gates 26.3.2020\r\n\"a brain wave or body heat emitted from the user when the user performs the task provided by an information or service provider, such as viewing advertisement or using certain internet services, can be used in the mining process.

Antonio from Rome_ The interviewers are on a different wavelength, completely missing the reality and magnitude of the situation that faces us, \nlooking at things through rose tinted glasses. The effects on the world economy will be felt for decades to come, Ray does not sugarcoat this, something akin to the Marshall plan is needed,  a certain amount of cohesiveness between different countries is required to achieve this, sadly at a time of our least cohesive globally.The order of things as they have been for the last 70 years will change dramatically._ Ray Dalio is incredible, with obvious virtues in business and for humanity._ All these material things on earth will be burned; the world will pass away.

I am afraid that many want more simplicity and clarity even in these uncertain times_ i feel there is a MAJOR disconnect between the interviewers & Ray. can the interviewers listen & comprehend before speaking?_ Why is this so boring_ Adapt + Invent + Innovate \n\nWe all need each other\nLet‚Äôs love one another \nYou are my sister, you are my Brother!\n\n:DK_ what does he mean by holes in income?_ https://youtu.be/qei0aY2vww8_ The problem is that we are stupid investors._ just have eric x li back again, or zhang weiwei_ Read Schumpeter about creative destruction. The Austrian economist coined the term nearly a century ago and it absolutely applies today. While the virus is the catalyst,  the weak and inefficient and corrupt elements of society will be destroyed and we will emerge stronger on the other side. The problem is that getting to the other side is painful and unsettling and while we all want to be there, most of us don't want to endure the journey to get there._ I keep going back to Andrew Yang's world view which may have been closer to the real mechanics of what is going on than others._ Why do we need to work and pay tax if money can be printed?_ The dollar is going under. Governments all over the world are scrambling to buy gold. Oil is in the negative. These are the signs that the dollar will no longer be the reserve currency. Russia and China both are pulling out of the dollar. We will see hyperinflation and the dollar wont buy anything when this is fully conceived. Cant be fixed at this point the damage is done. Only a matter of time now. It is why they are talking about a digital currency. China is already working on that for themselves._ There is no other path forward for humanity to evolve!_ like any system it can't be good or bad, it's the people who use it in evil and destructive ways. If you really think about, capitalism might have been the greatest thing that happened to mankind, but evil people turned it into something that will kill us all. Of course if we look at capitalism from the point of view of a world that was already evolving into this big-societies-nations-countries kind of thing. In general the world would be a better place if only there were not 8 bilion people, but a 100 milion, and we would all live as farmers, hunters & artists in little communities in the middle of forests.\nBut as the world began to be one great human sandbox, at it's roots the capitalism could have been a cure to all problems (by creating more resources, and allowing more competitive/inventive way of work) humanity was facing before. It only later became a system where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, where people like Bezos or Zuckerberg, and all the other Rockefellers of this world could make their own happiness making use of all the people who didn't have as much luck.\nSorry if my thought process isn't clear, I'm not an English native speaker_ Any alternative?_ @javierlandry7246¬† alternative to what? \nCapitalism?_ It's hard for him to make decisive calls because the news is just going to turn it into a clickbait headline_ Yeah It's called Ping_ Because it doesn't include Special Effects..._ We can't be beat!_ If people don't spend you don't get income._ Because we need productivity to create valuable assets. If the monetary offer is bigger than the production, money devaluates and loses its value. Printing money is no substitute of income, it serves for reducing the debt. That doesn't create inflation on goods._ \"Radical Transparency\" He is a new world order money changer who works against the American people....\nHe tells you over and over the New world order. I thought that was for conspiracy theory nuts?_ VAGUE WAFFLE_ It's great to have Ray Dalio share his insight in this less stringent format._ 35:00  Ray says that China is helping out.  tRump is going to be successful in pissing off China to the point where they will just shun us for much needed supplies.  China has factories, we have paper money which is going downhill.  We cannot change a supply chain in 4 years.  Moreover, China has an educated population._ Interesting documentary about COVID cover up    https://youtu.be/3bXWGxhd7ic_ It means peace and quiet for a change_ Chris should have stayed off the call. Ray is a joy though_ Ray Dalio is a corporate socialist hack that never did anything for anyone without selfish reasons. He's a bailout scumbag taking our tax money for his greed. Oh but he has donated to charities (as a tax write off)._ Appreciate the helpful insight!!!! Many thanks!!!!üëçüèºüíØüòÉ_ I m from Italy, what I can say.... Ray for president!_ ‚ÄúMoney and credit is just digital‚Äù - Ray just gave the order. Let‚Äôs moon boys._ This guy is the same as Bill Gates he is saying what is going to happen because the elite has everything planned. Money moves the world and so they can steer the direction through big corporations. He loves the phrase \"new world order\" & he says it with so much confidence. If the world where chaotic & random there is no way he could know the future. The economy is not open & free. It is closed and controlled by a few who are in the top. Why can the future just be a descentralized system, open & free where anyone can participate? (like Bitcoin has demonstrated). There is no need for a new world order in which few people control everything. Ray Dalio is in the top, remember that, he is not your mate. He is fighting for his own selfish interests as the majority of people are. Brake the spell.\n\nI'll leave you some good links with valuable information.\nInvestigate, make your own conclusion. Don't let this people in the top dictate our future. They are becoming more and more rich empoverishing us.

Honestly it is incredible.  Let the wise man finish his thought!_ Agreed_ @RafaSyed¬† Yes completely. Ray Dalio have turned on the \"long light\" and the interviewer just need a \"stock pick\" for the next week._ Absolutely agree! Every interview with Ray I have watched so far was the interviewer having a monologue :)_ I wish all interviewers were like her. I fear the US corporate media has dumbed-down citizens to the point that we will never elect a capable leader like Roosevelt or Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew._ Because you're not watching CNN or MSNBC._ indeed_ \"[Capitalism] as it exists today is, in my opinion, the real source of evils. I am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils, namely through the establishment of a socialist economy, accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals. In such an economy, the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion.\"\n-Albert Einstein_ Books in Review Yet here we are, in Ray‚Äôs words, in the same long term market downturn that happens every 75 years or so.

As long as there are human egos, greed, etc there will never be a perfect gov system._ @thickerthoughts9107¬† human greed will always be there, just as love and compassion will always be there.

I d like to know how we are ready for thinking in a new way, to avoid the mistakes of the past, Are we enough evolved? or we keep on doing our own interests and destroying the planet ?_ @user-ss6pf8ld2l¬† socialism probably works with human nature way more than capitalism does tbh. It only takes a month or so to kill the feeling of want and greed._ Ha ha ha..!! but they have rewritten as thoughtful disagreement in subtitle._ like that game with the split/not split? we already have experiments on reactions of ppl to this situations, from what you sow in that show, are both sides will be honest?\nlove from ISR._ And dems never are._ If people were intellectually honest liberalism wouldnt exist._ So if I set your house on fire, take your water then come over and give it back you should thank me for helping out._ When they say \"buy gold\", what does this mean?... like my necklace jewelry or gold bars?... someone please...?....üòäüòä_ Why is the sound level so varying?

Anyone heard of the California teachers' union?_ Ray Dalio mentions \"Rebuilding our Nation with Creativity\".  We don't need a rebuilding we need a \"Re-branding the American dream\" and that will require us to vet out all the corrupt money lobbied politicians and place term limits on them all, bring back all the jobs our multi-nationals sent overseas for the last 30 years, forced removal of all illegal immigrants, remove our excess consumption habits on the Chinese teet, close the IRS loopholes to offshore money,  reboot the SBA and force them to empower small businesses loans (<50 employees).  U.S. govt to nationalize any company that violates any one of these re-branding strategies and 50% of the value of these nationalized companies will have a long term transfer mechanism in making them entirely employee owned companies.  How's that for creativity?_ I can say thank you. Thank you Chinese communist government for destroying our lives and our economy._ As powerful as he is, is Mr. Dali willing to gather a group of highly influential businessmen and other groups come together to make a difference, to press pressure to the government to make the right decision_ The clarity of thoughts is just amazing!!_ If we, all american understand what Ray said, American will be great again!_ Money without wisdom is futile._ Why do we believe the debt will be paid off at all? As he speaks in terms of balance sheets, whatever is carried on the government's books as a liability is carried on private books as an asset. In fact, this is one of the fundamental premises of Modern Monetary Theory, which is where we're really headed. I suppose the real question to me is to what degree was a $1.25 trillion increase or roughly 8% in the M2 inflationary given that the velocity of the money supply undoubtedly shrank at more than twice that rate during the lock down?_ What Ray meant, I think, is that pandemic is a trauma force that triggers the wolrd economy in its intrinsic periodicals. Intrinsicly, the factors like money, credits and production are setting in one way of the other. If no pandemic, the factors restting for new trends in its intrinsic manner. Pandemic only speed up the restting, and may only take 2-3 years for the market to restructure for next. In the restructure, we only know who has the money in his balance sheet may take advantage in the resetting turmoil._ Bill Gates want you dead:\nPatent number: 10130701\n\nAbstract: The present invention provides a live, attenuated corona virus comprising a variant replicase gene encoding polyproteins comprising a mutation in one or more of non-structural protein(s) (nsp)-10, nsp-14, nsp-15 or nsp-16.

The people who want things to ‚Äúgo back to nomal‚Äù in a few weeks time are not thinking rationally, listen to Ray and not the backwards thinkers._ Can you help me, why are so many people in the comment section calling ray a con man ?_ buy physical gold if you can afford it and have somewhere to put it. or buy stocks of gold mining companies. or buy a gold etf._ Yes, I did and I realised just how much worse off we would have been right now if his policies were actually executed._ Thanks to your subprime 2008 crisis._ @javierlandry7246¬† I'm talking about a pandemic and lying about it._ Accusations don't make them guilty._ @javierlandry7246¬† Hahaha, \"accusations\". Fact._ Investors like him, while talking causalities, don't necessarily think in the true causality. They think in what ever coorelations are in their experience. The truth is, theri experience are pretty much how the history has been happening. Even if the causalities that he make here isn't sounding, the correlations are correct. Trust him._ Ray should be the president._ Man Ray Dalio just simplify everything.\nThe man is a legend and a great mentor!_ Paper money bubble is about to burst. That is the next phase and post corona virus situation. Put your savings in bitcoin, gold, silver and land. Islam says the same and Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) has predicted this time and its coming. Be in the community who treat you as a family no matter what religion they follow and what belief they have, but as they live as a family, so yeah, go ahead._ These interviewers were sub par...it would be like jesus being interviewed by gilligan and mrs howell_ Can i have a summary please?_ It's nonsense that Hitler came into power over a wealth gap. He even not gained the majority of votes in 1933. The Power was given to him from the president Paul von Hindenburg (that's why Germanys president today have only a representative function and sign laws on the state level). The wealthy people and industry supported Hitler. After 1933 he changed a lot with a increasing speed and no one could stop him until Germany blow off. The whole \"wealth gap\" thing from Ray comes from a leftist perspective._ I wonder how Greed plays in to the redistribution of wealth..._ What happened to \"cash is trash\" comment Ray? Very bad call, don't listen to this man unless you want to lose money._ FAWNING INTERVIEWERS TALKING IN PLATITUDES AS IS DALIO. CLEARLY HE IS IN THE CORRIDORS OF POWER MASSAGING ALL THE RIGHT PEOPLE SO HE DOESN'T GET HIS FORTUNE MAULED BY THE TAX COLLECTOR. BY THE WAY, ALL THIS \"PHILANTHROPY\" IS JUST A WAY OF GETTING AROUND THE TAX MAN. DALIO KNOWS THAT CRONY CAPITALISM AND GOVERNMENT LARGESSE CREATED THESE PROBLEMS IN THE FIRST PLACE AND THAT THE WEALTH DISPARITY IS CAUSED BY ASSET PRICE INFLATION DUE TO FED MONEY EASING, AND CLEARLY HE JUST WANTS TO BE ANOTHER BENEFICIARY OF IT... THAT'S WHY HE'S IN THE CORRIDORS OF POWER: SO HE CAN BE CLOSER TO THE MONEY TAP..._ Spread the word. Arm in arm marches through downtown streets. \"No more Scam Plandemic!\"_ He's being way too scared and indirect to speak what he wants to speak._ I dont understand any of it_ The white middle class gets stuck paying for everything. This is what people like Dalio will never understand. We pay for the those who control the money, the poverty people who receive billions of dollars in government, social and philanthropic money and we pay for other people's govt pensions. There is no money for the middle class. the major contributors to the economic success of this country are becoming extinct. Once people become wealthy they lose site of everything and pander to the lower class to make he selves feel heroic. This pandemic is accelerating the diminishment of entrepreneurs and creatives, the very people Dalio claims will save the  world. More needs to be done now to support and save the middle class now._ Sorry Corey but the 'average' person doesn't have their money in passive investments if we're talking about society as a whole_ Excelente documento para estos momentos.

Don't you think?_ He is paid millions a month to use his knowledge in \"bold\" and \"direct\" ways of investment. You think he's going to give it for free?_ You didn't get the point. If that's the case who is forcing him on a gunpoint to give any interviews. He's probably afraid of stereotyped to premeditate something that hasn't yet happened to which he doesn't benefit at all._ Dalio said this economic situation will be worse than 2008. I don't think it gets any more direct than that. It is important to be careful regarding what is said when so much is at stake._ @csax4056¬† You didn't get the point that you can be informative and helpful while not giving away the specific information that is not only the source of your business but also the responsible for its success._ @Mister.Unknown¬† All the top top tier expert celebrities don't come on reputed media and social media outlets for charity. They are building a brand for themselves by sharing in depth trends and understanding of what's  happening and going to happen. Hes not the only one in the finance hedge fund space sharing thoughts about what's happening or the path forward, there are many many more.\nNow I felt he could have explained what's about to come in the economy, industry, sector specific general understanding, China situation etc. because we don't listen to these people to add numbers to their trp tally but real value. You are happy with vague broad statements, maybe I expected more. Now I regularly follow a lot of podcasts in the finance tech space and I felt he was being way too scared to say anything. That's my point of view, if you don't like it, please don't preach human psychology and PR lessons but learn to 'agree to disagree'._ Yeah kinda feel he is very cautious about what he is trying to express.

If we'll agreed that money isn't worth anything they we could transition to a resource based economy that's goal is to protect the environment and stop endless consumption and waste._ ~If something totally free and naturally abundant, (like pine-cones or dandy-lions) were discovered to be effective for testing, curing, or immunizing covid-19, do you believe governments or media would allow the spreading of such information?_ I love Ray Dalio_ There are opportunities in this crisis. Cruise ships are not dumping millions of gallons of sewage into the ocean. Factories are not spewing so much filth into the air. 8 billion aren't people aren't consuming unchecked. Everybody is so focused on the 'damage' the lockdowns have done, but the greater good is actually being served. The sky is bluer in April than it was in March. Leave the oil in the ground._ This guys responses are like a politician.\nVery little talk of the monster in the room - The Federal Reserve.\nThey are  printing trillions of dollars, produced  from thin air & flooding them into the economy.\nThey are buying private assets with this funny money and giving it out to whom they see fit.\nWhatever happened to common sense & practical answers to questions so that the people can unferstand what is actually going on._ So I guess Ted talks always open with fake applause_ Love Ray's talk.. truly inspirational.. we need political leader like him.._ In this interview you realize that even the most wealthy amongst us such as Ray have literally no clue where the world is going next.

He and others like him are so immersed in seeking advantage in the present game they may not even recognize the possibility of change._ Many changes both positive and negative have been piling up since human civilizations last political and economic paradigm was set. We have. exited the age of scarcity and entered into an age of plenty. Our economics of Capitalism which prided itself on turning a negative human trait (greed) into a positive can no longer efficiently organize human productive capacity into a system that maximizes the good for humanity. Our sclerotic political systems based on democracy no longer have the ability to defeat the corrosive effect of overly concentrated wealth to the point that wealth defeats the very purpose of democracy.\n\nIt is time for a new era of managed economies. The purchasing power necessary for our economy to function should be a distribution to each person of a sum certain with no work or education requirements. Additional work should be allowed to those who wish it with additional remuneration. Huge profits accumulated by those who through expertise and/or luck should be pared down to reasonable levels by draconian taxes at least as great as those of my childhood (92%).\n\nRaw intelligence and ability should once again be the sole measure of one's worth to the economic machinery.

That was almost word salad.  Yes we all understand how things changed under FDR... state your obvious points and lay it out simply then expand on it.  That was like listening to a senile uncle on 3 pints of beer._ It's great news for the power elite as they consolidate all of their assets a la their great depression coup. 2007/2008 etc. Hang the banksters. End the Fed._ TED should hold debates_ This next 16 months is going to feel like the greatest economic stress test we face during most our lifetimes, only for us to realise in a decade or two that it was not even remotely comparable to Climate Crisis and AI [and changes AI would bring]. The troubling part of it being that we probably won't take enough actions until those threats become more imminent and tangible, by then which it's almost definitely way too late._ Her voice pierced my ears._ I find the question \"do you think this is a threat to the financial industry\" a red herring. I thought the key point of capitalism is that it is adaptive to changing market conditions. So if a financial  institution is unfit to weather an economic storm, perhaps it has outlived the usefulness of its existence (i.e. demand for its services, or its capability to provide supply)._ Globalism is a joke, building everything in China is not globalism, it is monopoly._ Create and invent. If I leave my house I'm a criminal. The enemy has but a short time. New world. Wtf_ Ray Dalit superstar, love him so good.üå∫üå∫God bless you all, United we stand._ Ray Dalio made some effort to dodge one of the questions posed by one of the interviewers, which was related to whether we need to reevaluate the comparative value placed on the work of what are now called \"essential workers\", but in the past whose roles have been designated as low skilled occupations._ Worth every minute, thanks TED and Ray. By absolute chance I just watched a fantastic Ray Dalio infographic clip moments earlier, which others might find helpful to have a clearer understanding of the things he talks to in the beginning of this video. Here's the link: https://youtu.be/PHe0bXAIuk0_ We never got out of the last recession. It was all manipulated information to make people think we did. This is just the icing on the cake and a huge crash is coming._ I just wanted to come and listen to a few points from this but I couldn't get my self to pull away. Very engaging and succinct points. Ray Dalio is the GOAT._ WOW, Ray is not only one of the best investors, but also the most wise peacekeeper and forward-looking visionary leader in the world. We need to listen to him more._ great insights from the experts but my question is will the economy stabilize after this coronavirus ?_ They just use a virus that comes any year in order to make money by crashing economy.  It s just a criminal scam._ What a load of crap. Come on Ted, you can do better_ You thought wrong. Most people think that's what capitalism about. Thats why we are fked. People don't even care if money is fake. They already believe in a man in the sky so fake money sounds pretty tame. We are fucked_ Capitalism can‚Äôt work when It is forcibly shut down._ Did you know you can create a new business without leaving your home?_ Ray said it will take time it could possibly take a couple of years..._ https://youtu.be/ZrTL0FZwET0\nLets make the world rise again by supporting local businesses_ You an't seem nothing yet.  I will have to give up my cell phone if we have 5G._ WHO said \"The team from WHO, including American experts, was given access to all information they needed in China back in mid-Feb\", I guess the failure of the US government is very obvious and the failure was the CDC couldn't get the test kit ready for months_ Asking a billionaire how bad this is and how worried we should be is the dumbest thing you can do. \n\nWhat a joke. I cant even watch another second of this dumb video._ The old system of competition has run its course. The only way civilization advances beyond this time period is to realize that we all benefit by initializing a system of cooperation, not competitiveness._ Protect this man at all costs. Great interview Ray_ He was going well then he flubbed the question on front-line workers getting a greater slice of the pie.  Then he sounded like just another rich man who wants to keep his Billions._ Nothing can be achieved with Democrats in power. They just care for abortion,lgbtqp, open the borders and giving away money to minorities._ Sounds awfully like somebody has a dog in this fight...Cui Bono?_ Consequences of the scamdemic? Neo feudalism as it was designed to be. The Fed & Central Banks & their friends will own everything of value, the rest will be left to the peasants who will be using the tracked, coded & surveilled ''Fed Coin\"...coming to all the middle & working classes soon._ Look. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZI0JJXIRUw&t=1920s Right now FED is bailing out big financial corporations and shadow banks as BlackRock. They are not bailing you out - but the biggest and most fraudulant organisations instead of letting them bankrupt and let the good firms to survive. They put more fuel to the fire.\n\n\nI like Mr Ray Dalio, because he was always decent and is bringing understanding and solutions, not doing more of the same mistakes over and over again on biggest scale as the private megacorporation called FED is doing._ Dalio is a tedious and ignorant bore.    That's why he has a fan club of really clueless people.    The capitalist world wide system of economics is crashing, and the guy is too dull to even mention that.    He has no understanding of ecology at all_ Does anyone see the irony in him talking about people in power and the people who pull the leavers, and him being one of those people? It's pretty easy for someone in his position to espouse the ideas he has. To not take a side and pat himself and others like him on the back and say, look at all this good we are doing. Great you got a bunch of people computers and are helping some with education. That doesn't change the system that causes those problems and his and those like him's wealth directly comes from that system. Until that fundamentally changes his actions are just a self aggrandizing bandaid. It's a huge problem always looking to the rich, who perpetuate the system that is the problem, as some saviors cause they throw a bit of money here and there to make themselves feel better about benefiting from this broken system.\n\nI would have liked them to throw some much more challenging questions his way. This felt more like a promo for him and his ideas than any real deep dive. But I've been disappointed in TED for years, so not sure what I was expecting_ How in the world is the SPY pushing $300 again, Ray?_ Ray Dalio for president!!!_ So I'm Wealthy and I have resources. Yet all the resources that should be distributed to the have nots. Stays at the top to those who have and are not in need. Yet the rich frown at the poor. But the virus doesn't see wealth or color. Plus the face of Vanity, is no more! But the face of wearing a Mask is for all.üòâ_ Brilliant talk. Principles on R.D.'s LinkedIn  sound interesting._ Is it me or is she asking the same questions that have the same answers overall?_ Incredible discussion! Thanks for sharing!_ Who can list all the books in Ray's bookshelf?_ OMFG please focus the one talking....... deerp_ I‚Äôd prefer a Peter Schiff interview._ Corey nods too much lol_ He is so right cash is trash and no I won't give up my trash_ When a person comes out and says ‚Äúwe can enlarge de pie and share it better‚Äù, they are completely disconnected to reality. We cannot continue to grow at current rates, and that pie (albeit very concentrated), cannot continue to grow. Of course a mega wealthy man will completely throw away the planet to satisfy his needs. Also, it‚Äôs quite funny that we always equate economic success with intelligence. If they are rich, they are smart, period._ OK, we'll come out of this, but will it happen in my lifetime?_ All the reason to transition to a resource based economy. Right now, we rely on rich people to create a product at the cheapest price, therefore they need employees that will work for almost nothing. This increases the bottom line for share holders. It is vicious cycle. The rising power should be the citizens. The citizens should perform self governing. We always think that other wealthy and highly educated people need to be making all of the critical decisions. He forgets to explain how the tax rates for the rich went to 92% during the depression. The tax rates now are 1/4 of that. We think the rich must have these lower rates because we are totally dependent on their generosity, through employment. But, the rich fought the government tooth and nail to get these low tax rates. The government were scared to death of a real revolution during the great depression. The people were fed up and willing to do desperate things against our government during the great depression. In a resource based economy, we would not rely on rich people for employment. Money would be obsolete. No business owners would worry, because the citizens would control every aspect of our society. He talks about the economy as a game. Like a chess game? Are we the pawns? Is that what the citizens want? Why should we let rich people have the power. They play games and we are the losers. Isn't that the way it's done? For profit economies just do not work. Who gets into trouble in bad economic times? We do! There is just so much, we as citizens can take. Globalization, idealism and other bullshit terminology. Practical questions? Is he high? What is he talking about? Why does he mention War? Who is evil? Demonization? What? American Dream? What? Why does he mention power? Why? War? Adequate school systems. He said it. Profit systems do not work! How do you make them productive? Don't just give the citizens money. He is so confused. It could be so simple. With the Pandemic, we would function normally and our society will still operate for the benefit of it's citizens. Monetary polices, financial systems, markets, recovery, debt crisis, GDP, banking systems, algorithms and other structures are just ways to confuse the citizens. If the citizens actually knew what power they really have and how simple it would be in a resourced base society, they would really effect a world wide revolution and take back the power they gave the governments that enslave them. Restructuring? Bullshit. The constitution should be updated after we kick our government out of Washington DC. It should read the following:\n\n\nRepresentative Government is hereby abolished\nThe production and use of money is hereby abolished\nThe citizens shall Review, Create and Amend Laws\nThe precepts of the Declaration of Independence will dictate how our society functions \nAll areas of our society shall be controlled directly by the citizens._ China helped out by closing down Wuhan and keeping their airports open long enough to infect the rest of the world.....That was so helpful... don't you think?_ Doesn't globalization just mean our sourcing American jobs to other countries, and making American workers compete with the worst sweat shops everywhere in the world?_ I am worried about my 401K. I'm counting on my advisers to invest this in the best way possible, because I don't know how to do it. After listening to a little over half of this, I feel like whether or not I wind up living on the street, depends more on chance than anything else. From my point of view anyway. Not a good feeling._ \"It will be VERY different, there will be a new world order\"-Dalio_ In Ray's \"Principles\" series video \"How the Economy Works\"  he said the long-term debt cycle was 75-100 years. Here he says 50-75 years and identifies the 1945 Bretton-Woods Agreement as a deleveraging event.  \n\n\nAren't the Great Depression, including the roaring 20s and the austerity of Hoover and Coolidge, and the 1970s stagflation crisis, including the Nixon Shock and the rise of Neo-Conservatism (with faces like Reagan and Thatcher) the events we should be reviewing? That's more like 44 year long-term debt cycles, which is like a Biblical Jubilee cycle when you discount the Sabbath years: 42 working years in a 50 calendar year cycle._ Ray is clearly a clever and brilliant man of finance. PERIOD. While his philanthropy is good, as a former educator I think he misses the mark. Ray is a man without a body - he has no sense of Nature's time table - which has NOTHING to do with our financial markets and gives no mind to them. And she is on a tear now. Markets are as ephemeral as our dreams. They are make-believe. While the polar ice caps melt at unprecedented speeds. The man / woman I want to hear speak is an environmentalist or a farmer who takes care of the land. We should be investing in planting trees. PERIOD. We should be paying people to plant trees. PERIOD. And the pay should be GREAT and should be done in communities around the globe. As Jane Goodall makes clear - it is a third of the solution to climate change. We clearly have the make believe money to manifest anything now, even Ray says this. So that's no longer an issue ... let's get started. A GREEN NEW DEAL NOW. And here's my website with SOLUTIONS you can take NOW www.therealrevolution.org_ 40:35 Ray's gonna start shaking his head. I'm not sure he really thinks unskilled laborers are heroes. He pivots to how everyone getting skills and performing their roles excellently and with good cooperation is essential for a healthy economy._ And not receiving a stimulus check! What a joke. MERICA!_ Here I am 47 years old...a small town in poor Mississippi. I have owned a womens clothing boutique for 21 years living with a terrible neurological disease...narcolepsy....auto immune. I know how to run a small mom & pop business. But I noticed years ago Wal-Mart will take over mom & pop shops. It's sad because we won't have a city without small local businesses. But here they are about to kill it! I am a fighter & will fight back for sure but dam! I'm pissed_ I wish Ray Dalio would buy a big piece of land and start a new country. I'd immigrate there in a heartbeat._ Regional capitalism is a good path forward. LOCALIZATION is the key to addressing economic social justice, climate change and financial independence from BIG BANKS, fossil fuels, etc. www.thelocalrevolution.org_ Cash is trash. Especially when Fed is pumping trillions and diluting the cash pool._ It's a whole crisis that we're all going through together and it's China's fault!_ You are absolutely right. But he thinks very highly of himself and with such an amount of honey on his accounts you must not wonder. Most of present mankind is infected by capitalist thought and therefore there will be no fundamental change yet. But there is really no one to blame. That is just our point of time in history. No one likes changes. We don't want to give up our ways of live. Things really have to to go very bad before we might reconsider. But bo matter what, history will move on. So, let's hope for the best._ It's a decade like any recession._ Just another puppet, preparing peoples minds. I have zero respect for this villain.\n\nThis guy is the same as Bill Gates. He is saying what is going to happen because the elite has everything planned. Money moves the world and so they can steer the direction through big corporations. He loves the phrase \"new world order\" & he says it with so much confidence. If the world where chaotic & random there is no way he could know the future. The economy is not open & free. It is closed and controlled by a few who are in the top. Why can the future just be a descentralized system, open & free where anyone can participate? (like Bitcoin has demonstrated). There is no need for a new world order in which few people control everything. Ray Dalio is in the top, remember that, he is not your mate. He is fighting for his own selfish interests as the majority of people are. Brake the spell.\n\n\nI'll leave you some good links with valuable information.\nInvestigate, make your own conclusion. Don't let this people in the top dictate our future. They are becoming more and more rich empoverishing us.

Being a finger pointer boosts your self esteem?_ Everyone is entitled to their opinions, but say thank you to government that kill their baby girls and make millions orphans and put their parents in prison. A country that put anyone in prison to speak to their rights. A dictatorship  that corrupted so many. Let‚Äôs talk about Tibet, let‚Äôs talk about Taiwan and Hong Kong and everything China does to the people._ Ray Dalio studied history looking for lessons. It's all about cause & effect. Exactly the opposite of 99% of the population who are totally ignorant of history. And most never hold a passport._ absolute claptrap,this systems completely flawed, he trying to cloud peoples reality of the world we live in. The elites manipulate everything the masses always gain very little as always.....pure exploitation nothing changes, the system stinks because its deliberately unfare & planned that way by the elites, its a rigged game all he,s talking is the usual  useful  educated idiot bollocks._ Ray Dallo doesn't allow for the new regime that pits both the government and the corporate elite against the people. Previous situations had a strong independent government to rely upon where now the government is completely owned by the corporate elite and they are not about to relinquish their strangle hold on the capital wealth like they were forced by the government to do in the last depression. This time the people are on their own and this depression will last until the people rise up in a French style revolution or a Russian one or even a British one. The people are once again on their own and nothing will improve until the people rise up on mass to throw down the people who control the money. This time it's the corporate elite. With France, Britain and Russia it was the kings. The result will be the same; a violent of the vast majority of the people will rise up and fight the corporate elite. This time the police and the army my not support the people though; they may actually support the corporate elite. If that happens the end result will be a return to modern form of three class society; the corporate elite as the ruling class, the poverty stricken people and the militarized police and military. With their modern weapons if the police and the military don't support the people they will be doomed to an era of peasantry with most of their leaders killed off and no hope for a whole generation until a new batch of leaders grow up and learning from the deaths of their fathers will form a guerrilla army similar to Cuba's to fight the oppression.  But fight they will do and this time they will find that many of the police and the military will join them having seen the destruction of a generation of the murderess elitist criminals._ 49:08 WHAT... WAS THAT?_ I wonder what happens to all the college grad's in May, can't get jobs, no choice but to default on their loans... \nThere is going to be a mass implosion of all goods requiring loans (homes,cars,etc) for at least 6-7yrs due to $hit credit scores...\nIf there is a time to basically forgive all student loans, it is now.  Otherwise this downturn will go decades... #BernieKnew_ He knows it's all a scam,  a Ponzi,  a Humungous Debt BUBBLE that was going to burst anyway... but he has to be \"diplomatic\" cause he goes to Davos and has to bow to the REAL powers that be.

These are campaigns to fool common man so that they can preserve their billions and trillions. They are worried that taxes may go up on uber rich...._ Very Knowledgeable Person._ Be aware and be adaptable. Hope for the best, prepare for the worst._ China's history is very dark.\nDon_ You don't need computers for education - come on!  Ray got his education without them..  Education often doesn't happen at school either - especially college!_ Could it be that when universal military service ended people did not know each other in the same way and this led to difficulties.\nDon_ Problem I see is that short-term debt cycle has been overused to produce a lot of things that people don't need immediately (iPhone 11, Google VR headsets, Microsoft Cortana, IOT fridges). At the same time, the Short-term debt cycle has been abused to fuel the purchase of assets that are non-productive, but \"status symbols\" (iPhone 11, etc).\n\n\nThat debt should have been used to create public infrastructures (i.e non-polluting transportation, non-nuclear electric grids, efficient IT systems, malware-resistant tech) and to fund research and development (i.e health advances, environment-friendly policies, Quantum Computing tech). \n\n\nThe result is now that we have economies that has been biting their own tail for the past 11 years: producing, selling, destroying, then reproducing the same but slightly different, then reselling, etc, with nothing worthy being produced for the long-term debt cycle/future generations. \n\n\nWhatever deleveraging we get won't be \"beautiful\" at all. It will be slow, painful and blindfolded. Once again, the burden is left on the shoulders of Millennials to chart new ways and build a sustainable world. Thank you very much for the past decades, Boomers and GenXers, time for you to step aside and stop interfering, so that we can get on with our work._ Biden should put Dalio in a powerful position, or at least as part of a task force to fix capitalism and wealth inequality after, in the election, he spanks the orange toddler-in-chief throwing daily temper-tantrums in white house press beiefings._ Printing of Money... and Redistribution._ Ray seems like he's got early Parkinson's or essential tremor...

Whoa!!!\n\nGotta check the settings for *gremlins*._ Just to finish breaking it down.\nThe U.S. government borrows money for the federal reserve., Which is not owned by the U.S. government. The federal reserve is owned by a private corporation know as the Internal Monetary Fund or IMF. The IMF is a branch of the Rothchilds Bank.

Printing money isn't \"Printing money\" anymore. It's changing digits on a computer._ 27:58 when Ray nearly said btc_ Who is the Marco that he kept mentioning?_ Ray is fucking Clever.._ This crash of the American global system is gong to be glorious. The only questions I have are: will America survive intact, and will what is left roughly resemble Brazil?_ I really enjoyed this talk with Ray, really insightful! However, I have a couple of questions and I would be super grateful if anyone with some knowledge on the topic could share his thoughts on them with me:\n\n\nQuestion 1:¬†Could you please clarify if I understand the current process of printing money correctly?¬†\n¬†\nStep 1: Government increases budget deficit to finance their promises with debt\n¬†\nStep 2: Government tells the Treasury to issue bonds which are then sold to Financial Institutions, mainly commercial banks\n¬†\nStep 3: Commercial banks sell it to Private Investors, and most importantly, to the Central Bank, which buys the bonds with a \"kite cheque\" (newly-printed money)\n¬†\nStep 4: Government spends the freshly printed money on their promises (in the case of the fight with COVID-19 - helicopter money in the US)\n¬†\nStep 5: The public places the money in commercial banks, which then create more money through the fractional reserve system.\n¬†\nMy confusion in here is why the Central Bank has to buy those bonds through such a process and cannot just give the money to the government directly? What is the business for the Central Bank in here?\n¬†\nQuestion 2:¬†What's the limit of money that the government can print?¬†\n¬†\nQuestion 3:¬†Why most of the printed money goes to buying out financial assets? What are the alternatives to distributing the freshly printed money?¬†\n¬†\nQuestion 4:¬†What's the main intention behind printing money through banking the system as it happens today? Hasn't this system created a vicious cycle, which will always make governments to print more money to pay their past debts? Is there an intention to end this process and pay back all debt a country has? What are the limitations in terms of following such money printing policy for the newly acclaimed developed countries (e.g. Poland) and the emerging economies?_ An economy that can't survive a one-month shutdown is not an economy._ Government is not interested in cutting spending or sharing the wealth._ Ma parli inglese o no?_ Thank you for writing that.

Large scale initiatives and planetary threats could then be handled better with better resource and collaboration free of influence from existing regimes or politically structures.

Are you saying that we ignore that. Are you saying we do not hold the CCP and it's members accountable for those lives and the economic damages caused by this CCP party? Are you saying that we are not allowed to sue the CCP and its members to recoup losses caused by the irresponsible actions of this group?

In particular,\nSouth Korea and Taiwan were very effective in getting alerts delivered to the\npublic and moving quickly with the first cases. Here we have the old Emergency\nAlert System on radio and TV, and the WEA system on cellphones which is\nimproving. The IPAWS Improvement Act (US Law 114-143) was signed by President\nObama. However the possible improvements are not being made, and one example is\nthe use of nextgen TV (ATSC 3.0) to deliver alerts to suitable smartphones,\nDependence on cellphones is also an issue as the California wildfires showed,\nwhere selective area delivery via radio or TV could have saved perhaps 100\nlives. The value of EAS was demonstrated in the Samoan tsunami where American\nSamoa had 31 fatalities and Samoa had 149. The difference was primarily due to\nAmerican Samoa having the EAS activated by a radio station operator. In the\ncurrent pandemic, the difference the Emergency Alerting could have made is not\nsimple to estimate, but Taiwan having over 100 cases and one fatality (Mar 19) shows\nthe value of this area of improvement.¬†(addendum) Between Dec 31 and Feb 23 they sent 37 alerts\nand took 76 other actions according to AMA.\n\n\nA meeting with the International Telecommunications Union to discuss the CAP Event Terms list is\nscheduled for September.

His point was that education disparity, which is correlated with income disparity, has become a positive feedback loop that will only get worse and worse and worse without some kind of intervention/reform.

Would FB, GOOGLE and TESLA fit into it?_ By the way Ray, people like you will be greatly devalued and expect a large drop in your value. It will happen over a 5 - 10 year period.  However, healthcare workers, those that do mundane things that are vital to keeping the machinery going will be valued far more. Nevertheless, technological development will probably reduce the need for people. For example, trucking industry will move now more quickly driverless vehicles, doctors will refine and improve telemedicine which will drop the need for some types of staff (although increase other people with specialties).  \n\nBut hedge fund and finance folks - you guys are being realized more and more that you, like Trump, are severely overvalued._ cash is trash_ Note people did find work during the Depression of the 1930's._ Note that in the 19th century there were several Panics which were simply depressions. The difference then was they did not have the monetary programs a developed as they had in the 20th century.  We will go through something like that as we failed to attend to the interaction of healthcare, environment and the health of the individual and its balance with the greater habitat in our monetary policies. So we will be in a situation similar to the 19th century Panics. It will be a ton of trial and error before we see a combination of traditional a novel monetary policies that will work. We will enter a depression for a year and then softened into a recession --- depending on the virus and if we truly address the gaps in our monetary policy we may get out of it in 2 - 3 years._ Thank China???!!!

I believe that people should defy these destructive orders being issued by clueless politicians on power trips!!!_ I have great respect for Ray Dalio, and he's one of the reasons I've made a lot of money in the market. However, he fails to mention the very real threat of a centralized government taking over the entire world. Or maybe it was because of the incompetence of the interviewers' fault. Feds are printing money into oblivion causing eventually hyperinflation and taking all other currencies with them, they're buying up all the raw sewage bonds which will soon have negative yields, they just announced a US digital dollar which will give the feds direct control of your pocket money and will serve as a one world coin, they're buying up stocks, and people are gonna get probably permanent UBI keeping them in more control of the government. Did you not take the vaccine? Are you not behaving as the government wants you to? Well too bad, you wont get any UBI. And you will need UBI just to survive because of a hyperinflated market._ ‚ÄúEverything is depended on those who have their hands on the levers of power.‚Äù I very much respect and appreciate Mr. Dalio's insights, expertise and knowledge but I'm sooooo tired of all these wealth people pretending like they have no ability to influence public policy(YOU are ones who have your hands on the levers).  \"Philanthropist can't do this alone\" Right!.. you and all of the other wealth donors need to lobby Washington for these changes.  But is a billionaire actually going to lobby for higher taxes on themselves?.. absolutely not.  These people are so two faced, they tell you one thing on TV all while pretending like they have no responsibility or power.  Then they do another behind closed doors with their bought politicians.  And you wonder why you are vilified???  Unfortunately I believe that the revolution will most likely be violent because most of these wealth people will not do the right thing._ What if he‚Äôs wrong TWICE?_ cash is trash eh ..stfu_ 50 minutes of vague platitudes, there's really very little substance here.

Scary stuff_ My thoughts as well, ‚Äúnever let a good crisis go to waste‚Äù_ AGREED. Ray is clearly a clever and brilliant man of finance. PERIOD. While his philanthropy is good, as a former educator I think he misses the mark. Ray is a man without a body - he has no sense of Nature's time table - which has NOTHING to do with our financial markets and gives no mind to them. And she is on a tear now. Markets are as ephemeral as our dreams. They are make-believe. While the polar ice caps melt at unprecedented speeds. The man / woman I want to hear speak is an environmentalist or a farmer who takes care of the land. We should be investing in planting trees. PERIOD. We should be paying people to plant trees. PERIOD. And the pay should be GREAT and should be done in communities around the globe. As Jane Goodall makes clear - it is a third of the solution to climate change.

If he really wants to start talking about improving education you have to address the Federal and State tendencies of controlling curriculum, and you have to end tenure and make incentives for teachers. Also, it‚Äôs well known today that higher education is way overpriced and is a cesspool of liberal ideology - I would only say going to college is useful if you study engineering. Other than that I agreed with a lot of his opinions, but I still don‚Äôt trust him because of his close ties to China._ For the economic cycle. NOT the people who relied on the markets. An administration that believed in \"pulling yourself up by your own bootstraps\" was in office. Not sure if Hoover was truly in touch with the scope of the disaster that would define his presidency.

A kid sees other ‚Äúrich‚Äù kids on YouTube playing games all it wants to have is a computer to be able to do the same thing, play. the rich kid on the other end of the spectrum has a much more clear view and much more time for clear thinking as it has less to worry about and more time to see what is actually essential in a lifetime ... assuming that both kids are of equal intelligence._ It's not enough to give people fish.  You also have to teach them how to fish._ Yep, you need desire and discipline to succeed.

One can teach how to think, show not only the information, but also teach how to analize that given information, and search for more (contraditory or not) so to make the best value out of it.\n\n\nIf a kid is only handled as a consumer, and working force, you won't bring all the value it can produce into society.\n\n\nThe issue is that teaching kids how to think, will transform existing industries such as the ones stuck into the state protection and disguised under nationalistic rethoric, religious industries and media.\n\n\n And that would be a great thing for all. \n\n\nStill humans are conservative by nature, and changing the status quo is very difficult for most._ @AA-dq5uo¬† \nI grew up with nothing.

Shoes were damaged and used well beyond their normal usage. \nI seen kids with things I would have loved to have had. \nNone of that changed my life outcome.

There is no way we all can be equal, but at least we can have a possibility of it._ When you don't have a computer, it's about impossible. But when you do have one, it's about your own choice - play games or learn something, which means as a result there'll be more kids learned/educated. It isn't perfect because it's not the only way to help, but it is definitely meaningful and significant._ ‚Äã¬†@AIlovering¬† Computers are so cheap. They are not an insurmountable barrier to education. Manfred Spitzer, a renowned neuroscientist, speaks in detail about the dangers of electronic devices in the development of children's brains. Education is of unquestionable importance but the key is WHAT is being taught: Character and wisdom versus culturally marxist ideology, including feminism and so-called \"systemic racism\"? While I truly admire Ray Dalio's expertise in the economic realm, I doubt his judgement in the social/political world. He thinks of Angela Merkel as a great leader, e.g., even though she, in cahoots with other globalist decision makers, is responsible for grave very long-term damage to the social cohesion, cultural strength, and demographic composition of Germany and indirectly of other European countries._ Bitcoin James!

As long as there is money, human greed will seek to acquire it. Each generation has to deal with the problems that creates, it's differently nuanced each time, but basically the same. So unless you fix human greed the same things will keep occurring. As we cannot cure humans of the intrinsic greed inherent to all life, how about we remove money and instead reward peoples deeds with recognition and admiration through a meritocracy? The world is inextricably intertwined, the only way to administer that without risking conflict in times of stress is through a democratically elected world government. My guess is that without greed for money, such a government would naturally get populated not by those seeking to protect their own power/influence or swayed by lobbying from large corporations, but by true public servants who listen to all people equally and do what is morally right. They are out there, just look at health care workers the world over and all those going the extra mile to help someone in need. Is that a big enough paradigm shift for you Ray?¬†\n\n\nLeaving thoughts. If you don't want to abolish money, that just goes to prove my point about greed. If you don't want a world government, you must think your tribe is better than others, which risks conflict. If both those two sentiments irk you, the only solution is to get comfortable with whatever economic fall out and/or conflict ensues. Then we can start the whole process all over again and our grandchildren will have to deal with the problems that were too big for us to fix.\n\n\nNot Dave Jones_ Did he say the Chinese are helping!!!!

It will not end well. Read history haha._ Chris is yet to wake up fully_ lol \"thank China\". You can't make a statement like that without putting a HUGE asterisk.

Please clarify._ Chris didn't respect Rays point of view which is sad_ Thank you so much for the interview with Maestro Dalio!!_ Please. FFS. Can we just make things of actual value?_ Chris Lancaster Thanks for showing your side_ Yeah, right on the tip of his tongue._ Definitely.

After many decades we still don‚Äôt have an AIDS vaccine. It‚Äôs not that we don‚Äôt need one but it‚Äôs that we found a cocktail of drugs that mitigate the disease very effectively so the need for a vaccine is less. I think resources should be spent on finding drugs that mitigate covid and prevent the cases from becoming critical which is when it becomes a drain on your health care system. The solution should not be an 18 month or more away vaccine it should be finding drugs that contain this now._ Ever notice how these billionaires talk about 'reforming capitalism' after they get theirs? Odd how that works out._ Ray has previously said that the 2008 crisis was ''once in 75 year event\". 12 years on he's saying that it's happened again..._ Wow, I never realised that was canned applause in the TED intro. 0:08 Awkward._ The hosts are really not getting his main points! I cant believe their takeaway was that \"we will get through this\" and \"shouldn't you speak up re: China\" when he clearly said the world economy is ending as we know it. Perhaps he wants it that way_ Been waiting to hear him in depth. He is so diplomatic in the way he talks about what is essentially a complete economic, political, monetary breakdow!_ \"in case this monetary system breaks down, and money's redefined\"\nAnyone else is wondering, what was the other asset class, despite gold, that Ray's had on his mind but didn't finish his thought at 27:50?\nMight this be some cryptocurrency, and following that, a new monetary system based entirely on the blockchain transactions? (of course far away from the original idea of cryptocurrencies  being untraceable, as this system would be entirely controlled by governments). \nSomeone gave an example on how easy would it be for the governments to implement such a solution at the current circumstances and start a cashless society by simply introducing new crypto with designated for this gov's wallet and- to help people- give everyone some amount of coins that would be from now on, the only valid form of payment.\n...is this the NWO that Ray knows about already?_ https://youtu.be/awlckESQiKA\nIn times of crisis, this is what we need.

The notion of the best of the best isn't going to die with increasing the baseline once across time._ well you certainly benefited from capitalism and didn¬¥t divide it too well amongst the people. Now you¬¥re changing your tune pretty quickly...and let¬¥s not forget greed as a motivator!_ 49:07 for farts. hahaha great talk doe. love it_ The troubling thing is that we dont have a Roosevelt leading us in 2020.

Btw, all this stuff is on the precipice of automation.  \n\nCoronavirus is the left jab.  Automation is the overhand right cross. The economy was already crippled by debt and inequality.   This is gonna be really really bad._ Telling that Chris says ‚Äúcompanies letting go of the profit motive‚Äù and doing the good thing are mutually exclusive._ I like how Ray said to use the word\"Depression\" very carefully, as the previous depression we lack the technology to produce enough resource (such as food) for every one, but in this day and age  we have enough resources for the whole world...eg enough basic resource such as food....but how we distribute it is lethal to some.  Hence distribution of wealth._ okay so are we in deep doo doo or not?_ Very true....Even if every billionaire gave 1billion of their personal wealth to help....it is not nearly enough!  We need to re-tool our system or else no amount of money thrown at the problem will help._ Did you not understand the concept behind how models and algorithms are derived and what they rely on?_ What we are living now is still following what happened in 2008! With all the money that is being thrown at the economy, if we get out of it, remind yourself that would be postponing the inevitable and making matters worse!_ He has also repeatedly said we never recovered from 08 it was all fake growth based on debt._ Maybe he meant once every 7 to 5 years._ Yeah the hosts were just not on the same level as Ray. It was kind of cringy to watch._ It's much better than speaking over him like most loudmouth hosts do. Sometimes the best thing an interviewer can do it let their guest speak._ Tina R. There was no push back from the hosts when Ray applauded the Chinese government for supposedly helping the rest of the world during the pandemic. I lost a lot of respect for Ray when he said that. So much suffering and devastation is occurring and he couldn‚Äôt even acknowledge who was accountable for it. Almost like he‚Äôs too financially and intellectually invested in China to be objective. I bet the intellectual invested is way way more important to him, especially since he‚Äôs a billionaire who‚Äôs giving away half his wealth. What does he care at this point. Reminds me of George Soros who I admired until he went berserk. Same pattern of giving away his money and pushing causes to the extreme using whatever means to accomplish the goals._ @jamesp.couvelis2470¬† You want to blame the whole China because a virus emerged from an an illegal wild trade market. China actually handled pretty well when they learnt about the mess. How is the entire Chinese population or Government fully responsible for such a random event. They are accountable, but the same thing may happen on any place. What's more outrageous is that US being the most powerful and wealthiest cannot handle a pandemic as well than many other countries. Let's criticize your own self and improve rather than blaming._ @jamespcovelius tend to disagree with the excessive demonizing of China. Yes they tried to cover up and created a big problem for the world but the whole world was also looking on with some indifference and amusement when they were battling it at its peak._ Tina R. Agree with e&e above there. Yes the virus started in China but that was kinda of a random issue. And the COVERING UP of local gov really seems like they really didn't know what they were dealing with at that time. They took it seriously enough after realizing what was going on and the situation in China is recovering rapidly. I mean the rest of world have been criticizing on China since Jan but most of them still had no idea after two months. And don't say words like China shared wrong info because they published the gene sequence at Jan 15. It was the arrogence of authorities all around the world caused the pandemic_ @brishtiteveja¬† The CCP is accountable for breaking post-SARS agreements on transparency, hiding a highly virulent virus from the world top save their economy and face at the expense of everyone else, and are thus responsible for this entire mess. This should never be forgotten_ @tinar.9208¬† The indifferance stemmed from lack of transparency by China. You cannot know what you do not know. The world trusted that the CCP had learned its lesson after SARS. Now we know they can NEVER be trusted on the international stage. The CCP cannot be demonized enough for their conduct._ @brishtiteveja¬† Chinese state troll!!!_ JKF117 China posted the RNA data on Jan 12th, 10 days before the Wuhan lockdown. Not Jan 15th.  The RNA data was critically important because you cannot design test kit without it, and you cannot do mass testing without the test kit. And you cannot have a whole picture of how big of the pandemic without mass testing.  I had no doubt the outbreak wasn‚Äôt handling well in the very beginning in Wuhan, but it‚Äôs a new virus no one had seen before, plus the human stupidity, which lead to a point the whole city of 11million people had to shut down.  Then the whole country of 1.4 billion people shut down on Jan 23rd._ James Sproles if you can read Chinese, you‚Äôll know there was one and only one topic about the pandemic on Chinese media. And plenty of academic studies published in Science, Nature, Lancet since January. I don‚Äôt get why US kept nagging lack of information.  WHO gave the same information to every country, yet the Asian countries plus Australia and New Zealand are all in good shape, while Europe and US are in turmoil. It‚Äôs also interesting that Europe and US were ones criticize China the most from the beginning to the very end of pandemic in China.. you guys should open your mind a bit. 600,000 cases and 20,000 deaths should be indication that it wasn‚Äôt China did something wrong but you didn‚Äôt do things right._ At least she was quiet most of the time and she did not interrupt when he was speaking_ james p. Couvelis I feel the same way Ray does about the Chinese helping.  Bashing the Chinese is a cheap knee jerk reaction by many in this country.  I think much of it is born of envy for their economic progress.  We seem to think that cooperation is socialism rather than enlightenment._ @ericshang7744¬† And yet, in that time, any divergence from the CCP party line that the epidemic (not pandemic) was minor and contained in Western Media or shutting of borders to China was met with shrieks of * Racism!* from the CCP and their running dogs, because they knew that this was the weakness of the trust-based Western Societies_ ‚Äã¬†@jamesp.couvelis2470¬† You don't understand that \"Whodunit\" is beyond the point.\nWhen there is a problem, focus on solving the problem first, then learn from the experience to grow and advance the cause of humanity. This is what China and Asian countries do VERY well. They just get on with it. Meanwhile, western countries are always on the look out for someone to blame so that the bill can be footed by someone else.\n\n\nChina is forward-looking: there is a problem, here is how I can help. It seems to me that China has ALWAYS been looking for collaboration/cooperation, but it is the America of Trump that has kept firing conflicts/wars/controversies left and right to destabilise the world in an attempt to \"come first\". When people (i.e the revered \"consumers\"!) are at risk, focus on saving them first, then you can save your economy. Be harsh with yourself and with them if needed, but get it done. \n\n\nWorrying about the \"winner\" is recklessly premature, if not totally indecent in such circumstances; simply because nobody really benefits from a pandemic that grinds the global economic machine to a halt: not the wealthy, not the banks, not the governments, not the political parties and certainly not the ordinary citizens._ Honestly I see that the interviewers don‚Äôt look for a resolution. They only ask what is to come, what is next, what can rebuild the economy. They don‚Äôt ask what really brought us in this position. Nor a reasonable way to input more knowledge into those who need it. Their questions seem to be very repetitive. I would rather have them ask questions that diversify different categories of wealth in families. She/he only ask what those who have the capital to take advantage of this time, THESE people obviously know there is opportunity for success in the later future. But what about those who are clueless, how can they, in a government view, know what they should do to not end up in this position again. Yes he explains out of the context of what we can do to be in that middle class, but they need to ask questions that‚Äôll have Ray give advice to those who are in better need. Overall the better the gap is closed within the poor and rich, the better the economy will grow._ @jamesp.couvelis2470¬† ...and there I was just about to write this when I read it in the comments with your name on it. Totally agree._ @brishtiteveja¬† Not sure it's purely about COVID-19. The systematic devaluation of markets by China in order to buy out ('save') failing businesses (eg; textiles, steel, electronics) is more of the problem than COVID-19. I don't completely disagree with your comment though - democracies don't seem to have handled this crisis as well as 'less democratic' governments SAY they have..._ @James Sproles      Cambridge explain you who should accountable.     https://youtu.be/AQQf2yoymu0_ Tina R. - Bang on the money!_ @Chris Lancaster Use less Ideology and general statement in your argument will make your argument more convincing.  China just suffered the GDP contraction of 6.8%, the first such contraction since 1992.  No country is benefiting from such a disaster._ @brishtiteveja¬† I agree with you about China, but the difference is we couldn't have handled it the same way as them or we wouldn't be the United States any longer._ @jamesf78¬† China locked Wuhan down from going anywhere into china, but they didn't stop international flights, allowing the virus to spread all over the world.\nThat couldn't have been just an accident. \nThe scientists released the sequence, then China stopped it, and withdrew it from going out.\nChina has lied repeatedly about where it came from, and even lied and blamed it on italy, and then on the U.S.\nThe thing they have done will not soon be forgiven all over the world, it was just evil.\nCommunism is evil_ @jamesp.couvelis2470¬† Agree, but probably Ray sees dangers in the present blame game from Mr. T - he mentioned wars, and big power clashes of the past centuries, he doesnt want the world to fall into the Thucidydes trap again_ Marco Moschetta \nRay Dalio is way too invested intellectually and financially in China to me wrong. That‚Äôs his ego challenge._ Marco Moschetta \nThe Axios/HBO interview of the Chinese ambassador says it all._ The interviewers are a different wavelength completely missing the reality and magnitude of the situation that faces us, \nLooking at things through rose tinted glasses. The effects on the world economy will be felt for decades to come, Ray does not sugarcoat this. something akin to the Marshall plan is needed, which needs a certain amount of cohesiveness between different countries and nations at a time of least cohesiveness, globally, the order of things as we have known them for the last 70 will change dramatically._ @wombatusmaximus1788¬† First: I AM NOT DEFENDING THE ACTIONS OF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT'S HANDLING IF THE CV19 BREAKOUT.\n\nNow that we have that out of the way... Had the Chinese government better communicated, what do you think the rest of the world would have done in a few short weeks?\n\nMe? I believe VERY little would have transpired. Certainly here in the US. Trump touted CV as a glorified flu. It wasn't until the WHO declared it as a worldwide pandemic that Trump displayed any semblance of good leadership._ @brishtiteveja¬† How do you know for sure that the virus emerged from China? With billions of people on this Earth don't you think it's next impossible to pin point to China that quick? What if it's just a blame game?_ @jamesp.couvelis2470¬† you are the typical type that Rays mentioned about on this conversation. \"Even say thank you China is a political challenging\". Brainwashed by your local media_ @Chris Lancaster I wonder how old are you to say something so naive and so irresponsible? Nothing you said were based on evidences but a bunch of nonsence trash that your local media told you about._ @wombatusmaximus1788¬† DUDE... you don't even know the difference between epidemic and pandemic...sad...go check your dictionary_ @lynlee6861¬† why does USA not shut down the fly do to the flu season?_ Right. Read between the lines. Life as we knew it is gone forever. We are entering a new age, business cycles repeat and Covid just speed it all up . People will suffer and people will thrive. Welcome to the new world_ @jamesf78¬† well stated!_ @LuisRodriguez-zy8mv¬† hey if you watched Tom Bilyue's interview he was trying to go that route. Tbh Ray is almost stating the same thing which to me comes off like a pre rehearsed speech. Of course his wisdom is valuable but I feel he's kinda passing the buck. Or rather tap dancing around it._ Tina R. Which wont happen - he ist very smart at the same time very pessimistic_ @gizmoffm¬† It will happen.... Eventually. Maybe not this cycle._ Because it's impossible that it will be an anarchical collapse like Mad Max or The Road or other apocalyptic movie fantasies. That's absurd. It might happen in a runaway global warming scenario or a nuclear war (and a nuclear winter - just a nuclear war won't do it), but not in a society with beyond massive infrastructure and food production and a social safety net and financial mechanisms that were put in place after the Great Depression and WW2.\n\nTHE most devastated country in the world after WW2, the USSR, didn't have a house standing for 1,000 km in any direction in 1945. In 1961 they put a man in space. It's very, very hard to take human societies down._ valar    Excellent post! Thanks for injecting some reality into the endless doomsday fantasies. The undeveloped world is in serious trouble, yes, but even they can work their way out of it. \n\nWhen everyone wants something, as a collective, it can only happen if they have an ounce of control over it._ @squamish4244¬† At 1% death it's not a structural collapse scenario... what happens if the next one has a 25% death rate though? What happens if it happens now? What is the Mad Max magic number?_ Thank you. People have an emotional attachment to doomsday scenarios - more than a few get off on them. It's the relief of a 'hard restart' to society, just shutting off all the sound and fury. \n\nMost of the sound and fury is the endless chatter in our own minds, but many people confuse the external world with their own mental states. This is my Buddhist perspective talking here.\n\nYes, this will be very hard on Sub-Saharan Africa and other poor societies. But we will be in a position to help them by the time the pandemic really hits Africa hard, I hope.\n\nAnd part of Sub-Saharan Africa already survived a huge catastrophe, basically a world war, in the late 90s-early 2000s that killed 5-10 million people - the bloodiest war since WW2._ Yes, we got very lucky this time that the death rate is so low. But we will be far better prepared next time, as we are learning a tremendous amount now. And Trump will be dead or playing bingo in a senior's centre by then. \n\nAlso, the scientists I've heard say that mutations that make pandemics worse are very rare - usually they do nothing or even weaken the virus. It was so bad in 1918 because the people with the worst infections were all put in field hospitals while the others stayed at the front, concentrating the nastiest strains of the virus for when all the men came home.\n\nA 25% death rate is still not enough for structural collapse. The Black Death had a 30-40% death rate and society didn't fall apart. The Black Death caused massive social and economic changes in Europe, if that's what you mean. And this one will do the same.\n\nYou would need a ~70-90% death rate to cause full-on structural collapse. The reason I chose that number is because that's what took down many Native American societies hit by smallpox and about a dozen other horrible diseases. The Mississippi Valley urban civilization vanished, leaving the mounds that we know today. \n\nFrom historical examples, you generally need multiple massive failures to cause structural collapse. The Maya suffered from drought, overpopulation, environmental degradation, inflexible leadership and war. So basically everything that could go wrong did go wrong. Even then some city-states survived.\n\nI'm not arguing that the structural collapse of modern civilization is not possible. I'm very worried about runaway global warming, for instance, and we need to get on that as soon as this pandemic ends. I'm just saying that it would take a huge catastrophe or a series of catastrophes to do it. There are eight billion of us - kill half of us and there are still four billion left. Kill 3/4 and there are still two billion left. So..._ @valar I can see your point, yes the consolidated might of the US is high. But it also sounds a bit like the opposite of doomsday-ing, which is trying to take comfort in the past. There's big cracks developing in monetary policy as we know it. The Fed has never done what it's done this time. And the world hasn't simultaneously shut down like this ever. Theres no way this economic shock leaves the dollar system unscathed._ He's big part of the reason we're in this mess....Helped sell out the USA_ @STELLASCUTENESS¬† Undeveloped world??_ A systemic collapse and a new world order will definitely come, you can't print to eternity, according to history, countries and currencies don't last forever, there is a limit to how much you can print before causing a systemic breakdown. Over 99.9% of all currencies have eventually become collector's items. When the dollar starts breaking from the deficit spending, quantitative easings, negative interest rates, and it ultimately collapses under its own weight, the ripples of this destruction will be global, unlike more contained systemic breakdowns like what is happening in Venezuela right now, or what has happened in other countries with highly devalued currencies. Right now Venezuela is living in a post-government anarchy for the most part, there aren't guards or policemen around public spaces, gas stations no longer charge for gas, they are just there for anyone to take, there is a surge in crime and theft, and the police that still work are doing so minimally, just in the last week 4 people stealing food were killed by policemen, its situation is worse now due to coronavirus, on top of the economic restrictions the US and others imposed on them, alongside their failed currency, failed government, a cheap oil market, and a weak economy lacking on diversified exports besides oil. A metric I like to use when comparing poverty is how much prostitution there is and how much prostitutes charge, prostitution has grown in Venezuela and the average rates are $10 - $20. Venezuela is now trading in dollars, bitcoin, currencies of nearby countries, cigarettes and their own currency, still. I'm not from Venezuela, but I happen to have been born in a country whose government destroyed its currency TWICE during my parents adulthood, terrorists almost took power and they bombed civilian structures frequently (cinemas, parks, etc. My dad almost died from going to a theater). Our government became a dictatorship led by one man, no congress, his administration killed a lot of terrorists and civilians to end the threat of terrorists taking power over the country, they won, but the economy collapsed for many years before recovery. I don't think the fake currency system that the central banks have going worldwide, and the broke governments swimming in debt, including the US, will survive another 2-3 crises like this one unless the average person is beyond stupid. This crisis is man-made, just like all crises in modern history. Economic wars don't happen \"naturally\", humans have been fighting for resources for 98-99% of recorded history. Natural disasters do happen, but corona isn't causing this global depression,government restrictions and the coming devaluations are, corona alone could kill up to 500,000 people worldwide before herd immunity is achieved, 500k is less than what 1 bad influenza season means in terms of deaths, it is not enough to cause a global depression. I think more severe crises, like a global nuclear war could accelerate the death of broken governments and existing fiat currencies, which can happen, even soon... due to Trump's nationalist ideas and a retraction from globalism (huge mistake) a nuclear WW3 can very well happen. Humanity and progress will survive of course, but changed, possibly under a new world order. Again, there is simply a limit to how much you can print.. What I'm learning from this is that institutions that are insolvent or with negative balance sheets shouldn't be allowed to exist, if they do, it means the economy has become distorted, monstrous, unnatural. Now that the government is buying corporate debt directly, bailing out businesses, and the FED considering negative interest rates, this is probably the end of free-capitalism, if it ever existed, and the beginning of something similar to what china has, a government controlled and a government-owned capitalism.

The word fight immediately brings out the swords and we search our personal armory for bigger weapons. It is going to take courage and in some cases an arbitrary coin flip, under which conditions by both parties will follow that agreement to take a concerted action. This has been an ancient Chinese method, and has been handed down throughout time as the arbitrator. [See coin toss at basketball and football arenas.] Are we willing to let our conditions go, if after a vigorous debate of the issues at hand an impasse exists? I, personally have learned the value of this proposition through several contracts on wildfires which were in excess of 100k acres, and containment was at hand. Yet their were dire results if you moved forward or you retreated. Choices were made quickly and decisively, as fire changes the underlying conditions instantaneously. So a coordinated effort in the single direction which had been arbitrarily determined was made a reality. Land, watersheds, building and lives were all at stake. We can do this restructuring well, or we can fight, throw punches, or drag our heels and impact the outcome with our angst. It is a daily choice.

The business called gambling is frowned upon by the gambling called business._ Why do you feel like gambling should be illegal anyway?_ @Chris Lancaster The money comes from more innovation, which increases the total size of the pie.  Over the years, the pie will exponentially grow as innovation generates more and more wealth.  Therefore, one man getting richer is not always dependent on making others poorer, but on generating wealth through ingenuity.  For example, the invention of the computer made a few people very rich on their invention, but also allowed for new markets to open making the masses wealthier (in money/knowledge/collective well being etc.)_ @jakebierman6122¬† Why do you feel that the growth will be exponential?\nAnd more importantly, you seem to imply that growth never ends. If that is what you meant, can you explain why you feel that that is the case?_ @TomyLobo¬† Technology is advancing at an exponential rate and economic growth tends to grow along with technology.  I do not expect economic growth to end for the foreseeable future, although with finite resources, exponential growth cannot last forever.  But for the time being, we are going to see massive economic growth in the upcoming decade as better technology is available cheaper than it has ever been and close to half a billion people coming out of poverty and joining the consumer class will stimulate even more growth._ ‚Äã¬†@jakebierman6122¬† What technology is advancing at an exponential rate?\n\nIC density used to double every 18 months, but that, by some measures, is either breaking down or has already broken down.\nMany resource extraction metrics have reached their peak long ago, some have reached it more recently. Either way, those resource extraction industries are now shrinking, not growing.\nWhat you don't see is that the issue is on the supply end, not the demand end._ ‚Äã¬†@TomyLobo¬† I totally agree that much of the tech we have now has seemed to peak.  I am trying the look at the bigger picture further in the future when I talk about exponential technological innovation. In the same way that the internet was a major breakthrough in tech that changed everything seemingly out of nowhere, we don't know what Earth-shattering tech is around the corner, waiting to generate massive wealth around the world in ways we didn't see possible before. Tech is growing exponentially in that every major advancement takes a greater leap forward from the previous.  The leap from the pen-and-paper days to what have now with the whole world connected via the internet is a massive leap forward, but we can expect the jump from internet to whatever succeeds it to be even greater._ @Chris Lancaster I do not, please elaborate_ @jakebierman6122¬† That is an assumption you are making and the internet and pen and paper are really not that great to compare and extrapolate anyway.\nLike i said, resource extraction is shrinking and once you realize that all the rich countries, having exhausted their own decades ago, get their resources from poorer countries, you start to see how those poorer countries cannot ever hope to achieve this same level of wealth. There is simply no poorer country left to exploit at some point.\nAt this point, if not sooner, the global economy will start to shrink as a whole._ ZodyZody  You are putting your money behind companies that are already largely winning._ @wilfriedvomacka1783¬† or bankrolls, see blockbuster, see wework, its gambeling, you can choose your level of time to gamble. why moving \"money\" from hand to hand is generating so much for the stock?_ The biggest problem is that many people no longer believe in globalization. This is not a knee-jerk reaction to this pandemic and the economic fallout that is coming, this has been brewing in the western world for more than a decade. The oncoming recession, possibly depression, is just throwing more gasoline onto the burning fire. Basically the laissez faire capitalist free market system does not exist any longer. We live in an age where too many companies are \"too big to fail\" and the economic consequences are pushed on to the future generation to pay the bill. Mr. Dalio's comments on education would have possibly been germane 30 - 40 years ago but I have my doubts about their relevancy today. Most higher educational institutions are preaching/teaching good old fashion socialist doctrine to their student bodies, not the benefits of a capitalist free market system. A lot of Mr. Dalio's opinions sound themselves moldy and antiquated, he's sketching his philosophy to rebuild a global economic system using cyclical historical case studies of past economic implosions as an evidentialary blueprint for future reconstruction purposes.The biggest problem is that many nations intend to save their cash cows at all cost, many airlines, energy, transport and health providers will certainly be nationalized in Europe. When governments¬†step it to 'save' organizations then we are no longer speaking of a free market¬†system. Italy, Spain and Portugal are¬†all now threatening to let the EU collapse if the \"rich\" northern EU members do not initiate an immediate wealth redistribution¬†program (thus redistributing¬†national¬†debt from the south to the north via the introduction of Eurobonds) to help them pay their accumulated¬†national debt that transpired before the pandemic had begun.When the \"rich' northern countries complain about their (decades long) failing monetary governance¬†in these countries (where 150 percent GDP debt is normal) they complain about the lack of empathy when senior citizens are dying of the Covid-19 virus.

I suppose they felt that borrowing was fine. As money was cheaper in the future thanks to inflation and rising incomes. What happens when many people loose their jobs all at once? People realise money isnt as abundant in this version of the future as they thought. The cows come home so to speak. So there is a reckoning. Those that havent been living beyond their means will be the winners as theyll still have leverage to borrow and invest even with a depleted income._ from the wealth of nations we can take a passage where Smith said that the market, although imperfect, is the best way to get the approximate universal value of the working force that is intrinsic to every product. I read this book for the first time 17 years ago, and ever since, i have been revising its merits and flaws. In that sentence about the market being the state of the art mechanism to proper value the laboring force value, that is a hint about the pathos that we are everlong suffering since we've entered the \"free\" market era. That imperfection, that he metions, emerges from 2 elements. Every agent depends on instrumentality and information. So the work universal value can be tampered due to opaque and unbalanced information flow and due to the power that some agents and instituitions acquire and start blocking the fully developing of an independent agent. The idea was that each one could bring the product of its labor into the market and have its work being trade by the work of others, but what when a great portion of your productivity is not yours by the very legal bidings that could protect you, ina  system shaped by the former winners that do not benefit from a fully atomical society. We are very close to a point where the tooling will be enough to either orchestrate and equalize sufficient info for holistic market planning and to disconnect human activities from material productivity turning every man fully autonomous and political. Or the final concetration where the info will be totally concentrated in the hands of even fewer and no longer needing to buy much of the laboring due to advances in automation.

Ever since humans started to dominate life on earth about 200,000 years ago, they too had to compete for survival. There has also been a tendency for humans to compete in trying to conquer, dominate and control other humans and get other humans to be servants and slaves. Humans have also created caste and class systems and have an amazing talent to tell fascinating stories that have also been used to dominate and control other humans.  For most humans, life has always been a struggle and a competition for survival.\r\n\n\nI think trying to develop an economic system that everyone can earn a fair living such that wealth can be fairly distributed is a requirement for the goal of peace and cooperation to be achieved in the world.

If there is any chance for humans to live on earth in peace without abusing or killing each other and destroying earth‚Äôs environment in the process, so far, democracy, science, reason, rationality, logic, and critical thinking are the best systems that have been developed to try and achieve this goal. \r\n\n\nTrying to earn a living is always a challenge and I am hoping that the explosion of information technologies like the internet can help and inspire all of earth‚Äôs citizens live together in better ways._ –ù–∞ —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–º –±—ã –∏–ª–∏ —Ö–æ—Ç—è –±—ã —Å—É–±—Ç–∏—Ç—Ä—ã (_ I heard him pretty clearly when he said we were in a Depression._ He had a good reason to do that.

Interestingly enough, it seems everybody honestly believes his  own  ideas about the rightness or  wrongness of things are correct, and almost everybody is acquainted with people who hold completely opposite views  - so  the  ideas  of  some  (or all) must be  incorrect. How do you know whether or not you are one of those holding erroneous beliefs? There is a test: Before you can be reasonably convinced that you are right about a particular idea you should be sure that you understand the  objections and the positions of your most articulate antagonists. You must find out whether your views are supported by a sound knowledge of opposing ideas, or by your misconceptions of opposing ideas.

Is that what you‚Äôre saying? Are you also saying that‚Äôs what Bush meant , Clinton and. So on ?_ @williamvyner6175¬† LIKE I SAID LOOK IN THE MIRROR_ ‚Äã¬†@youtuber6185¬†ask yourself, what did they mean when they uttered NWO what kind of new system? Study their history  before and during their presidency. Read The Constitution of the United States of America to find out what kind of NWO the founders of the country set up for posterity [ us ]. The difference will stand out like a sore thumb.\n\n\nHere is some wisdom from Benjamin Franklin.\n\"Only a virtuous people are capable of freedom. As nations become corrupt and vicious, they have more need of masters.\"_ William Vyner one theory is that societies and the world  are moving toward a new direction, one where there is a one world government... kind of like in Star Trek eventually where we all work towards the same goal as one. It‚Äôd my understanding that change can happen over time however money is made during booms and busts. So some try to steer or at least profit from manipulation. \n\nGeorge Soros has influenced countries and made his fortune from currency trading. He stopped trading and invested into the Open Society Foundation. His stated goal, much like other globalists is to steer society to be open and to normalize the masses , but to maintain themselves as more elite. This is much less of a conspiracy and more of just something you can simply watch happening. \n\nAlso it used to be a conspiracy that the top elite of the world met until we found out that they do through many clubs, one example is Bildaberg which is shut out from the press in the US , China, North Korea, Russia and a few other controlled info states but much of the World widely reports it. I first heard of it in Germany. They laughed at me and said Americans don‚Äôt know what goes on it the world.\n\nI think that globalism is something that IS and Will happen and we are headed towards a Nee World Order. And it would seem to me that there are good and bad people who have different motives on HOW it will be ordered._ ToniArt Blue  President HW Bush mentioned the NWO and as the former director of the CIA they took action on moving to mold thy world towards an American dominated order. I‚Äôm sure a Putin has different plans on how he sees the world ordered as does Germany or China. But there are some who have a ONE view of the New World Order that may counter what any one countries or people‚Äôs goals are. Ask yourself if there are any people who have gained from the events in the world they helped shape._ @youtuber6185¬†i agree and yes i understand all of that, and I know its not a conspiracy, thats why i told that other Guy william vyner, to look in the mirror because it is the governed who give our consent to the government officials. we are a reflection of it period, people who by default dismiss NWO being related to a \"cabal\" are the ones who believe its a conspiracy based on the fact that they turn what is clear to see into a conspiracy by a cabal  thus turning it into myth. read the first couple of comments made at the top of this thread. one world government is here and it was setup in 1945 and declared in 1942. we are in the middle of its maturation. no one is good but God and humans are just trying their best to do whats right._ Yes their are many who have gained from the events in the world they helped shaped. What you consider a gain, im not sure, some people believe going into debt to have nice things is a gain so they support policy that aims for that. some people think murdering is a gain so they support policy that aims for that. What the one world government look likes right now ,to me, is socialistic and completely adverse to a republic based on freedom.\n\n\nI stood in class everyday in the morning and recited \"i pledge allegiance to this flag of the untied states of america and to the REPUBLIC for which it stands, one nation under God indivisible with LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL.\n\n\nthey should have just told us to recite\n\" i plegde allegiance to this flag of the united nations of the world and to the DEMOCRACY for which it stands, One world under no God divisible with PROTECTION AND ORDER FOR ALL._ ToniArt Blue Guys like Soros literally crashed economies.... then made billion a off currency trades.

A handful of them could lift 50percent out of poverty, by affording them an education,  and just some basic needs if they were serious. \nNo their socialist,  they want to take other people's money and give out pittances, and then pat themselves on the back, and feel virtuous.\nThey're hypocrites plain and simple_ I‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôve never met a computer that could think.

It's just about organizing the numbers (money) to make people happy._ Ted ZoomTalks_ China is taking advantage of this situation to undermine the US also making money on selling test kits and medical supplies._ Globalism > Nationalism/Protectionism. Globalism aims to convert developed countries‚Äô economy to service based, more smart jobs while outsourcing industry jobs like manufacturing aka dumb jobs to developing countries like China. It‚Äôs just that simple. Why would anyone be against a service based economy and insist on maintaining manufacturing jobs? The job loss from manufacturing can be easily replaced by getting more people educated to work in service rather than being a labour working in a factory. Globalism = lower operating costs for corporations due to lower wage in developing countries = Stock market goes up Nationalism = Higher operating costs for corporations due to higher wages in developed countries = Stock market goes up slowly. Compare Obama/Clinton‚Äôs stock market growth versus Trump. Stock market reflects on American businesses and under the globalists, stock market are higher due to an efficient economy. Nothing wrong with Ray Dalio being a globalist. He‚Äôs a visionary person unlike the American nationalists._ Add social capital to every financial statement used in transactions and contracts for buying, borrowing and selling. One Monarch in an African Country created a happiness \"column\" to assessing the national GDP.  We could redefine a successful company like Tesla and Amazon by subtle changes in mission statements. Amazon might have a higher profit margin than Tesla. Now add a happy employee column to their asset spreadsheet and Tesla looks like the healthier,  more valuable and sustainable business model for a newer world order._ Somebody should inform Ray Dalio that Congress passed a $2 trillion spending bill to celebrate the virus. He should read the newspapers and form an opinion about important current events, it would make him a better voter and pundit._ 33:15 \"The Chinese are helping, to even say that is a Politically loaded statement, it's almost dangerous\"\n34:00 \"Totally true, I think all of us are gonna say thank you to... (oh damn, I'll get death threats from Internet Trolls...) ... um... the different people who are helping\"_ Chris Anderson of TED always asks speakers very critical questions. Really good!_ This is great wisdom from someone who wish good to everyone. However, I don't trust people behave rationally, and their populist leaders take the best decision. The overheard tone is of divisiveness, retaliation, distrust, and disinformation. In this globalised world leaders are behaving like tribal chieftains and warlords of militias.

But if china told about this pandemic earlier, half of the world must have been saved._ I like how at 46:50 Chris laughs and there's like a 2-second delay until Corey laughs. Either she got bored and just tried to make it look like she's still following along once she notived him laugh or she didn't get the joke and just wanted to look smart._ var1328 What‚Äôs wrong with globalism though? There are not many good arguments against globalism economically besides it creates job losses in industry, but why would a developed country like the US still need an industry based economy? Shouldn‚Äôt we move onto service and more skilled/intelligence based work and let the developing countries do the dumb jobs for us?_ var1328 I don‚Äôt agree with open borders, I believe in legal immigration. So I‚Äôm all for deportation of illegal immigrants. I‚Äôm not a left wing person. However, economically, globalism is the most efficient. Would you rather pay a thousand bucks for an iPhone 11 made in China or two-three thousand bucks made in the USA. The law of demand states as price increases, the demand falls and vice versa. Most people in this country simply don‚Äôt make enough money to afford a two-three thousand dollar iPhone. So globalism makes things affordable in the US at the expense of losing manufacturing jobs, but again. I think the US should incentivize education to make people work in skilled service jobs not in a factory._ that's the word from a wise man. now think of Trump lol_ @oshio9129¬† Hi troll_ Oshio when you condemn someone being guilty, shouldn‚Äôt you be the one prove it first? It‚Äôs dangerous to take media nowadays for granted_ @oshio9129¬† 1\\ Both the doctor and the government didn't know anything about the virus at the very beginning(the doctor is majoring in OphthalmicÔºånot communicable); 2\\ It was a mistake that local authority warns the doctor due to consideration that such spread would bring more panic socially and had been recognised and corrected by Central government soon; 3\\ Chinese Central Government acts rapidly and corrected response faster than you can imagine to address the virus. Just imagine if the same virus first happen in US under Trump's administration. I am not saying China didn't make any mistake at the very beginning, while I dno't think any country facing a new kind of such virus would make no mistake.See what US did even after it knows what the virus is and how bad it is. But What China as such a populous country did later is far more impressive and effective. And I am not asking you to be grateful about China's response but would be really decent to appreciate what others contribute and sacrifice._ ‚Äã¬†@oshio9129¬† Besides that. Do you know the mechanics of supply and demand? If there are LOW supply and a HUGE demand, obviously prices go up. And if china wouldn't produce any face masks, will the USA do? There are lots of idiots still blaming China for all of this, but does this help? Why wasting all that energy and thoughts on this nonsense, but rather fking DO something. You know what's even funnier? https://www.forexfactory.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=3595189&d=1585759881 and google which country is 1st Place of most confirmed COVID-19 cases._ @oshio9129¬† Your so called source \"news\" are from the same organizations that bash China for years. Do you even wonder why you are so negative towards China and even sometimes glad in your heart that every tiny negative \"story\" that comes out of the western media makes you confirm that China is the evil boogeyman. Your mentality shows brainwash at its finest, a false sense of ‚Äúfree media\"._ @oshio9129¬† Chinese factories are producing those essential goods because they were doing this for YEARS  and some factories have switched to produce, for example, face masks because they CAN. Obviously,  most US \"factories\" got outsourced and those few left, just don't have the \"ability\" to cope the huge demand. So you want China just to stop selling and producing face masks? Lmao. You are weird. Trump is now blaming the WHO and wants to cut fundings. Kinda stupid right now, right?_ ‚Äã¬†@oshio9129¬† And please wake up kid and get back to reality. Humanitarian reasons? Just look at the United States. There were trillions of dollars injected by the FED into the economy and just a few billions were actually for THOSE who need that money. The average American just gets 1.200$  and that is a joke. There are so many individuals living paycheck to paycheck. Lots of debts and due to the Pandemic, many lost their jobs. More than 14 million citizens are now unemployed. In addition, most of them don't have much savings to survive any longer. And all they get are 1.200$ each. While big cooperations get billions of dollars and bailouts there and here. Companies that don't deserve those bailouts. So wake up and educate yourself. I don't need sources. You can google them, cuz these news are hot hot hot._ @oshio9129¬† You see the double standards? \"Terrorists groups\" against the US are met with war and bombs in their villages or kept in Guantanamo Bay without Trial. Groups that kill Chinese are \"freedom fighters\". You want to criticize the CCP be my guest, I am no fan of the ccp myself but I will not get my source from any Cult Falungong or terrorist groups(both funded by the CIA)_ Don't tell me the world didn't know anything about the virus in January. They also criticized China Wuhan lockdown to be too strict and against human rights. The whole western press was looking with amusement on the sidelines when China was battling it at its peak in January and February._ @malex1939¬†  \"the world.. criticized the wuhan lockdown to be too strict\"???  Links please._ @JonathanBer¬† \"Trump is now blaming the WHO and wants to cut fundings.\"  Yeah.  WHO is garbage.  Did absolutely nothing._ @funbigly¬† While the biggest member and contributor country to the WHO is US, how ironically that US can't influence more than China in this organization if what Trump blame is true. BTW, at this key point, halting the fund to WHO really helps Mr Trump to grabble with the virus issue domestically?_ ‚Äã¬†@oshio9129¬† A tip: BBC in China is considered as FAKE NEWS. And if you have ever studied in college you should understand the reliability of first hand sources and second hand sources, what you proved are all based on second hand sources(which means it could be highly dramatized from the original event),  and even more, you tried to use second hand sources as your prior way to obtain information instead checking out the researches that published by scientist. Conclusion, Anti-intellectualism\r is occupying your mind._ Lol reading all these comments are making me sick. Ray has gotten a point about people having challenges saying thank you to China and you guys are proving him right right here on the spot_ @joeandrew1300¬† China was the first to face the challenge. Thanks for your rational criticism._ wow people complaining about only getting $1200? vast majority in China gets nothing, and they're asked(required) to donate._ Joe Andrew have you even looked into this? I know he sounds crazy but he‚Äôs right... the Chinese government lied and lied again. It‚Äôs not really a debate._ @oshio9129¬† You have done a fine job informing yourself here, I am sorry you were so roundly attacked. This information should be well known by everyone a month ago. German secret service says China was aware, covered it up and it has cost the world greatly. A month later we are learning the Wuhan lab was most likely the source of the virus and has worked hard to cover it up. \n\n\nThere world is waking up to how China is not a good neighbor, I think it is important that message gets out. However Ray's point was that we can't just leave it there. We need to also understand how to work with our problematic neighbor because he's not going to move. I believe he also mention we will be decoupling from them. A month on this has already begun, Airpods to be built in Vietnam._ Yeah, that was a great side turn from the interviewer haha_ @joeandrew1300¬†??????????If China and WHO didn't lie how western societies will act so slow. I need to tell you, there is no way to appreciate China. If you really appreciate what China did, you are a murder for Chinese citizens. How many people died due to Chinese center government? Because you don't know the facts, so you assume it did well. I'm chinese, but I need to tell you China didn't do it better compared with USA. 1) Chinese didn't reveal the true information. There are so many evidences showing that more people get infected from virus. It's even 10 times more than the data which shows by Chinese regime. 2) WHO did not take its responsibility. WHO ease all countries who are worried about this virus, you can see it from the early report which WHO mentioned the virus is like flue based on the data from China. 3) Chinese cut its own domestic flights, however chinese government press WHO to allow other countries still maintain the flights with China.  4) if you really pay attention to this virus. You can find the counties getting most cases, which are the most closest to China. The relationship between Iran and China is pretty close. There are so many chinese from South china who are living in the north of Italy due to business reasons._ I expected the debates after your comment. In some ways, the media and Trump are so successful to mess things up and worse. It's already beyond Politically right._ Ray ray is the man but ‚Äúthanking China‚Äù for a crisis they created is a bridge too far....  A BRIDGE too far!_ I love how everybody is suddenly a financial advisor and tell everyone to buy gold because print money = inflation. We are more at risk for a deflation in Europe for example, even as they are printing, so buying gold would lose a lot of money. But above all, even if we get a 3% inflation per annum for the next 10 years, you'd have plenty of time to select stocks and assets with good visibility in the next couple years. So the only advice here is, don't panic, be patient, and make informed decisions not based on youtube vid√©os or even worse, comments. Diversify and hedge._ The market is going up with cheap money,  not profits.

The men seems to say the right things \"We need to make education available for all\"...... But what do his actions say?

Austerity will lead to a depression._ Such a great mind! thank you!_ As a financial analyst, I can tell any economist is that it is neither capitalism or socialism that have failed. It has been people that have failed both systems and twisted both systems to be profitable to people of power. Human greed and the hunger for power is the human downfall. As the saying goes, \"we have seen the enemy and it is us,\"_ capitalism can be fixed once you remove the central banks out of the equation. simple as that._ I'm happy to thank China for help they've given with the virus, as long as they're happy to also accept blame for their initial mishandling of it that let it spread and cause millions to suffer.

Do you think there should be an organization, locally and/or worldly, that will inspect such places to keep sanitary high and a low chance of breeding highly infectious diseases? -- Maybe it will be controlled and monitored at a, and by local area Inspectors first and further up as far as the country, and even further up, a world organization that keeps track of such places and/or violations? And if they fail, hold accountable, maybe, perhaps even the Country or Nation itself. And that means any Country or Nation held accountable next time. Of course, always within reason. I think this time is a great opportunity to learn from, but maybe for the next time. Because honestly, I think we dodged a bullet this time round. The next time can be far more worse. People don't know how close or how easy it is to break a system by overwhelming essential services like hospitals, 911 Services and grocery stores, Etc. That is just only one aspect of it, for there are many. For instance, when people start to panic and they no longer want to go to work, which is understandable. However, and this is very important, essential services start to break down from there and this will determine who will live and who will die, and personal right will be taken away for good. I mean, we have experienced some form of this already. And if things got really bad it could even lead to a war. So yes, I'm just alittle bit worried about the next time.

If the employee/manager ratio is 5/1, then a very conservative estimate is that 20% of the global workforce is responsible in some way for inventing something, improving something, finding a better way to get something to work, etc. 800 million people show up at work every morning to make some kind of improvement, innovation, or breakthrough.\r\n\r\nIn the real world, these produce all kinds of savings or market penetrations (sales or customer loyalty formation). Sometimes these make it into stock prices, but a lot of times these innovations only produce an easier life for the innovator. This is particularly true for farmers, small business owners, government bureaucrats, etc. Rather than improving stock prices, these improve conditions for taxpayers.\r\n\r\nA lot of these improvements are duplications, and these duplications may have occurred over and over, in various parts of the world, over thousands of years. Some others have only occurred once, and are only now filtering out into the larger economy._ This guy talks little, but doesn't give specifics.

(There WILL be others during the next decade.)\n\nThere will be wars, both regional and a nuclear one.\n\nWe are presently in a Grand Solar Minimum, during which time the extreme weather events that we‚Äôve been seeing will greatly intensify, and earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and floods, droughts, and wildfires will increase.\n\nA large portion of the Northern Hemisphere will shortly become uninhabitable, along with parts of the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nWithin 24 months we will experience a global famine (the beginnings of which we‚Äôre seeing now) and complete societal breakdown.\n\nIt won‚Äôt be fun.\n\nEven during the last Grand Solar Minimum (The Maunder Minimum), fully 25% of the then global population perished due to starvation, plague, and freezing primarily, and this happens every 400 years.\n\nTHIS time will be different.

I also believe that there is no true freedom except in Christ.\n\nThe Love of God and hope in Christ is ultimately the only preparation worth making, and it is the focus of my life.\n\nUntil the last day of ‚ÄòThe Last Days‚Äô dawns, however, we each must care for and protect our families from the evils of this world.\n\nWe must provide them with food, shelter, and an excellent education that includes comprehensive survival skills.  \nWe homeschooled our children and have done that.  They all know how to survive for as long as God is willing to spare them, as do my husband and I.\n\nEveryone has their line in the sand, however, and I will abide by the laws of this system, however absurd, until that line is crossed.  If the current trend continues, and I can see no reason why it won‚Äôt, then people like me have very little time left - unless Jesus returns first.\n\nSo, how prepared am I?  Spiritually, only God can judge that but I sure hope I‚Äôm prepared enough.\n\nFrom an Earthly standpoint, I can survive without the need for money, digital or otherwise, as I know how to live in harmony with nature, which always supplies our every need.\n\nI wouldn‚Äôt bother with gold and silver etc, if I were you.  Even if the .govs of the world allowed you to keep it (they won‚Äôt), there won‚Äôt be any food left to buy shortly.\n\nIt‚Äôs a good idea to learn to grow your own food both outdoors and indoors, although I wouldn‚Äôt count on that not being confiscated too.

Ray Dalio obviously knows what he is talking about but I found some of what he said condescending, whether it was about the CEO/soldier analogie or the diversification need. Moreover, the comment about diversification makes him seem a little bit out of touch. But for me, the worst part is the perpetuation of the \"allocation of resources\" myth. That successful capitalists are somewhat better suited to make this decision, hence the importance of philanthropy.

Anyway there was unconfirmed news last year for his fund to bet on March market down with $1B short._ @dr.magnanimous8973¬† You are absolutely right, when I heard the news last year for his March short hedge, I started to empty my stock and turned to treasure bonds and option put (but keep partial call as hedge) , but no one could predict conoravirus as a pin (Peter Schiff's words) to burst the bubble._ What scares me most is that the world is repeating cronyism capitalism as did on 2008 bailout through FED, Mnuchin and Blackrock etc. Once revealed years later, next round of occupy wall street movement may be a violence protest, leading to unimaginable situation as warned by Ray Dalio_ @larryzheng6117¬† Is it still a good time to sell shares now and cut losses, even though there has been a crash already (as in is the market likely to get much worse)?_ @javedalam5549¬† Depending on whether you believe the global recession is doomed or not,  plus the forecoming Mnuchin's bailout will save the whole market or his political cronies_ @larryzheng6117¬† What are your thoughts on those two things?_ @javedalam5549¬† I am not at the level as high as Ray Dalio, so I trust his insight and discretion. He is not optimistic, neither am I_ How could you? it said nothing of pandemics ..._ @Kungpuk¬† Pandemic is needless to mention and nothing to worry, it is just a matter of time e.g. one year, to achieve effective medicine, vaccine, herd immunity or coronavirus mutation to flu motality. One century ago, the Spanish Flu killed tens of millions of people, it just affirms Darwin's evolution - the survival of the fittest. Now with modern medicine and microbiology, mankind has more options to tackle the natural disaster, but we should prevent man-made disaster and this is what Dalio is alerting to us_ Free markets will eventually prevail.  ‚ÄúI am a capitalist‚Äù, says Ray.

Now that is what you need to say NO I wont BUY it, just buy strenght from producer. We can do it. We dont need to drive BMWs wear gucci levis or even H&M we need to take care of eachother spend time with loved ones, get away from being just a robot working to earn and spend and repeat cycle. We need to be surprised every morning by the sounds of nature, animals birds trees skyline moon and the sun. We need to produce our food as much as we can. We need to have communes, we need not to capitalise on profits bit share work and food and live freely less and more humane. I will and we all can!_ I mean it‚Äôs obvious that thanking China is controversial given that they didn‚Äôt care about the world at all when the virus unleashed (the outgoing flights were not canceled). To top it all off many countries which donated supplies to China (like Italy) are now forced to buy them back and are thanking them at the same time which is just ridiculous. Chinese government is a cancer of our world. https://youtu.be/KQaNdTKQyLY_ \"Debts that cannot be repaid, will not be repaid\" quote by Chicago School Economist Michael Hudson. \nBankruptcy destroys Money not Property.

Easiest job in the world._ ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt mean just give money away‚Äù great answer!_ Who is this Marco guy they keep mentioning? Would like to search up_ Ray Dalio, you and people like you have profited off of and exploited a broken system for long enough. We need to end fiat money, scarcity economies, and the control/hoarding of resources by the few at the expense of the many. With technology we no longer need billionaires or money, there is enough for all of us, it's time to redistribute everything._ I love Ray. Stay healthy to you and your family Ray._ All common sense to some point and nothing really new, but really struggles and stutters and avoids the answer to the question: \"is it time to better pay the people and their work?\" He just says that CEO's need to appreciated for their skills in redistributing the resources (really?) and the workers just need to show \"character\"... Hmm. Ok.\nWell,change is coming, and probably people will think twice before mindlessly breaking their backs their entire life only to die in debt, while the 1% just hoard trilions for their offsprings. The world will become horribly dystopian if people won't realize now that the debt-scarcity system is just a ruse. The handouts all over the world now are just to preserve the status-quo and avoid mass revolutions/changes, and just shows that there were always - always - more than enough to go around for health/education/sanitation/housing/etc. The hoarding at the top was the only real issue here, not productivity. The very things that people all over the world demanded all along. Capitalist or socialist, all systems just sucked people into mindless slavery without ever questioning the rulers and their methods.   \nThe only other system that ever made sense - to me at least, was Project Venus , a resource-driven society balanced by AI/computers (this much was said in the talk, there is a lot of data, but hijacked by the WallStreet, in his view) with emphasis on preserving the environmental balance, avoiding waste and so on. There's also a very interesting  talk, \"The war on sense-making\" on Rebel Wisdom channel, that points in the same direction. I can't see how, with all the historical realities, we would willfully continue to be ignorant, self-destructive and in denial about our world. Peace!_ Can't believe someone on TED just said \"Euro Dollar\"...._ I love Ray's challenge to them at the end. TED seems like they tried shortly after Trump's election. But they quickly fell back into wanting to present only their polished version of things._ The greatest hedgefund manager in the 21 Century._ Hard workers  and  cash money_ Because ever since the roaring 20s there have been a lot of people bad at managing their money. Getting things on credit was introduced then. People not being able to pay back the credit caused the great depression. Which repeated with the great recession. While we do run on capitalism and that isn't bad, we need to not go overboard. Allocate resources better, that's what economics is. As individuals learning to keep a pantry is a good example economically, being food is one of largest variable expenses, and in cases like coronavirus; storms; unemployment; disasters it helps supply not run out. Start small and keep adding to it._ As the new epicenter, has New York stopped outgoing flights? Does New York not care about the world \"at all\"? Now reconsider your statements, may be there is a bit too much prejudice?\nChina sent doctors to Italy, and donated PPE etc to Italy and other countries. But Chinese companies are also selling these equipments to many countries around the world. Accepting a donation doesn't mean you have to offer these things in return for free forever.. can't believe I have to explain this.\nTry getting your information from different sources. The channel you linked is extremely negative about China. The more you watch the same type of content, the more you believe it and maybe even believe it already gives you a complete picture, while in fact you have a self-reinforced biased view._ I THOUGHT WE WERE GONNA GET A REAL TED TALK....IM DEAD_ Here, educate yourself. https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/down-rabbit-hole-eurodollar-market-matrix-behind-it-all_ @TylxrDxrdxn¬† tl:dr all the way thru but what i did was eye opening, thx_ CAPITALISM is for poor middle class. SOCIALISM is for big rich guys._ Ray admits he is a Globalist. Goes on to say that China is helping us with the virus response. Does he know where the Coronavirus came from? China. They caused this mess! Globalization has hurt the  average American by outsourcing labor to China. Ray also completely ignores the FED and how their policies have destroyed America._ I hope Ray is right regarding a re levelling of society, i am finding very difficult to imagine how the rich and powerful are going to be persuaded to allow it. i agree with Dylan btw Ray should should sit down with Joe Rogan._ New world order?!... Uhhh oh._ It strikes me that in this new economic and social reality to come you havent talked about climate change. and however,  climate is changing for the whole world too. not one word and not a single question. very disapointing\nCoronavirus is not the worse crisis, nor the biggest challenge we will face in this century, but undoubtedly it is the opportunity to do better for people and for the planet_ Take a deep breath. This virus is not a big deal as we can control it. It is having the will to control it that is lacking in some economies. Those economies will sink unless they take the necessary action. Stop the spread. That is all that is required. Stop the spread first and then take stock._ 44:09 he called Ray \"Ryan\" üòÇ_ What is the innovator he is talking about, Marco?

His head nods alot up and down almost like a tremor._ Excellent. Thank you so much. Re: ''bad news''--that a real depression is already here, and that it may well last two or three years...   For me, It was a relief to hear, because 1) I believe Ray Dalio was being absolutely frank (and truthfulness is a rare and valuable commodity now) and that is not as bad as I feared. 2) if I have an idea of what I can reasonably expect to happen, I can make better life decisions. I'm an ''early'' boomer, 73 now, and was just about to sell our home and move into a retirement community. Now I'm re-thinking the decision; there are other options. \nI'm writing from Israel, where I've lived 52 years.

Very intelligent person!  Thanks for the interview!  Rod from USA out!_ Can anyone please give a short summary of what he said? I'm ready to smash a Like for that. Thanks!!!_ even TED now wfh_ Agree, if we kept on abusing earth, a much bigger disaster will strike us than coronavirus._ Ray has lots of money invested in oil companies, so won't speak about climate change._ ‚Äã¬†@hemant05¬† thanks for the info. now I know he's not impartial so his sayins are biased and then not reliable_ Hemant oh shut up_ The position Israel is in relies heavily on the massive amount of investment America has plowed into your economy over the years._ Spoon-feeding is bad for anybody over the age of 2. Make a bit of effort to listen and understand, it will help getting more knowledge. Now we need it more than the infested with nano-particles food, air and water we have._ \"Cash is trash\" - Ray Dalio, Jan 2020_ So now we all should just stay at home, lose our jobs and not be able to feed our kids for 2 years straight? Viruses and diseases are a NATURAL thing, so is natural selection. I know that everyone has older and sick people they love. But we can‚Äôt change fundamental laws of nature. As we can‚Äôt forbid communication between people for more than 2-3 months. Every country just want to hold the virus forever or? This is not going to happen, if the country is not working - it won‚Äôt have money for the supporting old people and the healthcare system. What we are fighting for? For the next wave of coronavirus? Population immunization - this is the only way to get through it. Vaccine - minimum a year, treatment- who knows when_ China will build a new world in Chinese rule_ Cash is trash? You don't suppose espousing this pearl of wisdom  caused pain & suffering for some of your followers who followed you advice?_ Fascinating insights from Mr Dalio. Somewhat disappointing questions however: which mostly were stuck in the pre-paradigm shift world view, whilst Dalio was talking about the post-paradigm shift future._ Hello, can anyone please tell me the writer and the book name that Dalio talked about at 30:30 when he refers to one country‚Äôs vulnerabilities another‚Äôs opportunities. I‚Äôm not a native English speaker so that I can‚Äôt figure it out. Un grand merci!_ Where can I find the break down?  How much money is lent to percentage received by the lending bank.  It still behooves the lender to process the larger companies before the smaller outfits.  All the lending institutions are competing for those larger companies and as usual, the smaller companies will compete for the left over crumbs._ I‚Äôm a fan of Ray Dalio. Awesome hearing from him. Is it a good thing to keep invested into his all Seasons portfolio? 30% stock, 40% Long term bond, 30% intermediate term bond, 15% commodity, 15% gold. What do u all think?_ His ideas are brilliant. Still love Ray Dalio principles which are huge influence on me beneficial way_ Why should some billionaires stack up their money? Some billionaire's, triilionaires, as there are some in USA, their money should be taken, leaving them enough, to feed the poor n vulnerable, in this difficult time. Capitalism dies this way._ Ray is a CCP lover because he loves money more than humans._ In my opinion this is just a load of verbiage with no useful content. He's opaque, vague, waffling and unhelpful. After you have finished listening to him ask yourself: what has he said that is actually useful to you in guiding your investment strategy? - Nothing._ global global global, take a hike_ I think he's actually asking whether low paid unskilled workers need to be recognised as vital parts of any society and as such need to be rewarded adequately?\nIt seems they're not seen until they're the ones carrying the nation_ ..hmm..this maybe my first TED..in which ..I'm not sure if I learned anything..._ China should reimburse the world for their part in creating the virus and lying about it's human-to-human tansmidability._ Can we have Warren Buffet on TED please?_ The stock market is a betting market at this point.  Firstly with the FED's move to sure up credit markets, yes even junk the immediacy of defaults has been deferred.  What folks don't realize is that there is no way to figure out how exactly will aggregate demand and consumer spending come back.  A prudent investor should realize that many have been scarred by this event and saving rather than spending will start to matter to many folks.  Please do not compare this to 1918 because at that point our economy was akin to China where we produced not consumed.  The S&P at 2800 is whistling past the graveyard and clear charting leads one back to 1900 to flush the excess and correct to the affairs at hand._ We will be restructured...  as planned by the globalists.  Yay_ as always Brilliant_ Buy bitcoin!_ @fredflinstone8750¬† and then what?_ Cash is debt government issued_ cash exist just to motive people to productive_ It‚Äôs asking you to diversify.. Good lord, people nowadays.._ webfreakz wait 10 years_ Wait for the Dollar crisis after this_ I get the point, however, if cash is trash, why are so many billionaires holding it? Buffett for one. Looking to spend it on hugely depreciated assets._ @kirstinstrand6292¬† you got it :) that's indeed the irony with Ray Dalio's statement from earlier this year. Any person holding cash during today's virus-crisis will sleep a lot better during the night. That's why it was such a reckless statement from him to make in early January (even without the virus-crisis)._ @webfreakz¬† If you read carefully about his masterpiece of \"big debt crises\", you shall undertand that only during short period of credit deflation in early depression, you hold the cash and wait to invest after mass money printing_ Larry Zheng any idea where to invest ?_ @larryzheng6117¬† his book only touches part of the reasoning behind debt. I can highly recommend you to listen to Professor Steve Keen. He has even created software to run simulations of debt, credit and its interactions in the economy._ @migueis007¬† I will hold cash or gold for weeks till next MACD cross, then to start short put_ @webfreakz¬† Thanks for your recommendation and I will take time to watch Steve Keen's video. I has been watching Peter Schiff' video, which helps a lot for my dealing_ Larry Zheng sound good to me. Good luck. I‚Äôm afraid to make a move becouse markets defy logic to me_ @larryzheng6117¬† Peter Schiff is an idiot. Skip him._ World is going to punish China_ @hemant05¬† World is going to punish America because the virus came from the American Army. From Cambridge University's latest research!_ Your statement makes no sense._ I'm afraid I must agree with bighand, your comment at least begs the question as to what paradigm you are referring and what is its shift? Or if you are more correctly speaking of a change in a paradigm, from what paradigm, and to what paradigm, are we changing?_ I don't believe in long term bonds in such situation.  I prefer the rest of them_ @jihadismail8527¬† why not long term bonds_ Here, he focus on provide a view to discover solutions for global issues by learning from history cycles. It is not just an investment lecture._ @rundao8627¬† So what's his solution? Nothing but rambling discourse. This is a medical emergency, not a commercial credit bust. There is no \"history cycle\" for what is happening with Covid-19, not even the Spanish Flu of 1918. That was completely different. In my opinion this emperor has no clothes._ @JohnBedson¬† As a macro investor, he is focusing on providing clue to help us thinking about solutions and chances for economy and human society, not provide a solution to address to eliminate pandemic. The reorder of world after pandemic could benefits from his insights and clues from this interview._ TheCaptainmick this is the best statement I have heard in the last 3 months of this!!! Those people are still showing up to work!_ Yes, for example, the lowly paid cashiers and re-stocking crew at supermarkets, and the grocery delivery people, and the minimum-waged workers at fast food joints (which are still open for takeout and drive-through) ... without them, the highly paid white-collar workers who are shelter-in-home could possibly be starved to death unless they go out to get their food and staples themselves.\r\n\r\nWhat's more, I've always found that labor jobs are much more meaningful than the white-collar jobs I used to hold, all of which had always been trying to expand consumerism ... buy, buy, buy, regardless whether it was truly needed. Blue-collar labor jobs offer truly needed services or products._ It's important to see the value of those who are still delivering the goods and services. But it is important to see that the manufacturing and farm production components are the less represented at this time. And will those systems need help to structure for the future. Those systems take more spool up time to form their response_ It's a bunch of feelgood baloney.  Wages like everything else are determined by supply and demand. They're necessary, sure, but easily replaceable which is what dictates their wage._ @h4gg497¬† that ideology is why sweatshops exist and it's not a good one to hitch your mule to, unless your an advocate...\nPeople from all walks of life are more important to your life then you realise,  until catastrophe hits. This needs to be acknowledged._ The stock market has always been a betting market and will continue to be a betting market into the future.\n\nBet - risk something, usually a sum of money, against someone else‚Äôs on the basis of a  outcome of a future event._ tony frattaroli No it can be valued in a normalized environment on earnings._ Lots of China bots here, I noticed._ Dalio is a China lover.  Yes, that is true and controversial_ Education?  Really?  What are the students learning in school nowadays?  Nothing!  They just ended up with a large student loan._ Say thank you to China?  Really?  Now I believe that China hired Dalio to manage their fund.  I see your true colors...middle class America will be better off divorcing China.  The Globalist love China because they are getting richer while the middle become lower middle class or worst poor._ 48:09 Chris Andersen: \"I am also a believer in thought-LESS disagreement\"   XD_ It seemed to me like the interviewers were more concerned on what‚Äôs happening in the economy or system right now, but Ray already looked passed that, his concerns are on another level and is more on the long term. What is unfolding right now in the economy is part of a process of change that is going to come,  Ray keeps mentioning but I don‚Äôt think people are giving attention._ money money money thats all the US cares about_ Thank you, Ray!_ We are in a global economic crisis and health crisis. Will humanity come together and help each other come out of this with compassion and combine our collective knowledge to fight a common enemy or will we take this as an opportunity to fight and blame each other and close our doors? If we choose the ladder, the world will certainly change for the worse and depression to follow many decades to come._ Ray Dalio = scumbag_ A lot of people are looking for direction in these times and Ray has a really good one.

The only thing is this was already going to happen. The virus just made it 1,000 times worse and faster. Check out Dave's Trades for a trading strategy unique to Dave. I was saying that this selloff was going to happen and got the exact levels and timing correct. No one else in the world said that by march we would be 30% lower. Dalio did say we should be much lower in March but didnt give levels. I believe I know when we \"should\" keep selling._ New World Order ? Digital monetary system ?

They are running off with a nice stimulus check._ We like to be responsible and independent individuals and many of us are thinking: I'm gonna start working harder and spending less, so the next time I have good savings to not get hit as hard in the future. Some will probably be better next time but as a population, we don't stand a chance when the ultrarich keep hoarding the money, paying less on wages and taxes that can help people to better ourselves. The economy just can't work when wealth transfer keeps flowing just one way to the top and the ones just above the bottom get the credit they will eventually not be able to pay back so their assets get taken away and the population as a whole gets poorer.

There has been increasing hatred on both sides and this is preventing all of us from fighting the pandemic and fixing the fundamental problems the world is facing. On both sides Whoever is promoting this should be responsible for the great loss of humankind.\n\nI want to echo on Ray's last point, at the end of the day, whether we will come out of the crisis with a better version of ourselves depends on how we treat each both domestically and internationally. Let's have thoughtful disagreement. \n\nHope everyone stays healthy and safe!_ Thank you TED and Ray üíéüôèüèº_ Those in power, or power focus shifts in those dips. True, people adapt. However he forgets, until recent the economy was based on productivity. After we left the gold standard and introducing printing fiat money, the process changed. The impact of that can't ge assessed in trends yet...... But it could follow the trends following 2008, printing money raised asset prices, services cut, taxes increase. And people got poorer (middle, lower income ppl). The virus itself just initiated this. But JP Morgan and other investment banks were being bailed out before cronovirus hit._ Ted, please tell everybody this is the takeover of america so we can get this show on the road_ Ray is the problem with our society. He is no sage. He took advantage of many people to get where he is._ Well that's easy. It means each individual being chipped via vaccinations by our \"saviour\"  Bill Gates on behalf of his global masters all under the guise of our best interests. Now tell me; what's more important? Worrying about the future of our economy or worrying about the future of our species; our liberties; our basic human rights being increasingly squashed by these secret societies who control the global economy in the first place?\n\nAnd I thought exposing the C.I.A was hard._ It‚Äôs hard to thank a country that deliberately unleashed a virus upon the world in order to try and destroy your country. WAKE UP AMERICA!!!_ This pandemic is a glorious time for us to re-prioritize as a species. If we are to create real, long-lasting, existential change, it is time to decriminalize nature now.

This is going to take more money from the working class._ This certainly seems to be the acceptable answer, but then the CCP power play may just dominate most opinions.  ü§î_ An important meter to judge this ‚Äòstimulus‚Äô package. Whats and wheres of this ‚Äòdistribution‚Äô will tell the tale. To inhibit bad actors requires overseers that have integrity and ability for transparency to this stimulus efforts. 60% cynicism seems about right. Because at least 60% of people blindly follow the DNC & RNC. We have earned the leaders we are destined to follow. So, until we stop foolishly voting  for ‚Äòslight of hand‚Äô and ‚Äòfinger pointing‚Äô dupes to money, we will continue this._ 4_ I don't understand why in China people eat animals,why they don't stop that behavior, can you tell me l always wondered about that?_ @susanwolf3654¬† they don't have turnkey to eat :)_ ‚Äã¬†@susanwolf3654¬† Hi actually 99.99% of Chinese people eat the same thing as American people do. Fruit, vegetables, chicken, beef, pork and lamb. I personally don't have a friend eating \"wired things\" like bats. Most Chinese people do not agree with wild animal trade.\n\nAs for reason why this still exists, my observation is that there are outdated beliefs in ancient Chinese traditions /ancient medicine books that eating these \"wired stuff\" can help with health (actually this belief also exists in other part of east and southeast Asia), so it is unfortunate that there is such need and thus such market. The government is making laws to ban it._ @susanwolf3654¬† I dont understand why in America people eat crap food and lots of it and everyone is fat..and in terrible health..not smart, in Corona days_ @bosalinas6357¬† They do but at least they don't cause coro viruses,you can do whatever you want to your body,just don't cause me to get virses,and this is not the first time! Americans l know don't eat cats or dogs or bats!_ The US and China are headed for a major conflict, no way around it. I wish this wasn't the case._ @benliu9327¬† All meat eating is technically crazy. To think we need to kill to live is a huge illusion. So many alternative delisious options for sustenance that are healthier and more sustainable for all of us_ @froyo9999¬† yeah this is so called the Thucydides's Trap. From past experience it seems inevitable (there are some exceptions), we still see globalist like Ray who wants to avoid this. Let's see how history will go and do our best for the interest of humankind. :)_ susan wolf What‚Äôs wrong with eating animals? I mean, you probably eat bacon in the morning so what‚Äôs the difference between eating your bacon which comes from a pig compared to eating a dog? Does a pig or a dog have any intrinsic difference? If you complain about Chinese people eating non-farm animals then why do you eat farm animals which has no intrinsic difference compared to non-farm animal?_ Ben Liu Yo wtf, why are you trying to say as if it‚Äôs wrong to eat ‚Äúweird things?‚Äù Why is it weird?  So a bat or a pig has no intrinsic difference. They are both mammals and both have the chance of catching diseases. So people blame bats for virus but what about pigs? One of the most common meat that we eat. Are we ignoring swine flu? Or etc? No need to explain this, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with eating these animals. It depends on where people draw the line. Some people want to eat ‚Äúweird things‚Äù ok so what? There‚Äôs nothing wrong with it. It‚Äôs their choice, their personal preference. Their line. Don‚Äôt listen to these morons and don‚Äôt be influenced by them. It‚Äôs all social norm after all that has no scientific fundamentals or backing to say it‚Äôs wrong to eat non-farm animals. People in western countries own dogs as pets in their household so they get butthurt when they see dogs being slaughtered for food yet they eat bacon for breakfast in the morning coming from pigs. Wow great logic._ @hermangoering8482¬† It's because for example bats are known carriers of many diseases so when the slathering is done there is a real possibility that someone will catch some disease and  spread it among humans. \nWith farm animals we have to be in contact in order to survive , while with wild animals we don't.\nWild animals are far riskier in terms of disease because none has control over where they have been and what they have eaten.\n\n\nFurthermore in the markets where wild animals are kept they are keeping animals from all over the world in close proximity so the viruses and bacteria in them can jump from one animal to some other animal from across the world  which greatly increases the chances that the virus will mutate into something not seen on earth before and turn into some nasty disease._ Invertigo I absolutely agree with you. Wild animals are more likely to carry diseases, but that doesn‚Äôt make it wrong for a person to eat other animals versus farm animals. Im talking about that animals are all the same so there is no difference between eating a cow versus a venison. People get mad at some Chinese people for eating dogs, but I don‚Äôt see anything wrong with that. If people complain about slaughtering dog for food, why don‚Äôt we also complain about slaughtering pigs for food? It‚Äôs all social norm._ Invertigo Farm animals are only safe because they are closely monitored, but it doesn‚Äôt exclude them from contracting diseases. For example if a cow has a disease the farmers would know it right away and kill it before things gets worse._ susan wolf Why in US people eat pork and beef? Is it any problem for eating animals?_ It's may not be the people but Chinese CCP government is evil. If you haven't learned from this pandemic then you're naive. They're still covering up and censoring all the data and research relating to covid-19. Only a fool or a blind man would believe them_ @santos122122¬† excellent answer.Thankyou.l totally agree._ @santos122122¬† l really like your answer._ @susanwolf3654¬† China people eat animals, but not bats. I have been in China for over 30 years, and had never saw or heard anyone, eating bats._ Don't you think at some point we have to see who is responsible for the disaster, death,financial damage this behavior obviously coming from there should be addressed!Enough is Enough, the whole world is damaged because it than,Enough!!_ @susanwolf3654¬† WTF kinda retarded question is that. I eat animals have my whole life. I hunt and kill and eat. Stupid people and gullible people honestly believe bats were the cause. Dont be foolish, study and stay away from MSM_ King Slechtvalk Sadly, America is full of these people. Ignorant, but not willing to be educated._ @susanwolf3654¬† Not to be a whataboutist, but they should really stop adding known carcinogens like certain food dies to products, because most folks would forgo cancer in favor of colorless corn syrup water._ Kai Wang why more to the story than bat soup causing the pandemic_ @susanwolf3654¬† other than chicken, pork, we Americans also eat game meat like deer, squirrels, pheasants, ducks.  The type of meat consumed depends on what part of USA you live in.  In rural areas, a lot of wild animals are gamed for food._ ÁæéÂõΩÊ≤°Áªô‰∏≠ÂõΩÊçêËµ†Áâ©ËµÑ„ÄÇ„ÄÇ„ÄÇ‰Ω†ËØ¥ÁöÑÈÇ£‰∫õÊçêËµ†Áâ©ËµÑÁöÑÈÉΩÊòØÂú®ÁæéÂçé‰∫∫‰ºÅ‰∏ö_ @hermangoering8482¬† you seem to have a hatred for the US and Americans._ Rich but very humble_ Very rightly said_ One of my biggest idol...

What am I missing?_ @ruanorafa¬† he would not pronounce it, of course, but what he meant to say is cryptocurrency_ I disagree although I could see your point. He would mean especially if you read his work that he is talking about another fiat currency taking over from the USD just as the dollar took over from the pound after WWII. But he wouldn't say that of course as that would be very controversial as the implication is that the CNY becomes the basis of the new world order. Interestingly, the new CNY may be in crypto form._ @sickgypo¬† it could be what he was trying to say as well, Ray has been changing his public opinion about crypto rather drastically, and he is bullish on China.

Time for everyone to look deep inside and change what u can._ Ray, I just watched the discussion up to 43:39 where you talked about helping disadvantaged kids get through high school. As a former disadvantaged kid I immediately recognize a weakness they see in your argument: the influence of classism and racism. I know that most white will view as a knee-jerk complaint that minorities and the poor \"overuse to exploit the system for undeserved benefit,\" affirmative action being one of the biggest of this undeserved largess, but to get to the nitty gritty, why should some black or brown kid run the gauntlet of the educational system and associated debt in order to assimilate to a hostile work or business environment that builds in limits to his or her success, and indeed, creates life threatening hazards (Philando Castile comes to mind) when it is easier to \"stay home, stay black and operate in an alternate, unsanctioned economy?  I see well-meaning liberals teaching urban kids to learn to be classical music virtuosos but advantaged white kids have trouble monetizing a career in such fields.  There needs to be more thought invested than just getting kids through high school. That's a very low bar. The step that needs an answer is how do they monetize their education given the hostility of the larger community?_ What books do you think Ray has on his shelf?_ J Powell's printing machine goes BrrrbrBRbrBRrrbrrBBRrbRrrrbRBbR_ These financeers have huge amount of money in their pocket.

Democracy must be prevail with transparency and sharing right information. We must fight with fake news and its producers. We must resist hard on the government or regime of which would like to convey this situation to get hold of the control over the people. As you have seen in South Korea, true democracy with transparency is the best method of getting over the crisis like this. But of course there are many scums who want to take advantage over this situation. We must balance this with transparency from the government._ Historic statics proves that India has far more hydroxychloroquine, than what is needed for India & has huge potential to share the cure potential to the world around in saving this humanitarian crises. COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD MUST Move production & manufacturing companies  OUT of CHINA. CCP China must be handed in the bill for their breaches in handling the CCP VIRUS.

Please don't make China as an enemy, but as a partner to rebuild the world._ i listened to ray 's talk around Dec2019. after that talk, i decided to sell my house \"earlier\" than later. i am grateful to ray_ Playing the globalist game with countries like China (that we have been doing) that are ideologically different to ourselves is dangerous. Now more so than ever. Hopefully We will see a real growth in trading blocks of like minded countries. Here in the USA, we can continue to access cheap labor to replace China (and avoid inflation) as long as we partner with countries like our nearest neighbors eg Mexico and have a different management of labor.....but this may ? require a different president._ There is a problem with taking people's arguments so seriously just because they have authority or because they are billionaires. I admire Ray Dalio very much as an investor, but I do not fail to critically analyze what he says. And in fact, there are some absurdities behind his speech to \"publicly thank China\" when the facts demonstrate ABSURTS committed by China throughout this process. I find this complacency towards totalitarian regimes that hide the truth and oppress freedom very worrying. Although I admire Ray Dalio as an investor and for his work ethic I find this globalist ideology that he has extremely harmful._ TED has been worse and worse over the recent 5-6 years allowing complete shiiti ideas talk.

No one can be sure where this is from, even the top scientist around the world at the moment. Secondly, does it make any difference where it came from?

I love that Ray  is talking about crypto !!  27:55_ Per himself, he‚Äôs a globalist and globalists love China and hate Trump but why??_ I like ray, I know he travels to china and it's in his best interest to prop them up though. Most people look to him for advice on how to structure their portfolio to survive and thrive. I agree we don't need hatred of peoples as a whole but American leaders don't want to find themselves in second place in terms of technology and GDP with a communist country that practices organ harvesting on decenters. America should focus on being a self reliant industrial nation again , with strong ties to any market that can bring economic growth but not prop up partners that can'tbe trusted. It's hard for me to get behind thanking china for sending masks after covering up the disease that caused the demand for the masks in the first place. That isn't a political statement is it? Surely rationally America has learned that global institutions like WHO can be bought, china is running a PR campaign,  not philanthropy effort. And the best way to avoid political revolutions and war is to stay strong. Its incredibly difficult to know exactly what to do. We definitely shouldn't thank guilty parties or lower our standards in terms of individual freedom and human rights in order to be competitive which is what I fear the most._ Mostly seemed U.S.-centric apart from a little on the EU bank being smaller and emerging markets being in more trouble than the U.S._ @20:00 the connection between applying algorithmic logic to solve a problem, as opposed to, leveraging artificial intelligence to generate an algorithm appears to be an informational event horizon.

Mortgages have been stopped as well otherwise I'd buy a house._ Benjamin Ahdoot I never understood why gold. Buy land? Buy platinum? Buy bitcoin? These options are all equally speculative. And I tend to think that history will not repeat itself when it comes to gold. Who will buy gold from you when this instability is over??? Nobody. So the price will drop. I‚Äôd rather buy something I can do something with. Like land and bricks. And while I‚Äôm jobless I could have a great time building a house provided I have some food to eat. It‚Äôs better than watching governments spend billions on COVID and then take your money indirectly from your pocket. I therefore prefer to have no cash in my pocket by then, but have the savings converted into something tangible and useful._ By filthy companies, do you mean fossil fuel producers? If so I agree - fracking industry is one big money-burning ponzi scheme that should be put out to pasture, and the rest of the O&G industry is killing our planet and misallocating capital and shouldn't be bailed out._ @zholud¬† I agree.

The ability to heat your house and turn the lights on in the evening was a luxury good prior to that. If it weren‚Äôt for that energy the amount of capital to ‚Äòmisallocate‚Äô would be a fraction of what it is today. You have the privilege of condemning a resource for killing our planet whilst living off the fruits of over a century of its use. The current environmental pollution is from developing countries who haven‚Äôt had the chance to catch up with efficient use of energy yet. They‚Äôll be the ones sent back to the dark age if we halt the energy industry. That said, I agree with not bailing out companies, I just don‚Äôt discriminate which industry._ Dmitrii Zholud it‚Äôs not just about you anymore because if your savings are protected but the society you live in falls apart with mass deaths  then what would be the point of having vast savings.

Read life and work - great book, very sobering. Big debt crisis is harder to read - while I get it with debt cycles I think that economy is now more politics and psychology-driven. So many things are priced ‚Äúwrong‚Äù - that is their price is what people think it is worth (like gold and bitcoin) and not what it actually is worth if you discount for overreaction, disinformation and imposed opinions._ Gulaid M I don‚Äôt agree. While I have nothing bad to say about small and medium size companies, I think most (Not all. Perhaps Tesla is a good example of an exception) of the big companies are not sustainable and irresponsible with regards of the amount of debt and risk they‚Äôve taken and these companies (all banks included) should not be allowed to be bailed out.

Ah, the philanthropist that makes money shorting Italy during corona outbreak. Shameless_ Dalio is getting old ..._ Yes holding cash is absolutely the right decision in the short run, even though one may lose purchasing power due to inflation, say 5 to 10 % a year ( which would be more than offset by deflation due to soft and weak demand for good and services) and no matter what diversification in your stock portfolio may be, if the stock market drops 60-80% and only recovered after 25 years, and yes, you will make a fortune if you can live another 25 years. That was what happened to the crash of 1929 my friend. Nowadays 70% of American economy is consumer driven and if you are not the 10% elite and you have not much savings and max out on credit cards,   good luck!   You may hate China and believe everything the reality TV president tells you but look at the fact - Chinese families, even they have been poor, they have the highest saving rates in the world and that was one of the reasons for breakneck growth in past 40 years. Federal Reserve Bank can print another $3 trillion to save the day, but hyperinflation, loss of full faith and credibility of the green back will follow. We really need \"God Bless America\" to Make America Great Again!!!_ I do really respect Ray Dalio but one thing that I keep thinking is by looking at history we are enforcing assumptions in the world. Should we be questioning all assumptions as a global society?_ I would expect more from TED talk...this is very generic b s ...quite disappointing. questions given are even more disappointing. Reset, inventiveness, humans come together, reinvent ... what the heck he is talking about...... is this about food bank lines in Ohio or Florida? it seems that it is easy to forget about a huge part of population, whole generations which devoted their life to this system, paid in heavily into the system..... and when they supposed to eat the fruits of their labour...they find out that they are being cheated out of their savings, ripped off of everything ...and when they are no longer needed (economically) are told to \"reinvent\", come together and sing kumbaya. You can tell that now to new, young generation, yes, they will hook, line, and sinker just to repeat the history down the line and when the time (to reinvent) comes rip them off as well. the system needs fundamental changes and before that  someone needs to be held accountable for what is going on today.  talking about history....yeah, I know, memory is short especially for some._ Relax gents Donald trump admin has just found the game changer cure !

You still have to trust the algorithm and the implementation._ @JeffCaplan313¬† No you do not. Trustlessness is the whole point of Bitcoin... Bitcoin is a immutable ledger, decentralized & unstoppable because controlled by no one. Everything from issuance to scarcity, transactions & exchange to fungiblility is pre programmed & trustless._ @gaeldesmontagnesnoires¬† you're missing the point... If something is programmed, then that means certain assumptions are built into those algorithms. What happens if the algorithm or the implementation need to be patched? Who does that? \n\nSo are you suggesting that blockchain tech is equivalent to AGI and that it can patch itself? Or are you suggesting that once a blockchain implementation has started, you never have to make any changes?_ @JeffCaplan313¬† Upgrades are open source & can only be implemented by consensus. Anyone can fork the blockchain to create their own coin if they don't agree with said consensus & disapprove implementations... there are many forked bitcoin by now but there is no adoption of 80% of them._ @gaeldesmontagnesnoires¬† LOL, the same thing you described is what's done by Central Banks within each country.  Central Banks have committees which form consensus to guide monetary policy. Instead of forking a new crypto, you can currently just decide to move to another country if you don't like the decisions your central bank is making.\n\nWhat you're suggesting is that instead of trusting the \"competence\" of individuals or hierarchies, we put our faith in each other. Trust is still very much a component of this model._ @JeffCaplan313¬† except that it's not. Bitcoin is trustless unlike central banks._ Don't worry. He wants to pay higher taxes._ He‚Äôs kind of a big deal_ Ga√´l des Montagnes Noires hi Bitcoin is the Hope we needed not exactly the infrastructure we can rely on. Due to it being slow requiring massive waist of power and needing an expensive hardware just for mining plus a finite number of currency make it unsustainable. The successors of this disruptive technology will indeed be the answer to our financial problems. Something powerful,lightning fast, unhackable, that can run on low power portable devices and that is Byzantine proofed, open source and scalable. Able to keep the currency value stable. The Banks won‚Äôt go down easy though. Be ready to fight even today they could still do the same sneaky move they done to go behind the constitution and the whole world will be slaved once more. The biggest power struggle since the creation of the national banks is happening right now, you flinch and it will all be over._ @P_A_X_A_N¬† Finite is better than scarce. 1 Bitcoin is divisable by 100.000.000 there 21million Bitcoin thus 2.1Quadrillion Satoshies... plenty to go around for everyone._ Ga√´l des Montagnes Noires Quantity is not the most important crippling aspect of the First bitcoin implementation but it‚Äôs important enough that I mention it. The fact that most coins mined are hoarded instead of being used in transactions and the poor support for them to be used widely, means that as the populations grows 2.1quadrillion won‚Äôt be enough and it would take forever to aquire that many and the energy riqured would be immense making it inaccessible to most. Meanwhile the banks could just issue trillions of notes with a value of over a trillion or more as they did in Germany. Anything that challenges the FIAT currency we have today is always welcome but if we are to defeat the mammoth, all powerful giants that hold every single man, woman and child ransom with their system, it‚Äôs paramount we create a tool that is fair to all, simple and accessible so that everyone can fight at the same time and discard the world of inequality. Like with every tool some will try to use cryptocurrency  to gain even more leverage and power. We must be vigilant and not haste into something half baked or a Trojan horse. When the constitution was duped and The fed came to be everyone was watching and yet it happened and here we are again. The next move will dictate the fate of  mankind in relation to freedom, equality and the pursuit of happiness. We the people must be masters of our own destiny and not captives to our mistakes._ @P_A_X_A_N¬† When you own bitcoin you don't just own a commodity, you become an international unregulated bank.

I never understood how banks loan money from nothing and then ask for debts paid in the form of real values and labors? It is crystal clear to me what the real purpose of this pandemic is. Thank you for making it clear to me._ What's the point is asking people like these? They have investments in China so what do they care about common American. The superpower who won  world war cannot make equipment for hospital is a shame. This is entirely due to crooked people like this speaker Ray Dalio who see only additional profit at the cost of destroying the country. Shame on such people_ Ray obviously has a great grasp of Macro inter-connectivity.\nI agree with him in almost everything he said, even learned a few things from this Video ... so thank you Ray.\n\n\n\nBut his desire for the most harmonious outcome seems to cloud his judgement.\n\n\n\nExample 1, he recognizes that nation's shouldn't take advantage of the weakness of other nations, but then fails to see how China not only exacerbated the pandemic by lieing to the world, but is trying to use everyone else's suffering to their advantage. Not to mention the decades of two-faced acting before the pandemic by the Chinese government.\nHe would LIKE everyone to work together. This desire causes him to dismiss China's bad acting and instead he thanks them for their tertiary PR stunts.\nYES, it would be nice if the whole world came together to create the new system, but if we give a stronger influence in shaping the new system to those who strive for selfish self centered gain, then we will end up with a new system that is LESS harmonious than could be, if not out right oppressive.\n\n\nExample 2, he talks about the disparity in education between the wealthy and the poor. This is due to two things, and money ain't either of those things. It's the teachers unions who's job it is to protect the teachers OVER the well-being of the students, and the various political cultures that are battling for the minds of our children.\nIf public schools got rid of the teachers unions (and by extension put students first) and taught Reading, Writing, Arithmetic, History and Finance over SJW propaganda, then children would gain an education instead of a baby-sitting service. This wouldn't solve the problem. The rich will always have some advantage over the poor (music lessons, social contacts, etc.), but we could at least NOT teach poor children how to forge the government plantation chains themselves.\n\n\nWith that said, I hope those who are most influential in the coming years is as insightful as Ray seems to be and understands what is going on._ Ray, what will be the impact of the global economic slowdown on frontier markets/developing economies?_ Many, many, great points here, but let's not try to pretend that China didn't buy all our PPE in the USA and is now sending it back to us as a \"gift\" after they covered up how dangerous the virus really was.

He started out holding back and he often digresses and stutters as a way to avoid dropping the bomb, but slowly throughout the interview he gives all the honest points. Vague and cautious at times but with his brilliant brain and experience is to be expected. Forget his mambo jambo about good vs evil or any part where he goes on about the government restructuring the financial system or people making an economic difference by helping each other etc. Now in resume we are fucked, savings,debt, retirement,jobs,value of the currency, the future of the next generation. 2008 is going to look like a spa day compared to what‚Äôs coming, this pandemic is just wood in the fire. It was always going to come to this. His presence here is just for credibility and interest.

That is absolutely amazing and so very reassuring._ The idea of \"We're all in this together\" is fine and all but it seems to me that far too often the idea is used is used uncritically, as if the uplifting imagery it conjures is being referred to primarily as a means of avoiding the unpleasant fact that the larger an organization is the fewer are the values common to it's constituents AND the less meaningful any accounting of that organization's activities to any individual who is subject to the output of that organization will be.  MEANINGFUL ACOUNTABILITY is what limits social growth. It's a technical problem, not a moral one._ Hopefully this will help to understand the fictitious nature of money. \nNow more than ever,  the manipulation of a few numbers in a computer could ease a lot of suffering among humanity.\nJust we have to change the mind set, and understand that the economic system is a tool to achieve human development, the market is not the priority, it is a system that should  be used to procure global wellbeing, for the planet._ what role does automation and artificial intelligence play?_ why so many persons talking about China, China...., please stop blaming China, self-think yourself.

That is the historical constant above all other concerns._ Finally someone is talking about China without bias and saying the truth. Blaming China wouldn‚Äôt decrease US confirmed cas√©s, and Trump administration has to take the full responsibility for handling it so poorly. For those people who criticizing Chinese for hiding the truth so we can‚Äôt get information about the virus and that causes the delay for the response, lead us to the situation we‚Äôre facing today, Come on guys,  check out any mainstream media timeline, in Jan everyone is reporting it as highly contagious virus and even use a word deadly.

It‚Äôs an agreed upon wage. You go to work and what you do with your paycheck is solely up to you. I‚Äôm being as neutral as I can here because I‚Äôve been at both ends of the spectrum. Much of the problem in America is assuming that anyone that managed to create wealth for themselves did so unscrupulously and therefore should be held accountable. Or even the idea that because they were diligent and worked hard and had success, they should somehow foot the bill for everyone else that has hardship, and yes, I am sensitive to true hardship. But the majority of the population is dependent upon the system and are hypnotized by culture and instant gratification. Our consumerism is our downfall. How about we plan for the future and save instead of buying needlessly. How about instead of relying on big Agra we grow our own food. If you want to stop large corporations from doing what they do, stop supporting the idea that more is better. If everyone adopted that mentality, everything would balance out. It‚Äôs not rocket science._ James Ellis what if some people (or ruling parties) are indeed demons?_ @NeurosurgeryMD¬† well Frump and Pence certainly fit the bill- let's hope we have the strength and moral courage to vote the f'ers out of office, and the world becomes a better place._ Yes!_ So he can thanks China in public for bringing the virus to us._ Don't think he wants the stress_ Justin Like America bringing Aids to the world.

As the student of history that he is he should know that has never happened and it is contrary to human nature. Wealthy people who have power promote globalism under this guise so that poor, and powerless will surrender what little power they hold to a particular group that is in power so that they can consolidate their power and further enrich themselves._ 48:10 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm also a believer in thoughtless disagreement‚Äù üòÇ_ 27:53 = Bitcoin._ Shut up Chris Anderson_ Dalio's investors are like \"Um, shouldn't you be making back our money instead of trying to appease to your cult like followers?\"   Dalio talks and most of you hang on to his balls because he has money. He doesn't offer any insights into life which you can't figure out for yourself. He's another daddy you're looking to fill a big gaping hole in your life. Think for yourself during this crisis instead of listening to man who so obviously craves attention despite already getting enough of it throughout his life due to exactly his wealth and success. He has accomplished amazing things but what he's talking about isn't original, it isn't food for thought, it's not even \"woke\" type of thought. Most of you jump from Buffet, to Cuban, to Dalio and then back around for another circle tug. Good job for his success but you really read too deep into the mind of a man who's enamoured with his own philosophy. If money were the answer to your problems then central banks would just print your paycheck every month and feed all the people and we never have to worry about anything ever again until you realize what a bore life would be and um inflation.

Get a life._ Bernd Warnders limited resources?  I think you'll find the human being is one of the richest resources with enormous potential_ @WoWscHiLd¬† read again \" a large rock in space with very limited resources\", not humans_ Paola Z O-L The myth of limited resources dates back hundreds of years and, despite being proved wrong every time, won‚Äôt go away. It‚Äôs the same prediction every time, from Malthus (1798) to Ehrlich (1968). When a resource becomes scarce it isn‚Äôt harvested until it depletes to zero, it increases in price. As one resource becomes more expensive people seek alternatives and innovate. As @Jade Desousa pointed out, the most valuable resource on the planet is the human mind and we are in no short supply of those._ @RevoltingPeasant123¬† I may agree about human minds, but this has nothing to do with the first comment related to the Earth.\nBtw, this planet has limited ressources, is a fact, not a myth_ @paolazo-l4790¬† I respectfully disagree. There are plenty of resources which become more abundant as humans interact with them. Wheat, for example, is cheaper now with 7 billion people on earth than it ever has been in history. Farming has become so efficient we are producing more than ever before whilst using less land. The most appropriate way to measure the scarcity of a resource is to track its price and you'll find resources are only becoming cheaper and more available as people innovate around them. We are richer in material wealth now than we were 2000 years ago, not because more resources are available but because of our ability to maximise their use and efficiency._ @RevoltingPeasant123¬† Glad to hear, we face a massive lack of helium soon. Nice that it is limitless or can easily be substituted._ @berndwarnders¬† I don't get why people struggle so much with this concept. Every resource in history has been the subject of hysteria and doomsday prophecies speculating about the disaster when it runs out. Corn, wood, coal, oil - just about anything you can think of. It doesn't matter whether the resource replenishes or not. Human innovation will find a way around it. Often this happens in the most unexpected ways. Nobody expected the invention of the light bulb, for example. An invention which put a serious dent in the demand for oil._ Be more positive about dealing with others then. Its your choice how this plays out. Everyone needs to act._ @samuel: Damn right - you have reason to be pessimistic if you believe you don't have control... The truth is that we all have control... 1/8 billionth of it... But it adds up if we choose to exercise it.

You're talking in limiting beliefs. You forgoing the conclusion when you should be focusing on how you will be part of the solution. Your the pessimist._ Samuel Fitzpatrick I appreciate the optimism. Let‚Äôs all do our part and see how this all plays out.\nBtw as much as I want to believe it, not every human has 1/8 billionth of control - the control gap is just as wide as the wealth gap._ I disagree although I could see your point. He would mean especially if you read his work that he is talking about another fiat currency taking over from the USD just as the dollar took over from the pound after WWII. But he wouldn't say that of course as that would be very controversial as the implication is that the CNY becomes the basis of the new world order. Interestingly, the new CNY may be in crypto form_ Thank you. I was looking to comment and you hit the nail on the head! For example, he even contradicts himself: this will be much worse than in 2008 because of the small and medium businesses. Well, in 2008 the gov weren't handing out grants or loans or funding like they are now [even though its not fully rolled out or for everyone]. Plus the Chinese economy took a V shape return, which is what we are also hoping for. So he really can't say that, unless of course, he has huge magic crystal ball/s?! Make that of what you will._ Agreed. Thats because he runs bridgewater i guess, so doesn't want to take a stance on their positioning._ Same_ you need to check what is top scientists said about this virus. They are more clever and honest than most of us._ Most of ordinary Chinese love CCP.  The so called whistle blower for the coronavirus is a CCP member.  The media intentionally ignore this fact.

No wise lender would force a good borrower to go bankrupt, under in dire need of liquidity itself. I Think the government need do nothing more than give credit directly to the bank account of every business, small as big, that would last it for 6 months. It should be paid back gradually, maybe over decades, and carry interest, so businesses can pay it back from future earnings. There is really no need for the economy to go down the depression route in my opinion._ The problem with all these pundits is they think everything can be fixed with money and whilst that's true in part it does not account for the human tragedy. The thing after this will be famine, closely followed by civil unrest. And the collapse of society. Watch this space._ Mr. Ray Dalio is very honest. History proves he‚Äôs correct with the wars, corruption, distribution of wealth.

In short, Ray tells us what we need to hear... not what we want to hear_ The American people can't even do the right things when times were plentiful and good, and you expect them to do it now that the worse is here.

Any new money printed should go to each person in society equally, not just to bail out the rich to the tune of 4+ trillion per recession. Rewarding bad behavior is wrong._ Having a smart guy as a president don't mean the country will be great...  if you want to have a great country you need great people inspiring others and people willing to learn and follow them, which no doubt we have but unfortunately the easiest path is to be wicked and mad, people are influenced by the bad leaders easier because is the fastest easiest path.. greatness virtue take time and patience....

Great!_ People need to be lazier, shallower in character and more egocentric - that is the sign of evolutionary progress, the hallmark of refinement and the bedrock of ideological capitalism in all its underrated merit! \nBut seriously, nevertheless, capitalism's tendency (its inner logic?)  to domination and subjugation results in its monotonous and totalitarian message of \"work ( read: productivity/invention) makes free\". Capitalism's standard euphemism, that Inventiveness is the panacea of the ages, is answered by the more archaic Chinese, who greeted with bemused disdain the European inventions that forced themselves upon their attention, as \"ingenius irrelevancies\". \nIn other words, to the 'truly' civilised Chinese  mind, there are more important things than mere productivity, as productiveness is an attribute of the social inferior. To the aristocratic, civilised mind,  it is not worthy of one to get one's worldly ends and sense of self-esteem from mere inert goods and impersonal services, but wealth (which is essentially status) must be exacted through the form of an explicit relationship with living humans. \n\n\nCapitalism, like the Chinese attitude, is also just a form of cultural chauvinism; and it makes sense only in a narrow historical context. Itis really only an aspect of the same age-old but short term urge to empire-building, to exploit and colonise._ Everyone thinks the stock market is trading up meaning everything is ok. You should really look at how the stock market is doing vs. Gold. On that basis, things aren't really rising so much. Remember that in the 30s, we were on the Gold standard. So, if we think it is going to be similar, then Gold will outperform stocks for a long time.\n\n\nThe important thing that many people are missing, which is hiding in plain site is that the dollar is collapsing. In that scenario, Gold AND stocks can both go up. It doesn't mean business conditions are improving. The dollar is becoming worthless!_ TED ‚Äî- Truth Education for Dummies....._ My little peeps American Dream is to give my retirement money to Ray and Jack Dorsey to give us computers and charter schools ....

New money comes from working together, not killing each other_ CEOs need to get paid less and Farmers, grocery store workers, truck drivers, nurses, EMT/paramedics need to get paid more.

The centers being political based or wealth centered throw the economic flow into\nDistortions in which segments of a society becomed overbearing and concentrating more and more of the rewards. This virus is teaching a model. We either work cooperatively and allow people the avenues the abilities to reach personal goals or social upheaval will occur and another and, possibly mankinds last global conflict will develop. We work together now to overcome the virus in a common cause and in common effort because death is the resolute of self centeredness. Instead it requires that our actions are \nbased on morality of fairness, devotion to compassion that everyones life is important and has the opportunity to obtain personal needs and goals in a fulliness.  Another way of stating is loving your fellow man as much as you love your life in your pursues. We have been off balance for a long time. Our actions have been ego centric to the point of outright destructiveness and genocide of our own species. Our shear numbers on this planet and on each continent require will become much more conscious on our actions and how we affect others. There are plenty of resources as long as we dont hoard or act selfishly. Another aspect renew our spiritually and morality which guides our decisions. I believe this pandemic will also make us redefine how money or currency is used to define rewards for our efforts in life. Mankind for far to long defines rewards in the form of money. We now maybe should redefine rewards of our efforts? Possibly do away with currency now with the advent of quantum computers which can conduct endless calculations. \nAlso redefine materialistic needs to live life?_ It is an appropriate interview_ Meanwhile politicians, who are causing this, are immune from the financial fallout...they will get their income and the special benes they voted themselves.

What happens to those bonds then? Do they stay with the central bank, or are they sold to third parts. If the bonds stay with the central bank, the problem is essentially political, with a side order  of inflation. If the bonds spread out in the commercial banking system, then we may have a huge debt problem in the future. What happens with the bonds?_ Productivity is all well and good but we also need sustainability, we only have one planet._ Very good presentation. Thank you for sharing. One point of view that I would like to add is that a key characteristic of this particular global crisis is that all affected countries experience the same sense of pain and loss. The US, American countries, European, Asian, African we all have a single common enemy and this is unprecedented in history. Even the world wars had two sides, this time there is only one side. We should keep that in mind and maybe it will help us identify with \"the other side\" more, maybe we'll come out of it with a stronger sense of unity._ Ray is the man!

I hope the next world order can be triggered only by the latter._ He speaks in grand generalities._ 31:10 Ray is a globalist that would love smart people to cooperate_ 22:50 - are you investing based upon cause and effect relationships?_ 18:30 - necessity goods + innovators that aren‚Äôt too leveraged will do great_ 17:20 compared to 2008_ An artificially intelligent system  -selling and buying the same share in a nono second -can make money ( for few ) but don't create wealth      -financial Capitalisme - Too big to fail _\nThe Industrial Capitalisme creates wealth -   IT did it for us and it is doing it in _Asia and Africa  . \n  In the last forty years,the big loser was our middle-class in many ways .( -America /Europe /the leading economic countries )-The most well-paid segments of the industry were exported. and robotized. \n  The women entry in the workplace and their fight for their right to equally paid for the same work, a long and hard fight, hide the fact that on the meantime the salary of the men did not keep with the inflation ( in the 60 one family could live with one salary )\nImmigration put the worker in competition -Low salary for the majority and increases consumption.\nWealth wants power.

The question is whether you are a pawn or not._ Then the whole world has the same narrative... Not sure that's a good thing_ ‚Äã¬†@TheCaptainmick¬† Hmm interesting! Yet what if you can choose between 100.000's of teachers? (imagine books, podcasts, videos)_ @TheCaptainmick¬† The point I'm trying to make is not whether  we need 100 or 10.000 teachers for the whole world just the simple fact that a good teacher can have 100.000.000 students instead of a few 100._ @GP-qb9hi¬† \nI understand what your idea is and it's a valid one, in part. However this doesn't capture the entirety of what a good education looks like. If we say that a good education, at it's end point is to load young people up with knowledge, then that would be sufficient. But it's not, because it leaves out the \"how\" to implement this knowledge. I think, this is gained by face to face social interaction with your peers, I would say that there's a higher chance of honesty between peers then between a teacher and student, not to mention the fact that a single teacher couldn't engage in that many discussions. \nDiscussion about an idea is where you form you view or your narrative, once you have that you have greater flexibility in the way you want to implement it.\nI hope this makes sense. I'm not trying to argue the person only the idea._ @Susan Bara Not sure if you're trolling with this big piece of text but I read it so here's what I think. It's just a common sense to maintain safe distancing when going for test and be extra cautious because you're very likely around someone who is positive. Govts. have done more than enough to create awareness on social distancing and personal hygiene so it's not a weakness in communication by govt._ @Susan Baron ‚Äã  Dalio is talking about educating from productivity point of view. Someone who is educated, runs a business or works at a job is more productive for the economy and helps a lot of people in the system directly or indirectly.\r\n\r\nBesides, I wish there was a magical serum that could be given to some people to help them understand simple things like personal hygiene and safe distancing in these trying times._ It really was a nugget. I listened twice. Might go for a third._ @conorm2524¬† yeah, I feel he didn't fully think through that most people aren't going to do all that research and the time spent researching to divide up $50k might not be worth it. But still, his advice makes sense_ that's a fireplace tool holder_ Llf that's his murder fire pokers_ People were ORDERED back.to.work yesterday in Scotland and put ordered in block capitals because that's the was the papers had it and the front of the newsagents around here yesterday!_ It looks like a lamp doing karate_ Wish FalunGong Flourish in your country, bring people to Falungong God by excercise magics, and magically incinerate themselves._ Giulio Vannini the order is always here but earlier was fragmented. Now since it‚Äôs connected, we are the WWE spectators and they are the wrestlers who may us think they are fighting each other... and made money out of the spectators like us.._ That's my only disappointment._ He a has an understanding of the scope. You have to agree on the overall mission before we can collaborate and work on our individual tasks. The details are your individual  responsibility._ Joakim von Anka¬† yep )_ You're one of the brilliantly insightful comments here._ What currency to hold in? What investments to make?_ We have to think who have the levers/opportunity to make change. Dalio's company, Bridgewater pulled the lever down to short the European market. In same fashion we'll have to think and anticipate what organisations in power will do for their personal interests. Everyone wants to do something good for the world, but when it comes down to when his wealth/power is in danger, we can almost always predict the move._ Ray sounds like he got coronavirus lol_ Stopping this at 10 mins. That guy has just been framing his opinions as facts about the world all the way. That's not the level of discourse I would expect from TED._ 12:00 new world order is coming_ 9:20- Depression - 10% decline \n\n0% interest rates_ This Corona Tsunami will take the USA to the time of the cowboys_ You deserve a better interviewer like Trevor Noah._ Keyword: New World Order_ Those who control the system around the world in a monetary Banks they don't want you to be productive they want to keep you as a secret slave_ The American Dream came 500 years ago before we came to America as we was Europeans then we dream of coming to America because we didn't have nothing under name back in Europe_ It hurts me when I hear people say I think when they're talking._ A good question to ask to follow his thought train would be: 'can you speculate what this new world order will look like'?  He hinted on some aspects: a) people's attitude towards savings, b) countries' access to USD (or something else if outside the USD orbit), c) sharing of resources among institutions_ I am a great fan of Ray Dalio, read his book and other research article. However, I don't agree with his Cash is trash belief. Cash is king right now for small businesses that are having cashflow issues right now. Imagine someone having invested in stock market before and need cash now, he'll have to take a big loss to sell shares just to pay his bills. I think of holding cash as great insurance._ I am a great fan of Ray Dalio, read his book and other research article. However, I don't agree with his Cash is trash belief.

Imagine someone having invested in stock market before and need cash now, he'll have to take a big loss to sell shares just to pay his bills. I think of holding cash as great insurance. Plus, if you are holding on cash when markets are red, you get to pick up great assets at throw away prices._ This was already planned in before 2000 even dummy Bush jr. Said there were going to get rid of all the little businesses and just have big businesses created of course by lawmakers teen peeing slaves_ This is more serious in 2008 what you guys talking about where you learned your lesson some history Jesus Christ why are you making a program if you don't have to describe what the difference is between problems_ Mr. Ray Dalio, here's the best natural way to stimulate creativity in anyone. Very big fan of your Son's movie and his efforts. Not a big fan of Hedgers, but think you have a good heart, which is contrarian to most greedy hedgers. I'm looking for a sponsor to help propagate the importance of Music and ambidexterity to naturally stimulate neural growth in new areas of the brain that may contribute to an increase in cognitive functionality leading to more complex analytical reasoning and more creative, abstract idea genesis. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9vNTUOMUiM and https://pianowithmichael.com/knightofmusic/_ I could have been a politician but I don't like lying people sockracy politics who lie through diplomacy why don't we speak clearly and say what's going on_ Prepared questions don't work.  She asks the wrong questions to continue his thought train_ I would search for bitcoin..._ This is true.  The seeds are being laid daily but will come to fruit atleast 50 to 70 years from now.  What we know and were raised and taught has to become a only a page in history for the future generations to ignore and not learn from._ Yes but that like he says happens every 100 years. Lol_ Jerry Loza brutal but true so let‚Äôs rise above this with poise and inner strength - together we can!_ @g30rg3-c5¬† I've been trying to tell the people for a long time everybody's too busy being stupid working and not taking care of those who control Our Lives and poisonous us whenever they want_ @gerardolozadluna4149¬† We should start a hashtag moment on twitter/insta... I got a few : #endthefed #endthefiat #endtheinflation let's stop #makeamericaslavesagain moment, directed by Trump, Produced by The Fed..._ I agree partly with him as I think he believed that there would be super inflation looming that will devalue the cash on hands dramatically considering how much money Fed and Europe and almost all countries' central bank are printing. But I also agreed with you that for commoner, cash is king as no matter what, you still need to pay for your bills and meals._ @greenwater88¬† Yes, buying power of cash is reduced due to inflation. But buying power increases during recession. Govt will always try its best to keep it slightly inflated but one can't be sure when the recession comes._ Siddharth Sharma well said!_ I think he‚Äôs speaking to the longer 3-8 year term, not the short term_ May be u r not getting his true message. Imo cash trash is still valid. Since fed had complete power to lower the purchase power or \ndo wealth distribution in whatever way they want. we by holding cash  definitely lose the purchasing power. But it does not mean u have to jump into stock whenever u have penny. If u hold gold, silver or other comodities that the fed can't manipulate, ur purchasing power won't be lower overtime like cash did.  they can be liquidized quickly. I bought all gold silver and copper whenever i have cash just not to lose my purchasing power. Guess what. It is paying me off since i sell those in this crisis and buy stocks when they are lower than my intrisic value. For me cash will always be trash.\n\nBtw, i am fan of Ray as well._ @ayeminoo2067¬† Is there a particular person who taught you to maneuver the stock market?  My daughter has Ameritrade and it sure has not done anything with her money._ @bluewaters3100¬† https://www.buffettsbooks.com/how-to-invest-in-stocks/basic-course/ these courses are pretty good._ The problem is, governments are printing money like crazy so there is a high chance your cash will be eaten by inflation_ @Clikaco¬† agree, he said it contextually_ I guess you need to take Ray's statement into context. From what I believe, he's talking in terms of long-term (decades of investing) and in terms of positions (investors). When you invest long-term, what you see right now is not typical and representative of what market performs averagely. Also in regard to what you say about selling shares to cover one's bill, it seems like a liquidity issue that long-term investor should have considered before playing the game. But good question :D I'm a fan of Ray too!_ cash is truly trash. buy gold silver and crypto_ Trang Bui Agreed. That‚Äôs exactly what Ray meant by ‚Äúdon‚Äôt hold cash‚Äù as of not for a long term holdings._ @Clikaco¬† One can't always gaurantee inflation. Govt will surely want to keep markets slightly inflated but things can go into recession quickly. Buying power increases that time. People who say that they buy gold to store their money should know that even that can be manipulated by market players. Gold prices went down recently because to make margin calls, investment banks were liquidating their gold. More supply in market, less price for gold._ @Clikaco¬† agree the timeline is perhaps 5-15 years_ Here's the new direction as an adaptation to the extremely disruptive effect from Covid-19.  Video process is streamlined and will be in production in the next couple of weeks.  I do this outside of my 50+ hour/week job at big brown because I believe it can make a new paradigm shift in cognitive functionality to adapt to the new world we see coming.  I'd like to have a sponsor that can free me from my Golden Handcuffs so that I can work full-time on promoting the idea that Music and Ambidexterity will empower the mind to evolve and adapt.

If possible to be short and precise that would be much better..._ You will not find a kinder, more gentle and thoughtful advocate of capitalism than Ray. But clearly he has no real answers.

The grocery stores all close early now.  They think this will prevent the spread.  How stupid.  By shortening the window of opportunity to shop, more people have to cram into a tighter time span.  And then there is the total turtle contraction mode with the economy.  Japan hasn't skipped a beat.  They're all still going to work and their coronavirus numbers are not going up much.  They just all wear masks.  End of story.  But idiot nation doesn't have the brain power to figure that out.  Wear a mask, wash your hands, try to stay at a distance to everyone and avoid visiting old people.  There, done.  Not rocket surgery._ May the cooler heads prevail in this disturbing time._ Ray Dalio is one of the great thinkers out there on investment and economics. But I think he is losing the big picture on China because his focus has always been on efficiency and productivity and etc. A more balanced view must include civil liberty, the rule of law,  and other fundamental values that support an adaptive and inventive capitalistic system. Saying thank you to China is fine but being mute on the fact that the repressive system has infiltrated and corrupted the Western system is either short-sightedness or a deliberate suck-up to CCP_ Chris Anderson ought to have a better microphone :)_ With little economics knowledge, the talk is too abstruse for me._ this is a very powerful and sobering talk amid this sanitarily, economically and politically frustrative time. I totally agree with what Mr. Ray has said about the restructuring that needs taking to better the capitalism which can make the pie bigger and distribute more equally and forgo the political sides to act coordinately for the collective good. globalization is ideal however the truth at the moment is directing another way. hopefully, we can avoid the fragmentation and get back to the track of globalization which help generate more collective wealth and help more people into prosperity._ https://youtu.be/9khIgMjvkSc_ How is growth based on knowledge and services unsustainable?_ Just like you._ Yes!

At least here  in the United States ...And also the fact that the wealthy will never compromise ...if anything they will take more._ Alexis Fernandez Hi there, if you don‚Äôt already know Peter Schiff, check him out. He explains why the cost of education is so high. In a nutshell: Because student Loans are almost never declined, colleges know that they can charge whatever they want, which drives up prices. This ‚Äúindustry‚Äù should NOT be affected by the government due to that reason. If the government wouldn‚Äôt grant RIDICULOUSLY high amounts of money to students, colleges would have to cut the prices since no one could get such a crazy amount of money to pay for college. (Only what I learned from Mr Schiff and what he says makes sense for me. If you have a different opinion I would be glad if you‚Äôd share it.)_ Are you crazy? The reason for high education is mostly because of student loans.  Get rid of student loans and all these universities go to teaching online and prices fall by 90%._ @felicedangelo5365¬† thank you.

In Chinese terms ÊÅºÁæûÊàêÊÄí_ Thanks Ray for your honest talk.  I've seen the systematic of China bashing in the last 8 yrs from media to our government.  It's simple, we do it to protect our #1 status not because China is so evil.  If China is so evil, why do we constantly buy their products?  It's because they grew too strong that's why our government is going on the campaign to vilify China.  That simple!  We did the same thing with the Japanese until we don't view them as a threat.. just study history!  I'm not advocating China, but to understand the truth is important.

Learning how to live like Earth's poor will assist you very well indeed. (UK)_ I'll be honest. I think we are being given an opportunity to change. I think the notion that we assume we need to take the status quo and apply it to old school values is flawed. I watched a company that was rethinking car development and rather than adopting a traditional car to a driverless world, a company said what if we built cars as if drivers never existed!?

Thanks._ President Bone Spurs scoffs at the notion of wearing a face mask...hehe, I'm too cool to look like an Asian hypochondriac.  If he were smart, he would implement it into law that everyone has to wear a face mask when outside their homes.  That's the golden ticket to restarting the economy.  If everyone wore a face mask, refrained from shaking hands and tried to stay 6 feet apart, boo yah!  His precious economy could restart at the drop of the dime a mask costs.  And he'd get re-elected.  The Japanese are all working and wearing face masks.  And wait for it...no surge in coronavirus cases there.

But for me, capitalism means the reality other than the ideology. Every industrialized modern society inevitably falls into capitalism, because so far, it‚Äôs the only order sophisticated enough to put modern societies into order without causing deformity.  China is part of the capitalism world, and it follows rules of the market to run itself and to trade with the world (that‚Äôs probably why it‚Äôs not fallen apart like the Soviet Union...).

The closest it gets are the Northern European social democrats like Denmark and Sweden. Even the countries ruled by a \"Communist Party\" don't self-claim to be communist countries -- they call their own system \"socialist\", a prelude to communism.

I agree with many of his theories on localized scales. I respect Dalio in many ways. I disagree with a large number of his applications of his theories and as someone not in his shoes, I see the unintended consequences of many of the policies he advocated for. \n\nI'm staunchly opposed to the technocratic approach to governing. I'm not necessarily a populist, but I do believe in nationalism at a small, localized scale. I do understand that geography plays massive rolls in the lives of individuals. I despise the unwillingness of individuals to take life by the rains and control their own destinies. Ray believes that experts should rule disenfranchised people.

In particular, South Korea and Taiwan were very effective in getting alerts delivered to the public and moving quickly with the first cases. Here we have the old Emergency Alert System on radio and TV, and the WEA system on cellphones which is improving. The IPAWS Improvement Act (US Law 114-143) was signed by President Obama. However the possible improvements are not being made, and one example is the use of nextgen TV (ATSC 3.0) to deliver alerts to suitable smartphones, Dependence on cellphones is also an issue as the California wildfires showed, where selective area delivery via radio or TV could have saved perhaps 100 lives. The value of EAS was demonstrated in the Samoan tsunami where American Samoa had 31 fatalities and Samoa had 149. The difference was primarily due to American Samoa having the EAS activated by a radio station operator. In the current pandemic, the difference the Emergency Alerting could have made is not simple to estimate, but Taiwan having over 100 cases and one fatality (Mar 19) shows the value of this area of improvement. (addendum) Between Dec 31 and Feb 23 they sent 37 alerts and took 76 other actions according to AMA.\r\nA meeting with the International Telecommunications Union to discuss the CAP Event Terms list is scheduled for September.

(eg 20m on, 'social solidarity' around 23m)\n8) people who opt-in are likely to be more civic-minded - who will likely self-isolate, physically distance and Stay Home even without this project's intervention\n9) poorer people live in crowded, denser conditions, may work in the informal economy,  will avoid opt-in for many reasons\n10) the whole premise is 'supplier led' - that is, the idea, money, tech, data, healthcare etc is top-down - which is at a 'cognitive distance' from where, and how, much of the world lives._ UK tried to achieve herd immunity.

But tbh Google already has most of that data anyways, so I don't see the big fuss. If people do not care that Google or Facebook are tracking their lives, such an app shouldn't worry them either._ quAdxify The killer app of blockchain is whatever solves unique human identity. This is some unique physical label on each individual. At the base, Identity is the layer. On top of this, a record of 3 main things on top exists: Ownership, Status, Authority. Example a vaccination for a virus will be placed under your identity on the blockchain. This will in turn switch over your status. If you‚Äôre not vaccinated or don‚Äôt have a license to drive etc, you won‚Äôt be able to take transport, or drive your own car etc. Now the identity layer needs to be a single system or interface to a single system. The UN and ID2020 Alliance are taking proposals from tech companies for the identity layer solution. Called the Certification Mark. They are working with Microsoft, Accenture, GAVI (Global Agency for Vaccinations and Innoculation), the Rockefeller foundation and many more. So we are in good hands! \n\nNOT! This is the Mark of the Beast and 666! Do not take it.

And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.‚Äù\n‚Ä≠‚Ä≠Revelation‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠13:15-17‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠KJV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨\nhttps://www.bible.com/1/rev.13.15-17.kjv_ @defaultHandle1110¬† wtf are you talking about.

And yes the president is the anti christ, I agree ;D_ quAdxify i do my know who antichrist is. But you better get real about the whole ‚Äòblockchain will liberate humanity‚Äô type hope. If you know what was being said by IBM, and other big companies IDENTITY is the number one problem. Blockchain will be based off the id2020. You think people can hide behind algorithms ? I think the the current situation shows you, a bullet will put anyone‚Äôs algorithm to rest. When blockchain does work it will for for UN SDG, and the NWO will control everything._ Agreed. The hash index of the block points to the set of Bluetooth contacts each day which are all hashed. The blockchain on each device stays private and is deleted when someone tests negative. The blockchain is published for someone who tests positive. The sequence of blocks can be auto-trimmed to hold no more than 14 days. Each device checks its hash against the published list of positive-connected hashes._ @RupertBruce¬†Thank you. That's kind of how my thoughts were going.  I wish I had more practice about setting up systems, but I bet someone around does. That's why I put out the idea, in case someone reading this does._ Not needed.

Four of us were to attend, which we had to drive to a town close to our camp and stay at a hotel and show up for the course daily. We went out drinking the first night as we have been working out of a dry camp for like 45 days by this time. I smoked a joint at the bar and another guy did a line of coke, which wasn't my thing but what ever, each to there own. On day 3 of the course, our instructor did a random drug test, The guy that did coke passed and I fail for smoking a joint!!!! Tell me how that works and is fair, since it was days after we went to the bar, and why does a company get to decide what you do in your off time? Then the obvious, Coke only stays in the system for 24-48 hours, weed takes 30-45 days!!!

The mechanic is looking for the mechanical reason, why the car isn't behaving properly._ Mike Trieu the Body feels everything even this can be connected to and controlled with the correct understanding._ The switch goes both ways_ First of all, the mice aren't being tormented, and second of all, it's just a couple of mice for the future of every single person in the world._ @zubbyzen3906¬† Yes, they are, and no we don't have the right to torture another life form to find things out selfishly._ ScepticalCynic¬† Yeah, like humans are better than other life forms???_ If you don't want them to use animals then I'm sure they would appreciate it if you volunteered to let them test it on you._ ScepticalCynic¬† wait, surely you didn't just compare a mouse to plants, rocks and molecules? Is there not something fundamentally different between these and a mouse to you?_ ScepticalCynic¬† I realise that was what you were questioning. I don't think humans and mice are equal but let's not be so narrow-minded to assume rodents couldn't have broken out to be the more cognitively capable mammal üòâ_ ScepticalCynic¬† unfortunately she doesn't even mention those kinds of patients because all she can do if affect simple mechanisms like hunger_ I agree!! Also 12.00 why do we need to believe that the mind comes entirely from cells in the brain in order to end stigma?? Why can't we accept the importance of mental health even if it's more psychological than biological?_ @catlover-hq4dt¬† 100% truth!!! You're right, I don't get it either. It bugs me so much!_ Science that puts even more nails into the coffin of mind-body dualism._ we are the mouse. Prove me ...(Too Busy trying to survive to considering...)_ So... It's possible to control people's behavior with electromagnetic radiation?\n\nTime to make a tinfoil hat_ If it is what she says then what about creativity? Can it be cultivated in each human in the exact same way? Are we just machines? üßêüßê_ This does not necessarily demonstrate that the brain creates the mind. This may just as easily demonstrate that she has found a way to override the mind's control of the brain._ Wonderful hope üôèüèªüíñ_ Amazing_ I agree that the mind arises from the brain and that effective treatment for mental health disorders relies upon reprogramming the brain. Current treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy seeks to change mental habits through repetition. I hope that even if physical reprogramming of the brain becomes possible that we don‚Äôt discount the power we already have over our own minds._ Light sensitive mices lol!_ I agree mental health treatment is ineffective these days but having a cure would be incredible but i think teaching someone how to change their brain through neuralplasticity is better than manipulating their brain function._ Will the researchers be sending a tiny mouse into our bodies to see if it can find it's way to a place where the light is visible to them or will it just be a microscopic robot trying to be the mouse in the maze?  Either way, I suspect that there is a lot of information that these \"researchers\" are not telling the public.  I doubt most of us could grasp the truth anyway.....so I won't be using the 5 second rule when I decide it's time to lick the floor beneath my feet!_ Study Plasma Physics and Electric Engineering üòç_ Being able to tune individual neural circuits may technically be possible, but I think it will prove to be way too invasive/expensive/impractical... Psychedelics seem like the most powerful tool we have for \"reprogramming neural circuits\" and they're not mentioned here at all._ All is physical. üíñüòé_ as a psychology student, i think this brain mapping is utterly fascinating, but what we need isn‚Äôt a revolution on treatments. it‚Äôs a revolution on perspective, human experience, and knowing how the brain gives us what we need already. fixing it with ways that communicate to the brain in ways we can‚Äôt. we should work with it, and communicate with it, more than we should try to know every crevice of its entirety. we are communicating with ‚Äúgod‚Äù trying to understand the true nature of our consciousness and the deepest pieces of us. we can‚Äôt. we can‚Äôt conceptualize it as it‚Äôs end. to make a science fiction reference, i hope we make friends with first contact and not tear open its skull to peek under the hood._ Research focused on survival behaviors is one thing.

Those that don‚Äôt directly serve a life or death roll?_ Advocating rodent torture is not my thing and I‚Äôm a psych person._ @neuralink_ Basically accelerated and manipulated neuroplasticity?_ Hello from Russia!_ Apparently it requires brain surgery, implants and a flashlight. You're safe as long as you haven't had any alien abduction episodes lately. Missing any time?_ Imabot Tripleought Yeah, none that I recall. I swear though, if I see any government mandating that chips be implanted in people's heads \"for their own safety\" or something, I'm going right back to making this hat. Once things like ID2020 get more popular, I wouldn't put it past China for example to use its power exclusively benevolently. \nThe reason I said electromagnetic radiation and not just light is because I don't see why it wouldn't be possible to implement DNA from things sensitive to other parts of the spectrum which can pass through skulls.

Not everything can be fixed by perspective._ I never want to have a therapist like you, the fact that you think everyone can heal themselves is unrealistic, this is a step in the right direction to help treat people with chronic mental disorders._ Also?

Its not like shes giving an alternative, shes just explaining the brick wall we've hit, and hasn't explained why we can't just alter one brain circuit in humans to change one specific behaviour. Its way more complicated to do that, and chemically not possible as of now._ Interesting_ üß†_ Yeah it's brain_ Oh boy mind control\n.\n.\n.\n.\nYour gov't has recommened and demands your immediate reprogramming._ She owes a lot of her research to John C Lilly MD and I'll bet you she would not deny that a Pioneer in mapping of the brainüòÅüß†üëÅ I love smart womenüåπ_ Exactly, who are we sharing our world with? This is the first step in mental health._ Since I read about this I was terrified and ecstatic about it._ Ya boi_ hi_ Explain more a bit more. So, like how is it a brick wall. I am a law student. Ahaha little knowledge in this discipline._ You‚Äôre right. If she‚Äôs studied any philosophy, she‚Äôd realise the many brickwalls philosophers have faced too when discussing the nature of the mind. She thought she had a eureka moment there connecting the hunger reactions of an algae to a mouse and then proceeded to  insist that in the future us humans would have all the mental health issues settled, when we could all find those pathways and specific neurons in human brains to zap. Isn‚Äôt that like the electric shock treatment some mental patients receive? Shouldn‚Äôt she finish her research 1st (on what was it? The effect of light on specific neurons in mice?) before making false claims on any breakthrough in mental health treatments? I was hoping her eureka moment was to recognise the importance of light on specific neurons and maybe find out how different types of light on the same neurons could differ in effect. Surely a discovery on effect requires further hypotheses and variable testings._ @sharini65¬† well what you say make sense but I will point out that she's educating the public so not just university students. second of all she mentioned that her main point was that people of suicidal, shooting tendencies could be prevented with self awareness and other treatment interventions._ Dw it's the next generations that will be engineered to be controlled hahaha._ Perhaps it is just a form of \"mind demographics\", so the researchers can get the lay of the land as they attempt to go where no man or woman has gone before.  Don't get trapped in my mind, unless you enjoy a captive lifestyle.  LOL.

I just don't like people who think they're smart and think it's okay to be cruel to other animals (this tends to lead to being okay with being cruel to each other/ourselves). Put yourself in the position of the mice. Also, unfortunately, 'mind controls the brain' is not smart, it's not even simple, it's misguided and lacks understanding.

I think dark matter density is the limiting factor to the speed of light and that gravity and dark matter density bend/pull on light (and everything else), not 'spacetime'.  I think quartz pulses and atomic clocks are induced to operate more slowly when traveling at high velocities in space, slowing our measurements of time, not time itself._ You have THE BEST BEST BEST BEST BEST JOB EVER!!!!!!!!!!_ Very interesting talk. But Jill Seubert is only talking about one of the many, many challenges we face in space exploration. Depending on the specific nature of the mission, many other problems remain unsolved. The elephant in the room is propulsion. We have gone as far as we can using liquid hydrogen and hydrocarbons._ Accurate time-keeping is also necessary for navigation here on Earth if you don't have access to GPS. Hundreds of years ago at sea they could determine only latitude with reasonable accuracy until decent timepieces were invented._ In One Piece (japanese manga/anime series) the seamen in the Grand Line use a speciall compass that \"charges\" the location with each island they encounter...

That's comendable._ Beauty and brains. Love this Ted talk ‚ù§Ô∏è_ Community, I have a question, just a question. \nWouldn't it be better if people worked on an AI that automatically improvises in space, on that spacecraft, in various scenarios like incoming asteroids and course alterations? I mean, it makes the thing drive itself in space, going to the destination it was initially programmed to go to, now, a deep space atomic clock in the telemetry would be almost unnecessary as long as the entire program has to be rewritten, as in, when a mission is added or removed, or when the destination is changed, but that only means that the planning before launching the craft on its mission just wasn't up to its own mark. \nSo, how about one spends resources and time training and building an AI to steer the spacecraft, ( of course, the clock is just as important, people do have second thoughts here and there, as improvisations or as corrections.), instead of focusing so many resources in the clock, considering that the AI is also equally as important, but just isn't developed so severely?\nI'm just saying, instead of an RC car in space, why not just put in a self driving Tesla? The remote transmitter and receiver are also important to develop, to account for help in second thoughts about the mission. But I think it would be much better if people spent a ton of time building the space craft whilst testing it before launching it into space, particularly building and testing and training the on board AI. And by a ton of time, I mean, a ton more than the ton of time that they spend normally. \nI may be wrong and do correct me if I am wrong. \nI'm intrigued and curious, and I want to see if my idea is something that has potential of being real, to see if my idea isn't so bad. I just want to see if it is or isn't bad. I'm happy with either answer. Just curious, just wanna know._ Wow she looks like Amy Adams_ This is a good idea, and it's being worked on, most especially for space guidance and navigation, but also for ground navigation of, e. g., Mars rovers.  One goal is to allow the spacecraft to make mission decisions autonomously, so it can react to circumstances and take actions without waiting for ground control -- especially when such delays might cause loss of mission objectives._ @pseudorandomly¬† oh. Well, that's a step forward. I hope they work harder on that. And hey, do you have a link or something for me to learn a bit more about that stuff since you said it's being worked on?_ @lorddarthrushirious9256¬† A google search for \"artificial intelligence spacecraft\" turns up a number of good articles from JPL, NASA, and others._ @pseudorandomly¬† thanks, man._ I would listen to you forever!_ Wow_ Cabbies need a miniature atomic clock as well, maps would work better_ 2020:  We need a small atomic clock!\n1964:  Hewlett-Packard 5060a - Hold my beer._ Wow she is soo annoying_ u can navigate me baby_ Fantastic üëçüëè_ Revolutionize space exploration?!?  You mean so that it produces an actual return on investment? That will never happen. There is nothing so pointless, so worthless, so meaningless as \"space exploration\".   There is nothing \"out there\" that cannot be found here on earth at least a million times more cheaply. If some billionaire wants to throw his money away on space exploration, I say \"more power to you\".   But let's not throw any more taxpayer dollars down this ridiculous rat hole._ What about creating Quantum Entangled Atomic Clocks? That way we wouldn't have to wait for a signal, our telemetry would be instantaneous._ World's smallest atomic clock!\r\n\r\nBit of old news here, figures that Americans still have their heads in the sand, but these things were miniaturized years ago and could easily be on all spacecraft.

Your not reliant on GPS if you have a reliable miniaturised atomic clock.  I imagine they are pretty close to acheiving it allready or that they actually have achieved it, but are keeping it secret._ Half of me loves the idea of visiting the planets of our solar system and beyond but how stupid we are as a species to spend so much money, time and resources on trying to leave paradise (earth) we could fix the planet we own with half the budget spent on NASA let alone the other space programmes the other countries have \nSo much intelligence wasted on boondoggles_ About an decade ago, there was some news about atomic clock that would be really inexpensive and small, and that claimed accuracy of 1 second ever 300 years, then nothing after that. It's nice to see someone trying again. What is really needed is a Sun orbiting satellite's constellation that multi-purpose, space navigation beacon, space based internet router, space objects collision detection system, and like she said gravy wave detection, based an atomic clock, this would make John Harrison proud if he was still alive._ That's right, don't move outside of the red circle. Keep your distance._ So tell me...(might be that im not that bright) but talking about a unmanned shuttle and about landed rover are two different things. We dont need to fit an atomic clock into a rover, if we need a smaller atomic clock it would be for the shuttle not for the rover. And if the shuttle IS the rover then its kind of stupid not to cover it with a protective sheilding.\nTruth is that we really dont need new smaller atomic clocks because technology that got mars rover there, well it works, and in this talk she hasnt said any applicable reason for the new atomic clocks. Space, while it maybe uncharted, is and probably will stay mostly empty. \nI am glad that she talks about Han Solo cause it was castle run that inspired a channel called \"film theory\" to calculate the possibility of a spaceship hiting something at lightspeed...it was close none AT LIGHTSPEED. So why is she talking about it like it would be problem for a shuttle that DOES NOT move close to lightspeed, i mean not even nearly.\nPlease! Please! Please! Let people on to the Ted talk stage that actually know theyr stuff. Her entire speech could be fit into one sentence, instead she wastes everyones time exacly 11minutes and 20seconds._ Gus More harder to do I suppose, but I‚Äôve thought about it_ Sorry.  Can‚Äôt be used to transmit information._ So did Mass Effect 2 had it right?_ Pairs of photons, neutrinos, electrons, molecules or small diamonds can be quantum entangled. Macroscopic objects like a pair of clocks cannot be quantum entangled. Quantum entanglement occurs when a pair or group of particles is generated or interact in a way such that the quantum state of each particle of the pair or group can't be described independently of the state of the others, even when the particles are separated by a large distance. Entanglement produces correlation between measurements performed on entangled particles but any transmission of information at faster-than-light speeds is impossible._ Quantum entanglement was experimentally observed in 2019 just upto 50 km. Being a recent technological concept it might not be used for another couple of decades I think._ According to Einstein's relativity, there's no such universal clock. Each single point in the universe has its own time. So we need separate clocks! And entanglement cannot be used to synchronize as already mentioned._ Thank you for your_ Post ppppppppp_ \"Recalculating...  turn left now...  tsk, your OTHER left...

Wonderful!_ As if exploration is worth anything until activists create an earth we can live on peacefully with longevity_ @nickcherries¬† I'm sorry but I have to disagree. Modern activism seems to be more about complaining and being angry all the time than trying to bring about practical change._ DemonizedTX , there is a lot to be angry about and a lot that is not getting changed. Climate change being the issue that dwarfs all others_ @nickcherries¬† explore what went wrong or is frustrating in your personal life to the extent that you have become ideologically possessed and feel the impulse to tell other people how to live their lives. The more of a tyrant you want to be over others, the less self control you tend to have. Do some introspection and escape from the dead end path that you are on, for your own sake and the sake of others. Good luck._ Also, these kinds of topics aren't divisive. That's a big plus for just about everyone._ NietzscheanMan , nvm I looked at ur profile and ‚Äúancap‚Äù is a large playlist so you aren‚Äôt worth taken seriously even if you‚Äôre being genuine, absolutely hilarious ideology_ @nickcherries¬† my political views never hurt anybody, what about your death cult? In all seriousness, I was being genuine. The amount of hatred and (self)loathing that underpins a socialist mindset is not healthy and will lead you to nowhere in your life. The sooner you take responsibility for your life and have others take responsibility for theirs, the better you will be. Don't waste your short amount of time on being a frustrated loser who tells himself he's saving the world while fooling nobody but himself and the other dregs of society about the reality and pitifulness of the underlying condition. It is not befitting of a grown man. It will reflect on you and it will reflect on the quality of people you attract around you. In the end you'll end up alone, with a purple haired landwhale or some other form of broken crazy woman if you yourself bring that mindset to the table. Don't do that to yourself, seriously. All the best, truly._ NietzscheanMan , yikes you‚Äôve got a lot of issues to deal with, Ancaps really seem to project their self loathing, someone must‚Äôve tread on you pretty hard bud_ @nickcherries¬† the only one you are fooling is yourself. Before saving the world, save yourself first. There is a lot of interesting literature on this and the same scenario plays out over and over again, it is stereotypical beyond belief. 10 years ago I would have mocked you over your beliefs and would have seen them as a declaration of war to the good people of this world and a sacrilege to the millions that were killed in the name of the cult which trapped you, which in essence it comes down to. Try to read The Gulag Archipeligo. At this stage however I understand what lies at the core of the socialist mindset and can only pity the waste of time and potential that you are bringing down on yourself. \"Plus est en vous\" as they used to say back in the day. Don't repeat the mistakes of your weak father who apparently either drove you to this sjw mindset or did not prevent you from landing there. Otherwise, give my regards to the landwhale and don't say that some random guy didn't tell you so 20 years down the line :) Human to human though I genuinely hope you'll cut yourself free from the dead weight that is dragging you down to marginality. Be a man._ NietzscheanMan , long winded and vacuous of any meaning, I hope you‚Äôre old bc seeing this close minded defeatist attitude is pathetic to see in someone who‚Äôs young. Try not to get left behind in outdated thought while we move further into progressive visionaries_ @DemonizedTX¬† You didn't like a) being told, rightly, what you know you should be doing b) 'feeling bad' because you were reminded of things you know you should be doing.\n\nDon't blame the messenger just because they have an unpalatable truth._ @telectronix1368¬† The problem with the \"messenger\" is that they're not saying anything we don't already know. I am not even a climate denier and I'm getting tired of activists, mostly because they don't bring anything new to the table. They're not offering any solutions. We should be encouraging people to work on practical fixes and highlight successful entrepreneurs like Elon Musk. Instead we prop up young activists that have no idea what they're talking about and have unrealistic goals. Even when governments take action and move in the right direction, activists are never satisfied. It's never enough.\nIt is true that we have a massive task to solve in climate change, but catastrophizing the issue is the wrong approach. We need practical, physical, real-world engineered solutions, we have enough activism._ @DemonizedTX¬† \"The problem with the \"messenger\"....\"  is that they remind you of things you find uncomfortable._ Galo Aguirre No_ @ALANcR1980¬† , good to know.

I'm sure she could accurately TIME the destruction._ Are people not allowed to talk about politics and such on TED?_ Dodger the Crocodile When it all boils down to ‚Äúmen bad‚Äù or ‚ÄúLETS DECOLONIZE EVERYTHING‚Äù then no._ @Xalvic¬† I don't think anyone has ever said \"Men Bad\". They probably said something that you took as \"Men Bad\" but was actually just about toxic masculinity or something. Toxic masculinity by the way isn't saying masculinity is bad, it's describing the traits of masculinity that are bad, like aggressiveness and being easy to anger. In that regard, there is also toxic femininity, like being submissive or apathetic. I have a feeling you're the kind of guy who says it's sexist to point out that men commit most crimes or something._ Bin , but yes let‚Äôs decolonize everything_ @OzCroc¬†  Seems you are trapped in a bubble there, dear old croc!

She deserved those many rounds of applause üíñ_ Nice talk and love her outfit. Very important issue that needs to be solved soon. People are trying to address it with different approaches. I found wiseper.com, they try to solve this issue by crowdfunding and collaboration. Helping people to see alternative perspectives is an essential tool.

This Chinese monopoly being us to our destruction. China should be abandon by companies for mass production_ I‚Äôm Chinese, I know how CCP can sneak in without your notice, just like Coronavirus._ It's limbic resonance... not allergy._ Why is no one mentioning her amazing outfit? Makes her look like a goddess_ She recreated LSD._ I like the idea. But, reframing perceptions using technology removes the friction that humans need, to understand what is going on. \n\nSuggestive technology is no better than cognitive bias._ I thought the same thing. Mental beauty makes the physical so attractive._ Are you blind?_ Oh boy, you'll regret it instantly_ Her dress is so nice_ üôÑ_ All she's missing is a hood and a wolf._ Because what she has to say is more important than what she's wearing_ Spent half the talk wondering how that dress is structured and how to put it on_ Guy here!\nWe don't care what you're wearing. We actually listen to what you have to say._ I was about to say the same thing. I just watched another Ted and the Neuroscientist was so badly \"presented\" that I was having a hard time focusing on what she (yes, it was a she) was saying. \"Dress the way you wanna be address\" I always eard, and this lady nails it._ That's the actual reason I clicked on the video. üòÖüòç_ Actually I think it is connected to what she says. She's talking about making red things bigger and smaller and by wearing a big red dress, she is making herself (and the impact of her ideas) bigger. Except the audience members don't wear large helmets._ YeahÔºå her dress looks amazingÔºÅÔºÅ‚ù§_ I believe her intention is to find a way to get us out of these echochambers of reenforcing our own existing ideas, to give us back this friction and get people to allow their ideas and opinions to be challenged again_ @directoryerror6653¬† Yes, I think that was her intentions, that's why she said it's the problem and the solution._ Great job üòäüëå_ Useful information many many thanks for the useful information_ Good sharing üëçüëçüèª\nCEO‚ù§Ô∏èüåπüôè_ https://youtu.be/qn7V6gLjC7o_ I love her talk!

Who thinks with unanimity need not think.\"\nOriginal in Portuguese: \"Toda unanimidade √© burra. Quem pensa com a unanimidade n√£o precisa pensar.\"_ She had done a beautiful job explaining  the complexity of bias. I would love to see other people's views highlighted as \"out side my bias\". Along with the others that are inside my bias. Not to metion she is beautiful herself._ Beautiful._ um.. i have adblock_ I would totally install this plug in_ This is so important_ We love you ted we do 1:23am I'm up for ted talks! X_ Could be great for youtube. Some comments are just garbage, straight up spam_ I do maths as well._ Maybe the problem is in you._ @Raphael3032¬† No, it's TED and its apologists._ Nah. It‚Äôs definitely you._ @Vena_Vena¬† ...said an apologist._ This isn't the place to post this question; TED doesn't do news, it allows people to do presentations about their ideas. I know I really shouldn't engage with this but fine, I'll bite. Maybe it'll help someone understand. \n\nHow did it spread? People are travelling all over the globe, all the time. Millions a month. As you may know, the virus is very contagious and many people don't show symptoms or if they do, it's flu-like so no one thinks much of it. A lot of people from all over the globe go to China to do business or to simply travel. Anyone could get it and then travel back to the US or Italy or wherever else and bring it with them. Italy and the US are quite common travel destinations. That's how it spread. Frankly, we don't even know for sure where it came from. If you think China specifically sent people to the US and Italy to purposely infect and kill people there, you're in conspiracy theory territory. \n\nWhy weren't there as many casualties in Beijing or HK? Mainland China is very secretive and doesn't always tell the truth. No one really knows how many people are infected in China or how many people died. For all we know, there were a lot of casualties but we don't know. I don't think anyone can really trust what information comes out of China because they've said and are saying things that aren't true e.g. info about the uighurs. Besides that, have you seen what China has done to contain the spread? They went to extreme measures and most people would consider it to be inhumane e.g. welding doors shut so infected people couldn't leave, dragging people out of their houses to be moved into quarantine, punishing people who weren't following instructions to wear a mask by literally tying them up to poles outside. Basically, they quarantined by force. If that happened in the US or Italy, fewer people would've died. \n\nWith HK, a lot of people were already staying inside because of the protests. On top of that, in Asian culture, a lot of people wear masks on the daily because of the pollution and avoid social contact with others so that minimised infections early on. In comparison, Italians are quite affectionate people as far as culture so infections spread much more easily and rapidly. Not only that but the population there is older than most in general so they're already high risk, meaning higher casualties._ Rebecca Leeman¬† is more than just conspiracy theories, is racism._ @wolfferoni¬† Thank you üôè_ Tell us how America spread H1N1 and flu, and people not say a single word about it. America did better job of brain washing than China. Actually CCP should learn more from the US about propaganda to rob others withoht notice._ Are people blind? This is an average looking woman._ No, it's freak show garbage._ I hate Ted. I signed up when it used to be constructive speeches about tech or social themes but now it's just some sjw or 'think outside the box, be a good hipster' thing._ Cringe_ Are you blind? This is an average looking woman. Unless you have yellow fever._ Exactly, like my comment! It provides no value. I'm just acknowledging that what I'm typing is pointless. I've taken up a line here, but I really haven't said anything!_ Very interesting. Hope you continue these ideas. Well done :)_ Only retarded people comment on a video and say he look man I'm first, do you have anything constructive to say other than first, moving on now, this video is interesting I like how this tech is filtering out the negative and showing as she says how things really are üòÅ_ Good_ Fascinating_ ÿ¨ÿ≤ÿßŸÉ ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá ÿÆŸäÿ±_ FIRSTTTTT!!!!!_ wow_ Fyrst lols_ interesting!!!

         "Hi there. I'm actually watching this in 2024. It feels like I'm coming from the future. I am, in a way. It amazes me how everything Liz said stays true outside the context of a pandemic. It's a great experience of love witnessing people organizing these sort of thing back then so that they could help other people in some way. It is 2024 and I spent an hour watching this and taking notes and I was helped by people from the past. By something someone once said. Acts of love last forever. Thank you :)_ 00:00 Chris Anderson welcomes Elizabeth Gilbert, author of \"Eat, Pray, Love,\" to discuss creative living beyond fear. \n00:12 Chris Anderson greets Helen Walters and asks how she's doing. \n00:15 Chris Anderson acknowledges the challenging times some people are facing and hopes the conversation will provide therapy and help. \n00:18 Chris Anderson mentions the emotional landscape of our lives and introduces Elizabeth Gilbert as an extraordinary author. \n00:26 Chris Anderson acknowledges the tough times some listeners may be experiencing. \n00:32 Chris Anderson hopes the conversation with Elizabeth Gilbert will provide therapy and help. \n00:39 Elizabeth Gilbert is introduced as an extraordinary author known for her best-selling success with \"Eat, Pray, Love.\" \n00:49 Elizabeth Gilbert's favorite book, \"Big Magic,\" explores creative living beyond fear. \n01:08 The conversation will focus on the emotional landscape of our lives and creative living beyond fear. \n01:15 Elizabeth Gilbert's writing describes the emotional landscape of our lives in a unique way. \n01:21 Elizabeth Gilbert's writing resonates with readers beyond her target audience. \n01:28 Elizabeth Gilbert's TED Talk, \"In pursuit of your creative genius,\" reframed how people think of creativity. \n01:46 Elizabeth Gilbert is welcomed to the TED Connects stage. \n01:59 Chris Anderson asks Elizabeth Gilbert about her current situation in New Jersey. \n02:04 Elizabeth Gilbert is in New Jersey, living alone in a house in the country. \n02:15 Elizabeth Gilbert has had no human contact for 17 days, except virtually. \n02:30 Elizabeth Gilbert's experience of isolation relates to what many people are currently experiencing. \n02:36 Isolation brings difficult emotions, which will be discussed in the next hour. \n02:47 Chris Anderson lists the topics to be discussed: anxiety, loneliness, curiosity, creativity, procrastination, grief, connection, and hope. \n03:02 Elizabeth Gilbert agrees to discuss the wide range of human emotions. \n03:15 Anxiety is a prevalent emotion during these times, affecting oneself, loved ones, and the world. \n03:25 We are all going through a difficult time. \n03:28 Liz, have you been feeling anxious? \n03:31 EG encourages self-compassion for difficult emotions. \n03:36 EG admits to feeling anxiety. \n03:37 Feeling anxiety is normal in this situation. \n03:43 Don't shame yourself for feeling frightened and anxious. \n03:45 EG advises showing compassion towards yourself. \n03:48 Give yourself mercy for the difficult emotions. \n03:50 Understand that your emotions are understandable. \n03:54 Don't let your emotions about emotions become a bigger problem. \n03:58 Feeling frightened and anxious is okay. \n04:01 Don't layer shame on top of your anxiety. \n04:03 Don't feel like you should be handling it better. \n04:09 Don't feel like you should be doing isolation better. \n04:13 Don't feel like you should be creating more while alone. \n04:16 Don't feel like you should be serving the world in some better way. \n04:18 Multiplying suffering by adding shame is not helpful. \n04:21 The antidote is showing warm, loving compassion towards yourself. \n04:23 Be kind to yourself if you're feeling anxiety. \n04:27 If you're anxious, you deserve mercy. \n04:31 Anxiety is a form of suffering. \n04:33 Show mercy to yourself if you're suffering. \n04:36 The central paradox of human emotions is anxiety. \n04:39 Humans are the most anxious species on earth. \n04:42 Humans can imagine a future, which causes anxiety. \n04:49 Humans are both emotionally bad and good at fear and anxiety. \n04:57 Humans are anxious but also capable and resilient. \n05:04 Humans can imagine terrifying possibilities. \n05:16 Anything can happen to anyone at any moment. \n05:23 Humans can imagine scary scenarios. \n05:33 One of the scariest things is happening now. \n05:43 Humans are emotionally stirred up by their imaginations. \n05:50 Humans are also capable and resilient in times of change. \n06:07 Humans are good at adapting to change. \n06:15 Remembering our adaptability can help reduce fear. \n06:25 Look at history and personal experiences to find resilience. \n06:37 Recognize what you have survived to ease anxiety. \n06:43 Panic and anxiety about the future harm the nervous system. \n06:48 In emergencies, intuition guides people on what to do. Trust your intuition when the point of emergency arrives. \n07:32 Fear is there to direct behavior and avoid danger, but it can get out of control. Turn fear into something useful. \n07:58 Amanda Eller's survival story shows human resourcefulness and adaptability. She asked for her fear to be taken away and replaced by intuition. \n10:00 Intuition can guide us in the moment, eliminating fear. Surrendering to intuition leads to a navigational system within us, telling us what to do. Being present and avoiding thoughts of the future can prevent suffering. \n10:40 Practicing spirituality or meditation prepares us for moments like these. Liz emphasizes the importance of focusing on the present moment and letting go of the future. Many people are suffering emotionally during this time. \n11:55 Loneliness is inevitable, but it can be faced. Liz has experienced isolation before and suggests walking towards loneliness. Developing compassion for oneself is crucial in enduring solitude. \n13:35 Loneliness is a problem, and people need kindness towards themselves. It's an interesting time to practice self-kindness. \n13:46 People are avoiding isolation by filling their time with constant online meetings and parties. However, rushing away from the experience of being alone can prevent personal transformation. \n14:02 The current situation has taken away our usual distractions and pacifiers. This can be an opportunity for personal growth and transformation if approached with curiosity and an open mind. \n14:30 Don't be in a hurry to escape from experiences that can transform you. Sometimes, the most transformative experiences are the ones we want to run away from. \n14:48 A story about the Dalai Lama's teacher walking towards danger during the Chinese invasion of Tibet illustrates the value of facing difficult situations. First responders also demonstrate this bravery. \n15:17 Approaching difficult and painful emotions with curiosity and an open mind can lead to emotional growth. Compassion and lessons in compassion can be found in this experience. \n15:42 Let's have universal mercy and compassion towards people in solitary confinement. This experience can inspire change in the prison system and empathy towards those who have lost loved ones. \n16:12 There is an opportunity for personal growth during this time, but it requires a whimsical curiosity and a willingness to face challenges head-on. \n16:27 Curiosity is an important mindset to have during this time. Instead of just following passions, it's a chance to dive deep into what you've always wanted to do. \n16:42 In \"Big Magic,\" the author argues that following passion is not always wise. Instead, she suggests following curiosity, as passion and purpose can cause anxiety and pressure. \n16:55 The author wants to replace the concept of passion with curiosity, which is a gentler experience with lower stakes. Curiosity allows you to explore without changing your entire life. \n17:37 Passion and purpose are often seen as everything, but the author believes curiosity is a better approach. Curiosity is a simple, universal experience that doesn't require drastic life changes. \n18:15 Instead of searching for a grand passion or purpose, the author suggests paying attention to the small breadcrumbs of curiosity. Slowing down and being present can reveal new paths. \n18:35 During isolation, many people expected to be productive and creative, but anxiety can hinder progress. The author advises finding moments of silence and reducing external stimuli for a more creative environment. \n19:41 To be creative, isolate yourself from the news. Read the New York Times for 40 minutes each day. Avoid bringing in more news to prevent trauma and maintain focus. \n20:14 Be a good steward of your senses by choosing what you expose yourself to. Decide what you put your senses in front of and be disciplined about it. \n20:24 Gratitude for Liz's calming presence. Questions about managing grief at a large scale. Grief cannot be managed, it must be allowed and felt. \n21:49 Experiencing the loss of a loved one. Surviving grief by allowing yourself to feel it. Metaphor of a monk walking into conflict. Have the courage to face grief head-on. \n22:26 Story of a chaplain delivering bad news. Witnessing people's worst moments. Universal collapse when receiving devastating news. \n23:09 When faced with a devastating loss, the initial wave of grief is intense but short-lived, lasting only about half an hour. Afterward, people start to calm down and think about practical matters like funeral arrangements. \n23:55 After experiencing a traumatic event, humans have a remarkable ability to rebuild their lives. They may still grieve, but they can also make plans and take the next steps forward._ –í—Å–µ –ª—é–±–æ–≤—å –∑–∞–∫–æ–Ω—á–∏–ª–∞—Å—å. –ù–æ–≤–æ–π –Ω–∏–∫–∞–∫–æ–π –Ω–µ –±—É–¥–µ—Ç. –ó—Ä—è —Å–∏–¥–∏—Ç–µ –∂–¥–µ—Ç–µ. –°–æ–±–∏—Ä–∞–π—Ç–µ—Å–≤–æ–∏ –º–∞–Ω–∞—Ç–∫–∏ –∏ –≤–∞–ª–∏—Ç–µ, –≤–∞—à–∏ –ª—é–±–æ–≤–∏ —É–∂–µ —Å–∫–æ—Ä–æ —Å—Ç–∞–Ω—É—Ç –∫–ª—é—à–∫–∞–º–∏, –ø–æ–∫–∞ –≤—ã –∏–≥—Ä–∞–µ—Ç–µ._ Had a abusive run-in with a man with narcissist personality disorder.

I try to fix everything and everyone and I just need to be there for them. Wow_ I got a little gang of teachers or \"gurus\". She is one of them. Smart, intuitive woman. Thank you, Liz. Love from Norway._ i had the opportunity to hear her speak at the Jaipur literary fest and one particular thing that she said literally cured half of my anxiety regarding the future. what she said was (i dont remember the exact word so the gist is..) \"people often face a lot of anxiety and stress because of the notion that everyone has a passion and that is something that they excel at something that will help them fulfill their life's destiny , something that they were fated to do. now here's the thing if you know what your passion is then great but if you dont then dont stress on it too much just ask yourself this - What am i curious about today? what interests me? what do i want to try out today? then act upon the answers and that'll be more than enough\"_ Love does not advise..._ üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª_ 16:55_ This is my second listen. First in mid-April, and now again in July - 5 months into the pandemic. I needed to hear it again, and I came away with different coping tools this time. Always incredibly inspiring and full of love, thank you Elizabeth, Chris and Helen!!!_ That love letter idea is wonderful. I think I'll try that in my journal._ What an extraordinary human being she is . . ._ Mrs. Elizabeth Gilbert,\nI am most grateful for your knowledge and guidance._ I keep watching this! I love it! Elizabeth is so calming and centered._ This saved my life_ When you finish this video, will you actually apply in your life?_ well said liz_ The most memorable part for me is the last 5 minutes when Liz talks about the letters from love and actually reads one out. It blew me away! It‚Äôs changed a lot for me and a practice I have now started ‚ù§Ô∏ècan‚Äôt thank you enough. Liz‚Äôs voice is enough even to make me feel comforted üòäxx_ perfect, dude üëª üçÅ_ A beautiful interview. \" I keep my grain in the belly of my neighbor \" and \" I can only help a few  I cannot help everyone\" \" Do what you can reasonably do \"   indeed. Thank you ..I've been so overwhelmed üòç_ I have one question for Elizabeth and would appreciate if anyone answers it. After 29.20 she says something like this: ‚ÄúTo learn how to be present with yourself means sitting in a lot of terror, sitting in a lot of anxiety, sitting in a lot of fear, sitting in a lot of shame, and being able to allow that without having to resist it, without having to reach outside to numb yourself with.‚Äù \r\nMy question is that all these emotions of terror, anxiety, fear, shame, like all other emotions have physiological consequences. That means that for such a thing to happen ‚Äì to be able to allow those emotions without resisting them - the physiological consequences of these emotions are not ‚Äì at least perceived by the person concerned as - life threatening. Just as there are some level of physical injuries that the body cannot withstand, aren‚Äôt there the level of emotions that cannot be faced? And, is there anything one can do if one faces such strong emotions? Can there possibly be a way out?_ Brilliant_ Just what I needed right now_ This may have saved my life._ Loved this interview, all of it was simply a delight. And they are all so sympatico! That means likeable in italian, but actually it means more, it also encompasses warm, positive, authentic . I also especially liked Chris Anderson and the way he did the Interview, the way he is so authentic and showing his feelings about the subject. There was also such a nice energy within the 3 of them...thank you for that! Was the most helpful thing I have seen about the Corona situation so far..._ I had to listen to this for a school project. I was very stressed that this was an hour long, but I ended up loving it._ Wow. Elizabeth Gilbert is my new hero. Thank you all so much :) xx_ This is fantastic. The complaining is the ego's resistance to being slain; not knowing that as it surrenders it will actually get free. Grief surrenders us to a whole new life which will unplug from ego and liberate like never before._ Please, try to reach out. Theres always hotlines with kind people willing to listen._ I hope you are still choosing life every day. You are important. You are loved. You will get through this. You come from a line of survivors!_ Yes, there are loving, caring persons everywhere who would dearly delight in helping anyone in their hour of need. As a teenager I worked for two telephone help lines. People would call to have someone listen to them. It was beautiful to be part of such a moment of one human connecting to another human. Both sides win.üåà_ That's why I'm here looking for something to save me\nI feel like I've tried so hard_ I feel as though she is speaking to people that have never had any adverse experience in their lives before the pandemic. I suppose there are people like that out there,  but thankfully I am not one of those people._ HOW YOU CAN HELP - support LOCAL food security groups and organizations. They need a database - and local online hubs to better connect and coordinate community resources. www.coolplanetlabs.org_ I hope one I can write a comment that is at least a bit close to your wisdom and eloquence, Liz._ Thank you guys!!  And Elizabeth Gilbert thank you! You are always oppening my life perspective and I love you for that!_ \"the hardest person in the universe to BE with is yourself ...\" so potent. Just that! and walk toward our most painful emotions without resistance - curiosity is the key. Brilliant Liz!_ Great video, very helpful. No doubt Chris Robinson is a lovely man, but did you catch his assumption that Ms. Gilbert lives with other people? Perhaps you didn't, unless you are also entirely alone and more isolated than those who have partners, families, or roommates. It would help a lot if we all could be compassionate and sensitive to difference, if we can._ the letter from Love thingy at the end was very interesting. thanks Liz, i wrote many notes for myself while watching this! (‚óç‚Ä¢·¥ó‚Ä¢‚óç)‚ù§_ 38:50 - \"You never had control, all you have is anxiety... What is happening now is that you are not losing control, you are realizing that you never had it.\" Deep and inspiring._ I love this!! Elizabeth ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è So much wisdom and comfort !_ Thank you for the Letters of Love part. I needed to hear that today._ Because this video was over an hour long I was able to do dishes and enjoy a great time. What an amazing wise woman_ Elizabeth Gilbert...you are brilliant. What a beautiful soul. üíú_ She sounds like Gwyneth Paltrow.,_ One thing I 'resent' (....and this resentment is clearly adding to my current, multi-layered emotional state) is....lots of folks out there... some of my family who live elsewhere...colleagues who live elsewhere... they don't seem to appreciate the experience that people like myself are having, living 1) alone with physical connection to a roommate, family member or mate 2) in a small NYC apartment with no other rooms to give me a 'change of scenery'....no separate 'office' for me to do my work-work on my PC, nor a nice yard to enjoy 3) the very look and feel of my immediate neighborhood is unrecognizable.  (It's one thing to be in lockdown in a small city/town or suburb, where typically when you go outside you see maybe 1-3 people, or a deer or two, and where you have to specifically drive somewhere before you see 'a crowd'.  It's something very different when you live in a densely-populated city like NYC, and when you now go outside, it looks/feels apocalyptic.\n\nAlso consider that....while I get that living with other people while under lockdown, you can get on each other's nerves, at least, in most instances, folks can take a break from each other.  One person can go into another room....upstairs/downstairs...to the yard....take a walk...take a drive.  And then when they want the other's company again, they have it.\n\nBut folks who live alone?  We have no such luxury.  I don't have the option to be alone at times, and with people at other times.  So I really get sick of people (esp people who live with family or a mate) telling some of us that we need to 'quit complaining'.  Yeah, that's easy for you to say...  Also, are we not all entitled to whatever feelings we may have?_ Thank you Liz, for your beautifully profound words. They greatly comforted and inspired me. Off to follow my curiosity now ;)  <3\nThank you  Chris, Helen and TED for all the amazing discussions that give glimmers of hope in these times of shadow and uncertainty._ best thoughts I've herd for this outbreak. How can I translate it into Russian?_ Lost me right at minute 29. ‚ÄúThink of it as a retreat.‚Äù Ugh, I had a visceral negative reaction to her privileged perspective._ Soooo compelling.   Watch til the end, really beautiful and calming.  Thanks üôè_ Anybody gets the Gone Girl woman vibes from hearing this.\nDon't get the wrong idea. I loved it. \nCalm but ready with a plan to survive._ Please bring Ellen Langer . She has done excellent research on how our own mindset can affect our body.\nShe has done research on prejudice and discremenation.\nWhere technology can not reach,\npsychology can reach there._ and about as disconnected with people out of her economic class as she is as well._ Same here._ Elizabeth ‚ÄúGracefilled‚Äù has done it again!_ To me, Elizabeth Gilbert is an unbelievably extraordinary kind of person. Sometimes I wonder, how a person like her exists in these days. Her words are so enchanting & so relaxing & so powerful that I could hear her talk for hours..._ Sitting in my craft room making some things for friends. Perfect way to spend an evening. Thank you for sharing your thoughts._ Thank you so much for sharing this, I found it very soothing, also made me cry. Is the first time I hear her, I will definitely check the other interview you mentioned at the end. Thanks again!_ I would recommend read the last complete Biblical Book ie The Holy Noble Quran and all its translations that guides us through grievous calamities among others, in varying social political and economic issues. There are things that happen that are beyond human power and we have to understand this phenomenum where the powerful divine will prevails and this makes us fully aware by the need to seek faith for His divine protection on earth and hereafter  where protection fails to move into guided track. There will be relief at the end of the tunnel at some stage and somehow .We need to build resilience at all times to remain sane.The way is through submission to the one true God for every breath of our life. Be wise with charity and be thankful.to charity for human help from birth to the grave._ Crushing loneliness is part and parcel of modern living and what is most vital is to have a strong faith in the power of God our Creator. He brought us to Life and He takes us away from Life. Its a matter of time .No human can last forever. Faith is the passion that keep humans going by His giving  mercy and compassion every minite of our Life.  Leave things in the hands of God yet make things move towards comfort in a positive manner.  Read Biblical Books for they give Light in darkness and makes us even stronger and calm in times of corona  grief ._ Too hard questions even for the great Liz. Ask her to send a message to millions of unemployed ... Uf_ Feelings about our feelings IS, sometimes, the biggest challenge._ Wait a minute - did she just say she got her news from the NYTimes? And she¬¥s supposed to a source of wisdom? Really? As it turns out, even a broken clock is still right twice a day._ This is completely useless, empty, hollow conversation.  Just because you have a soothing voice and can make some logical points doesn't mean you are solving anybody's problems. These people are just living in their own bubble, pretending  to feel for the masses and glossing over their insurmountable problems with the B.S. they probably learned at Harvard or Stanford university. \n\nYou are just here to sell your books and nothing else. How empathetic of you!_ Thank you for this...just thank you <3 xxx_ I appreciate this video! Thanks for sharing!_ Thank you for this :) love centered grounded humans!_ Prefer single talk from the person this put me off watching Ted talk_ I chose to mostly help a few people. I have a young coworker who was already in a lot of trouble before Covid. She was facing eviction. I am helping her find a new home, helped by the fact that all evictions are on hold for a good bit of time. I bring her food so she doesn‚Äôt have to go to the store with her five year old. I bring her laundry home so that I can sanitize it (  we are both nurses). Helping her, along with my strong practices of yoga, meditation and sobriety, along with praying for others, sharing food, gloves and masks with neighbors has kept me very calm. \nI only freak out for about five minutes a day, usually in conjunction with my anger at certain leaders. I don‚Äôt post angry rants on Facebook.....I PM one or two good friends and dump an obscenity laced tirade, then I ask them to delete it.\n\nServe, love,give....purify, meditate, realize._ For those complaining abt the length of the vid just change settings to 1.5x. Saves a lot of time._ Thanks Elizabeth, never knew what my passion was and that worried me...not anymore._ This was literally the answer I have been waiting for far longer than this particular crisis. I too have had numerous close loved ones cross over the past decade. I have chosen to retreat into my sacred space and try to get back the inner peace of my I AM self that was broken after 911. After having empathic overload on top of my own personal suffering I finally truly surrendered. After much prayer and meditation especially during the past Holy Days I am once again back on track. Thank you so much for hosting this, for the thoughtful questions and especially to Elizabeth Gilbert in my home state who I cannot thank enough. Much love to everyone üôèüèº‚ù§Ô∏è‚òÆÔ∏è‚ú®üê¨_ Elizabeth Gilbert is as beautiful in person as she is as the author of her books.  There is an underlying spiritual beauty in her writings that you feel as she speaks compassionately about our present experiences. Growth is speaking to us all for ourselves, for others and for our global unity.  Thanks so much Elizabeth._ Thank you so much üôåüôè humbling and inspiring üôè I love the experience of writing a letter each day to myself out of pure love and compassion üíñüôå sending you love and compassion from Carthage in Tunisia üíñüíêüáπüá≥_ Thank you for this interview.

I just hope to see you from a distance next time you come .._ Thank you_ Thank you, Elizabeth, for helping ease the obsession with \"being productive\" and \"being creative.\"  Sometimes we just need to be._ Didn‚Äôt intend to hear the whole thing but could not stop. Thank you from the bottom of my heart, Liz Gilbert! Excellent interview, excellent interviewersüëçüëçüëç_ This video was life-affirming, generous, and powerful. Thank you for the special insights._ Now I'm feeling anxious for having not felt anxious, lol._ Too many useless phrases. Why? It won't help people who were left without job and, as a result, money._ this is the most beautify video so far I have seen, great work from ted_ The diff between quarantine and a retreat is one you have no income  and the other you do and are at ease._ As far as being creative right now, is an idea that is great if we were not feeling stressed and off balance.  It's not like this is a vaca.  It's a looming foreboding._ Hello from Brazil!! Just amazing the way she puts everything to us!!Thank you, all!!!_ So powerful. Thank you._ I feel so close to Elizabeth, even though she is way wiser than me, I feel like we could be great friends, never felt that like that for anyone else before! \nWhat a precious feeling :)_ Thank you, ma'am._ This was just perfect, in tears listening to the letter from love. Thank you TED and Elizabeth._ I think this was really fantastic.  Some wonderful wisdom.  I'd like to add the only thing I feel is missing, which I am discovering when fear, anger and other uncomfortable feelings come up.  Which is how this circumstance brings up our own deepest traumas and issues that we have experienced in our lives.  I am process at deeper levels my own fear from various traumas.  Also feelings of isolation from child hood.  It's amazing to see this time can help us work through them more deeply...and our experiences help us meet this and move through this in better ways.  I'm looking forward to hearing more of these conversations._ Just when I think I can‚Äôt love her any more, she becomes even more lovable. What an exceedingly wise woman who constantly channels the perfect message. Thank you, Liz!_ Oh, hello_ PERFECT love casts OUT ALLfear¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†BIBLE_ This talk is superb.

This mantra gave a place to my pain and transformed it_ THANK YOU 4 this!_ thank you so very much for this important conversation. So sick of the Tyranny of Purpose- life Mission- Stuff.... especially right now...._ in Sweden people are NOT taking this seriously. most people are outside and in malls_ Thank Y‚ù§Ô∏èU All for this! üôèüèª_ Me ha encantado, muy inspirador para reflexionarüôåüòò_ WAY MORE PEOPLE DIE OF TB EVERY YEAR, WHY DIDN'T THEY SHUT THE WORLD DOWN FOR THAT, THIS IS B.S ENFORCING MEDICAL MARTIAL LAW TO USHER IN THE NWO AND TAKE AWAY PEOPLE'S RIGHTS, THIS ISN'T GOING TO FLY AND NO ONE WANTS BILL GATES POISON VACCINES, WE ALL KNOW HE IS ABOUT POPULATION CONTROL!!_ I love Elizabeth Gilbert this was much needed :)_ So grateful for this video, just what a lot of us need to hear right now.

At least English subtitles!_ üëè üëè thank you._ 1:02:19 - WHY did you put this strong sound effect at the end? After listening this good long talk on my headphones, where Elizabeth's voice was quite quiet, you just needed to put this to give listeners heart attack?!_ Ms. Gilbert is a mystic. ‚≠êÔ∏è_ I have enjoyed all of her books.

I appreciate how open she is about her anxiety, allowing us all to feel more comfortable with our human-ness during this time._ Elizabeth is so dope !

During a pandemic? Just more dangerous information, just Fox News for the woo woo crowd.\n\n\nNo thanks!_ I don't think trying to get \"centered\" based upon whom we were, as individuals, a month ago, is an option.  I think we need to take this time to transform/morph into a new being._ How to be an Introvert 101. Ha!!!_ I'm inlove with Elizabeth Gilbert. She is so smart and liberating. This is such a huge help during this time._ How come these ted talks never talk about the bIack sun occuItists that run the show. Never talk about trilateral commission.  Never talk about the registers of these groups like council of foreign relations.  Never talk about how banks center their activities on debts and that destroys counties. Never talk on how people have been turned into corporations legally.\nFake talk for the Order takers._ I appreciate them doing this during this time.

Mine is being annoyed with people who are not their authentic selves.‚úå_ @angarch No, not a burden._ it really is_ Always be kind to yourself.lol._ I can completely relate_ Yes, but how could we have known? Maybe we are simply optimistic and positive people and unfortunatly sometimes the pessimists are right. Also it seemed so much like a movie from early on that I felt like \" come on, this can't be true\"_ haha that was my exact thought!_ üòÇ would say the same but since it is Liz, I was overjoyed_ I feel overwhelmed after seeing 1h long, goodbye_ Yep.

God bless and Godspeed._ Really?? couldn't itbe like 15, or 20 minutes max?_ ‚ÄúWhen you begin to listen inside of yourself, you hear the chaos of your own thinking and begin to feel your discomfort. If you are patient and observe these things without running from them, you will pass through them because they cannot keep you from what lies beyond. What keeps people from being free is not their external circumstances. It is their own mind and their own thoughts. They are prisoners to their thoughts. They cannot stop watching their thoughts. It is as if you were watching a movie on a screen and you could never tear yourself away. The screen then becomes ever more real to you, for you have no contrast. You have no experience to remind you that it is just a movie you are watching. As a result, it has greater and greater impact upon you, and you become a more captive audience with every moment.‚Äù\nA quote from The New Message from God which you can read or listen to at - newmessage.org_ https://youtu.be/kG_8WKBEkpc.

Sleep hygiene (control light, cool down your bedroom, mind the caffeine/alcohol intake)\n1. After bad night sleep do not sleep in, wake up at your usual time (keep regularity of your body's internal clock).\n2. Don't go to bed earlier than usual, even if sleepy.\n3. Resist the urge to nap, especially if you don't sleep well at night (it is like snacking before a meal).\nTips if you are still struggling:\n1. If sleepless in bed for 20-30 minutes - take a break, don't stress yourself. Get out of bed, go do something different, return when you re-learn the association of bed with sleep.\n\"You'll never sit at the dinner table waiting to get hungry\".\nStop trying so hard to fall asleep, because you will teach yourself that bed is the place where you have to toss and turn.\n2. Have a wind down routine. Sleep is not a \"light switch\", but \"landing a plane\": the faster you go, the longer it will take to land. Meditate, take a hot shower (also helps you to cool down your blood).\n3. Remove clock faces from bedroom. Knowing the time won't help you fall asleep, but will only stress you further.\nIf these things don't work you might have an underlying health disorder.

Sleep procrastination - you are sleepy, but think \"I'll just check facebook one last time\", and then 30 minutes later you are already deficient on sleep.\n2.

In fact, there's a wide range of early birds and night owls. Some people function best going to bed at midnight and waking up at 9am, and some function best going to bed at 8pm and waking up at 5am. It's something that you have to figure out yourself by staying attuned to your natural rhythm. Here are some tips to help you do that:\n\n\n- Start dimming the house by 7pm. You don't need to bust out a flashlight to get around; just turn off a couple lights so you know that artificial light is minimally affecting your melatonin production.\n- Note when you first yawn at night. Assuming you aren't sleep deprived, this should give you a better idea of when your body wants to settle down.\n- Think back to long vacations you've taken in the past. When did you naturally fall asleep and wake up? And did you feel refreshed?\n- Don't beat yourself up for being a night owl. If you're a night owl but you insist on waking up at 4am, the idea that it's lazy to wake up later in the day is poisoning the quality of your sleep.\n\n\nHere's a video that might help, too: https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/chronotypes-early-riser-or-night-owl_ 1 hr?

Most nights it allows me to find sleep on a deeper level but even when I don't fall all of the way into sleep, the perfect darkness of the blindfold and the fact that I do not have to focus on keeping my eyes closed tends to keep me in at least a much more relaxed state of mind. There is a big difference from trying to keep my eyes closed, which ends up bringing up it's own stress, and having that perfect darkness blindfold on and being able to just relax my mind._ Everyone,\n\n\n\nLiterally everyone,\n\n\nIncluding me....\n\n\nI swear I will try to sleep early today!üò©üòÇü§™üíúüçÄ_ I haven't slept in 38 hours_ Because.....

That's not what it means bruh._ The people of our country, ever since, experienced discrimination from the way they express themselves. Which is something that shouldn't be normalized. Over the years, our fellow Filipinos, especially the older ones, would call a feminine boy ‚Äúgay‚Äù if he expressed himself to the environment he is living in. This kind of topic is socially relevant to our country who has been religiously based when it comes to things. I think people should start opening their eyes and minds that our country is evolving and people change overtime. \r\n\r\nI think it's interesting that our country‚Äôs ancestors were more diverse than us. People should really be aware that we shouldn‚Äôt judge people for the way they express themselves. It is really revolutionary to think that people could express themselves without thinking what other people might say. For me, being who you really are is a step to success._ What i like in this Ted Talk is the recognition of precolonial Philippines society where we can see the gender diversity and inclusivity just like lenie she is a transgender woman but her community where she lives accept her despite of her being transgender it shows that sometimes we see different in our perspective because we are unfamiliar but if we  become familiar we will learn now to understand it. It challenge the rigid binary concept of gender and shows the importance of understanding and accepting different identities\n\n\nThe social and cultural relevance in Philippine society lies in its recognition and acceptance of gender diversity and inclusivity. The history of precolonial societies in the Philippines, where gender roles were more fluid and women had significant power and autonomy, showcases an alternative understanding of gender beyond the man-woman dichotomy. This cultural heritage challenges the rigid, binary concept of gender and promotes a more inclusive and accepting society. It highlights the importance of understanding and embracing diverse identities, ultimately promoting gender equality and social progress in Philippine society._ i like the Spanish colonization of the Philippines brought with it the imposition of rigid gender roles and the enforcement of Catholic doctrines, which suppressed many indigenous practices, including those related to gender diversity. However, despite colonial influences, elements of pre-colonial gender diversity persisted and adapted over time.\n\nAcknowledging the gender-fluid history of the Philippines is socially and culturally relevant as it promotes inclusivity, human rights, and cultural preservation. By recognizing diverse gender identities, society fosters equality, supports marginalized communities, and enriches cultural representation, contributing to a more inclusive and compassionate society._ I watched a TED Talk by France Villarta about the gender-fluid history of the Philippines. I liked Villarta's speech about the babaylan and how he recognized his own family in the Philippines. However, I disliked that in the context of the babaylan, there were women who were viewed differently by men there.\n\nThe topic is important because it provides knowledge about the Philippines, its culture, and its origins. It also highlights what it means to be Filipino in the provinces. Additionally, the history discussed shows what happened to earlier generations when the Spanish arrived and colonized us. From this colonization, we inherited surnames, language, and other aspects from the Spanish._ The Philippines has a long history of cultural permissiveness and accommodation of gender variance. The speaker, France Villarta, argues that this is an important part of Philippine history that has been forgotten. I like the part when the speaker, Frank Villarta gives the example of the Babaylan, a pre-colonial spiritual role that could be filled by men or women. This challenges the idea that gender is binary and based on biology. \n\nThis is socially and culturally relevant in Philippine society because it challenges the idea that the Philippines is a conservative country. The Philippines is a Catholic country, but Villarta argues that this is a relatively recent development. Before Spanish colonialism, Philippine societies were more accepting of gender variance. This history is important to remember because it can help Filipinos to be more accepting of LGBTQ+ people today._ I liked the part where Frank told them that after all these years, some countries started accepting that the world is more diverse than it seems; they started to realize that their mindset can be reconstructed and gain more from learning learning through each other's differences.\n\nhere in the Philippines, we are in a phase that we're slowly accepting that the Filipino community has variety of colors. Now, I am glad that there are now laws giving acknowledgement to every gender around the nation. Although some are still not addressed, I know that the government is working on bills for everyone to give a just and proper right._ As a Filipino, one point that I like is that we started our culture from our own and it's called the \"babaylan's\" and they started this gender diversity unconsciously and this challenged the traditional gender norms. Our history tells us that we need to reevaluate our current gender norms and that we need to promote more inclusivity because it emphasizes the importance of recognizing diverse gender identities within the Filipino community. It fuels the drive towards building a society that is deeply inclusive and affirming, where everyone is free to express their gender identity without fear or prejudice. Embracing and respecting the fluidity of gender not only honors our past but also propels us towards a future where all individuals are seen, heard, and valued for who they truly are._ The Philippines' gender-fluid history has important social and cultural implications for Filipino society. Here are some crucial elements to help you comprehend its importance:\r\n\r\nThe history of gender fluidity in the Philippines calls into question the standard binary notion of gender as either male or female. It emphasizes tolerance and acceptance of people throughout the gender spectrum by highlighting the existence of multiple gender identities and manifestations that go beyond traditional conventions.\r\n\r\nThe acceptance of gender variance in Philippine culture reflects a long-standing tradition of cultural permissiveness and accommodation of gender differences. This cultural openness demonstrates a historical acceptance of gender diversity, challenging rigid societal norms prevalent in many other cultures.\r\n\r\nThe talk sheds light on the historical context of precolonial Philippine societies, where gender roles were more fluid and egalitarian. It showcases a time when women held significant roles as shamans and community leaders, challenging the Western notion of gender roles and power dynamics.\r\n\r\nThe influence of Spanish colonial rule on gender norms and identities in the Philippines is also highlighted. The talk discusses how Spanish missionaries attempted to enforce a binary view of gender, contrasting with the precolonial acceptance of gender diversity and equality.\r\n\r\nThe discussion on gender fluidity in the Philippines reflects contemporary debates on gender identity and rights globally. It brings attention to the ongoing discussions on gender inclusivity, non-binary identities, and the need for societal acceptance and recognition of diverse gender expressions.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the gender-fluid history of the Philippines holds a significant place in Philippine society by challenging conventional gender norms, highlighting cultural diversity and acceptance, and providing a historical context for understanding the complexities of gender identity and expression in the country._ SOTTO, Kaizen A._1-B BEED_MODULE#4 \n\nI watched France Villarta's TED Talk \"The Gender-fluid History of the Philippines\" that presents an appealing overview of the inclusion of gender that is deeply rooted in Philippine culture. Villarta shows how pre-colonial Philippine civilization recognized and accepted a range of gender identities, challenging the binary perspective of gender that exists in many areas of the world today. \r\n                     Liked: Villarta's research on the role of the \"babaylan\" spiritual leaders and healers who were frequently gender-fluid or identified beyond the male-female binary was particularly interesting. This historical acknowledgment shows a rich cultural legacy in which gender differences were tolerated and even celebrated. Villarta's story is both a cultural love letter and a history lesson, clearly demonstrating how colonial pressures destroyed these inclusive customs. This emphasis on pre-colonial acceptance of gender fluidity offers a positive outlook for recovering these values in modern society.\r\n                       The discussion is highly relevant to today's Philippines in terms of social and cultural issues. The country's present gender dynamics are a combination of traditional norms and modern challenges. While the Philippines is known for having progressive gender-related rules, such as the Magna Carta of Women, cultural views regarding LGBTQ+ people might remain conservative. Villarta's speech reveals a historical precedent for the inclusion of women, providing a culturally relevant foundation for modern movements pushing for gender rights and equality. \r\n                         Overall, France Villarta‚Äôs TED Talk is a strong reminder of Filipino culture's inclusive heritage, as well as a motivation for contemporary efforts to encourage gender equality and respect._ \"learning and working through our differences\" loved it._ I KNEW THAT THIS WOULD NATURALLY LEAD TO THE SHAMANS OR WITCHES OF THE PHILIPPINES IN DURING THAT ERA. YOU CANNOT TALK ABOUT THE PRE COLONIAL PHILIPPINES,  GENDER FLUIDITY, WITHOUT THE MORE SIGNIFICANT WITCH, SHAMANS OF THAT TIME. \n\nAND AS WE ALL KNOW, THE WITCHES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, ARE NATURALLY AKIN, TO THE FEMALE SPECIES. \n\nIT IS ONLY BUT NATURAL, THAT THE MALE SHAMANS, AS HE SAID DESCRIBED AS EFFIMENATES.

But this does not mean that it is widely accepted or practiced. They are oddities who are seen as someone who have super powers meaning.. not normal. Majority of people still adheres to their traditional gender roles.. the father taught his sons his personal trade and how to defend the community and the mother taught their daughters how to take care of the house.\n\nthey did it with the Greeks using the pederasty or the relationships between the male teacher and his student to create the narrative that the this kind of things are widely accepted but other primary sources contradicts this claim.. also the Satyrs which are also unnatural and used to represents negative characteristics were used to support their claim.\n\nthis is the problem whenever presentism kicks in.. forcing modern day concepts in interpreting the past.\n\nSTOP FORCING MODERN DAY CONCEPTS INTO HISTORY!\neven this gender ideology is a form of western cultural imperialism! \nImposing western perspectives in understanding other country's past._ ‚ù§‚ù§_ they were oddities? OUUCHHHHHH MAY GOOOOOOD AAAAAAAAAAHH OOOOH MY GOOOOD_ I agree. They interpret it according to their beliefs and agenda._ Hope the Philippines won't go w0ke. A man is a man, a woman is a woman.

Men are men and women are women._ I cried! thank you so much for this!! thanking our non-colonial ancestors. I thank them for this!_ what a clown ü§ìü§°_ üíó_ He has a valid point but also selfish. I am Filipino. He forgot, what unite the Filipino tribes was the Spanish colonizers. With out that we would be killing each other, taking what is not ours. And the strongest tribes will dominate and continue to dominate other islands to widen their territory. He talks of a small group. He never mention about the Muslim tribes before the Spanish came. The same reason not much was written about them because they could not colonize or influence them. Muslim rule has its issues about sexuality. Instead of blaming the Spanish colonizers._ As Villarta stated, one affects how we see gender is culture, but not all cultures are rigid, and does not see genitals primarily as a standard of our gender. In Philippines, the culture has been influenced by culture of Spanish who colonized Philippines for 333 years who brought Catholicism, but before that in pre-colonial era, woman has a greater power than man in the character of babaylan, and that time the babaylans are not only woman, but there are also man, who are said to be gays. The gays are honored and respected for their capability and flexibility of doing tasks that are both for men and women. The love for gender variants in the pre-Hispanic era was eradicated because of the Spanish friars who taught our ancestors that these male or gay babaylans are demonic and evil, such a misrepresentation that reduced the vibrant identity of male or gay babaylans. \r\nThe dichotomized perception of gender hammered into our heads as social construct, Villarta argued that if this view is constructed then we can reconstruct it again. What Villarta has stated is extremely true, but it is an arduous task for a community or a country like here in the Philippines to change what has been hard-wired in our head for over 500 years since the arrival of Spaniards in our country. The power of religion on the other hand affects our culture and as well as how we see gender. If the highly respected priests and religious figures will be the one to initiate for revival of what the Filipino-catholic ancestors destroyed in terms of the vibrancy of our gender treatment, then there can be a hope for reconstruction of this kind of culture, a culture that promotes homophobia and heterosexism.\r\nVillarta emphasized at the end of his speech that integrity, kindness, and strength of character are far better measure of judgement than race, skin color or even genitals. A strong and powerful statement that if shared to every Filipino will give hope to the reconstruction of our gender misrepresentations and shall give equal treatment across genders. Overall, this video of Villarta about the relationship of culture and gender promotes leaning towards gender equality and gender diversity._ It's quite hilarious how these catholics and christians claim that queer people keep pushing their \"gay\"  and \"western\" agendas down their throats when they themselves have literally killed thousands to push their own beliefs. ü§°_ Don't get it wrong. Our ninunos are not gender fluid. Everybody, stays in their gender. Men stays as men. Women stays as women. The inbetweens stays in the inbetweens. They did not switch around.

Indeed i always wondered what life was like in precolonial philippines. As i write this and worry about the chores i havent done, what were the worries of our ancestors then?

Yes we should teach respect and give people the same rights and fair chances without hate, but we still have to teach something to the kids.  That's what I think is important.  It seems to me the more parents teach their kids about all these different gender and sexual roles (and teach them as normal) the higher likelihood those kids will pick something different._ Even straight Filipino men are more graceful and soft compared to their Western straight counterparts.

The danger and radical side this post modern thinking is you just throw away biology and say gender is a social construct, yes people are PARTLY socially constructed but we are also a biological being and so you just can't change fundamentaly what you are and the post modern way of thinking insist that everythings subjective so you can be what ever you want fundamentaly, and if you think gender & biology is just a social construct that can be changed in your will, then you're also the type of person that would want it so you could restructure it in your own image._ Proud to be a Filipinoüòç_ One of my favorite YouTubers is from the Phillipines and in non-binary, ReddsMess_ This is beautiful and educational.

Thank you._ I wish I could time-travel and try living in the pre-colonial Philippines._ We don't have gender pronouns equivalent to 'he' or 'she,' instead we have the neutral 'siya.' I used to think that my Filipino language was less superior for not having it. Growing up being taught English at school, and then later finding out all European languages have gender pronouns. I thought we should keep up and invent our version of the gender pronouns to keep up with the norm. But now, having a changed view on the matter. I think we had it right all along. I will stick to the all encompassing 'Siya.'_ aren't what he's describing just gender roles? ofc these would differ across different cultures but they are still ways of constructing strict categories of 'man' and 'woman'. and apparently those who don't align to it are then considered a third kind of person? why do we need these categories at all? why can't people no matter who they are behave however they wish without judgement or pressure to change because society doesn't think that's the correct behaviour for who they supposedly are_ The dislikes are coming from hardcore religious transphobic filipinos_ I'm Filipino, now i know why our pronouns are gender neutral\n\n\"Sya\" instead of \"he\" and \"she\"_ I never understood why Western cultures like to be specific about gender especially in their language. French and other Western languages even impose a gender on objects. As a Filipino, we use only one pronoun for everyone, no matter who they are: ‚Äúsiya‚Äù or ‚Äús‚Äôya‚Äù. That‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs that simple.\n\nNo wonder, the Philippines has consistently placed on the Top 10 of most gender equal countries in the world.

XOXO from Philippines!_ Xy Xx_ Although I have met only a small fraction of people born and raised in the Phillipines, I am impressed by their friendly openness and their acceptance of nonconforming human beings.  Perhaps the most amazing aspect of their openness and acceptance of people as they find them is that the 300 years of the pernicious imposition of rigid beliefs by Catholic missionaries seems to have failed in terms of deterring Phillipinos sincere \"love for their neighbors as they love themselves.\". \nUnfortunately, the current President of the Phillipines seems intent on changing these good people from lovers to haters as the means of consolidating his personal power during this time of conflict, in which the Phillipines is caught between US hegemony in the Southern Pacific (South China Sea), and China's rising  challenge against it._ \"Don't break.

An odd point I noticed, though, is while he portrays binary roles as an societal imposition,  he identifies spirits as masculine/feminine and supports this (even historically) by what they do, how they act and the roles they take ... wouldn't this merely be suggesting a different criteria for definitions of masculine/feminine by other societal standards?_ Excellent.

But I understand that people are allowed to behave that way, which is why I keep my negative thoughts to myself. I feel like other people should try and be a little more mindful of how hurtful they can be._ A beautiful recounting of Filipino history. Having grown up there and  later living in the US I never understood the backlash in western culture about pronouns since we generally just use \"they/them\"._ This was such an eye-opener. I've always wanted to learn more about precolonial Philippines. Our schools somehow only give a five-minute introduction about this period and then go straight ahead to our colonial history for ages on end. It's like we never left colonialism at all._ Uh.  There IS no such THING as \"gender fluid\"\n\nYou're born either XX or XY_ I dont see why its important if there are two genders or whatever. If you act \"like a girl\", so what? Or \"like a boy\", so what? How does that make the world better or worse? Maybe I dont see what the fuss is because Im not religious._ you sound  very ignorant_ Inclusive meaning kahit yung ayaw sa lgbt e kasama pa rin?_ Hi, I am born and raised in PH and have lived here all my life. I understand your outsider's perspectives but that is exactly that, outsider. You really have to understand our culture better and what has transpired over the last 30+ years for you to understand why majority of the people picked a populous leader like Duterte. How the western media portrays him lacks context and understanding of what the culture is from the South of the Philippines. People who supports him do not expect him to be perfect but to instill the discipline and political will that's been mostly lacking in so many years and has contributed to a lot of the problems normal Filipinos face on a daily basis. If you ask an ordinary millennial Filipino today who grew up not with privilege but really in as normal individuals taking public transportation and etc. They would tell you safety has increased a lot. The youths of today do not know that. The media writing about the Philippines to the international audience either grew up abroad and or came from privilege and would never understand that local sentiment on the ground. \n\nSometimes, as an outsider like yourself, you have to be careful with applying your lenses of western ideology to a country like the Philippines. Filipinos still continue to be welcoming but also many are waking up from their colonial mentality and have realized that the USA has not really done them any better than just positive propaganda. The country remained poor for many years because of many years of bad economic planning and a very restrictive 1986 constitution. He isn't consolidating power, he is reacting to the US based of his experience with the CIA when he was a Mayor. He isn't a fan of the US and has highlighted the hypocrisy of the US many times and I know, they came out like rants full of curses. But he isn't exactly wrong. We've been a US ally since the US colonized us and yet after the damage of the was that was brought by being allies with the US, we've been left behind among our neighbouring countries. Being allies with the US hasn't really benefit us other than brought us more colonial mentality. There is nothing wrong with seeking other allies like China and Russia who are much more closer. I would rather our country go neutral than pick any sides._ If that's how you see us, please rethink your ideals. We were never a \"lover\" nor was \"hate\" so strong it caused us to loot our neighbors shops.\n\nFrom my perspective the people wanted the change, from ignorant and manipulated to knowledgeable and confident. We are in a transitional state. We used to \"love\" because we didn't know any better, and we \"hate\" because we finally caught up to the schemes and manipulation behind it.\n\nI don't particularly love or hate our current president but one thing is for sure, I respect the fact that he gave a platform and voice to the people who were unheard for a long time. And I despise that violence was one of our most drastic options. He was a spark that made the populace rediscover and redefine our identity even if it meant to disagree with allies that don't have respect for our sovereignty when worst are happening in their own country._ @UCITyZx8j8kDBmCyfRtcotXw \"We all get the discipline part of your argument.\"\n\n-No, you do not, you picked one specific point that I did not even focus on and you dismissed everything else. \n\n\"...but to be absolutely frank, you don't actually need to be a born and raised local to understand what is truly going on here in the Philippines.\"\n\n-Of course you would need to be born and raised here otherwise your perspective would be superficial just like those of Maria Ressa and Heydarian alike, both staunch anti-Duterte who shares mostly negative news about the Philippines to their international audience, both grew up outside of the Philippines, both having western-based mindsets, both hated by many locals. Do you know who labeled Mindanao as a war-torn area? What do you think was the impact on that?\n\n\"This narrative you people keep pushing \"people lack discipline\" is such a backwards statement that doesn't actually zero in on the true problem.Lack of discipline is just the excuse to implement unjust and questionable methods of upholding the law. The true crime here is people like you, who stay blind from unthinkable mistakes and pass it up as \"nobodys perfect\" why dont you keep that same energy to your own people? You are aware of the ongoing corruption here in the philippines, correct?\"\n\n-How convenient for you to accuse me when you yourself are very shortsighted with the whole problem. How much do you really understand the whole picture? How much do you really understand the culture from north to south? How much do you know of the attitudes of the people and how corruption has been enabled from the tiniest things starting from school organizations to Barangays? Those people will eventually carry that to their offices or to the Government agencies they served. Can you say for sure everyone in your clan is never guilty of any minor corruption? Do you think the problems can be fixed by a saintly person? Your idealism is cute but you need more books to read and less self-righteousness. You want to fix corruption? Help the Philippines shift to a parliamentary system where politicians can easily be accountable. Are you doing that?\n\n\"I would assume that corruption within the govt has already been a problem way before you were born. Maybe you should shift your attention from the less fortunate and disadvantaged people to those who are in power.‚Äù\n\n-So, who do you think are the ones who are truly in power? Do you actually know? Have you done your part to really do your research, to dig deeper? Your projection and self-righteousness are really cute.\n\n\"Have you seen the state of public versus private schools? The difference is lightyears. How do we keep children in school when we cannot even prioritize funds to improve the standard of comfort in public schools? Even if public school children get to finish their primary and secondary studies most couldnt even afford to continue in the collegiate level.‚Äù\n\n-Depends on the region. Actually, provincial public schools are performing better than those from NCR. Why do you think that is?\n\n\"So, they work minimum wage jobs that you know damn well cant sustain a household of 2 or more people. So most blame them for not actually succeeding in life given the circumstances they deal with, shouldn't the blame go to the who run and control the system? Not the people.‚Äù \n\n-Nobody is blaming them for not actually succeeding in life and you can not depend on the Government to always spoon-feed you. There are several factors that contribute to the lack of discipline. 1.) The feeling of resignation that one is so little to change the outcome of their situation and their environment, hence the ‚ÄúBahala na\" attitude is rampant. 2.) The colonial mentality that breeds inferiority and a constant desire to be validated by outsiders, so, they focus on looking outside and devalues everything on the inside. 3.) The decades' impact of dumbing down the populace by the media.\nAgain, who really runs the whole system? Do you really know? And do you know why I approved of ABS-CBN‚Äôs contract being discontinued? Why is Vietnam‚Äôs economy gaining speed recently but not ours? \n\n\"No wonder most protesters are \"spoiled rich kids\" and \"snowflakes\" just to be labeled disruptors, terrorists and what not, when they are fighting for the wellbeing of the poor and unfortunate. Gising din.‚Äù\n\n-Yes, most protestors don‚Äôt know any better and a lot of them making noise is just that, making noise, they have not actually changed anything other than band-aid solutions, most of them are actually influenced by NPA ideology, which many from NCR dismiss because again, they don‚Äôt know any better and they don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening on the ground in the provinces with their Manila centric NCR based views/media. And yes, many spoiled rich kids are impressionable, just write an article about a farmer supposedly killed by the army and they believe it when it fact farmer was killed by private armies or NPA themselves. Yes, you don‚Äôt know how much of our media is infiltrated by NPA sympathizers and you do not know the impact of their destabilization on our country for many decades. \n\nActually, the problem here is people like you who like to open your mouth but do not actually take the time to dig deep into the whole systemic problem. \nTake the time to dig deep instead of projecting your frustrations on me. We can agree that we both want the same thing for the Philippines, that we want the poverty gap closed and people to enjoy a great quality of life. There are many things the country needs to fix, first one is security, those rebels need to go, you can‚Äôt educate people when security is always at risk. Our restricted FDI‚Äôs are not allowing more investors to our country. Our Government system is limiting the provinces to improve as they always have to wait for their National budget, hence a Parliament Federal Government would be better for the Philippines to allow provinces to develop their areas and lessen the number of people flocking NCR. And lastly, this colonial mentality needs to go, Filipinos need a strong identity by knowing their true history, not the whitewashed history fed to us by our colonizers or those by NED/CIA or western-based media. That‚Äôs the best way you can uplift people. So, ikaw, gising ka ba tagala?_ @UCYBX4xFue6K_ej16vjSEVuA Well, if your religion constantly tells you that it's a sin and constantly threatens to exclude you from your church community/society and guilts you about it since birth, that would not be surprising. Some people can't handle cognitive dissonance and can't get out of the religious brainwashing. Blame the religion that was forced upon the people, not the people themselves._ @Octavia¬† Maligning me as a white, imperialistic, American is such a sleazy means of not arguing the facts, especially when you are vehemently defending a man who has publicly endorsed the summary execution of suspected or alleged rebels and/or drug dealers - an extreme violation of human rights - is grounds to reject your defense of this murderer in its totality.\nThe absurdity of your ad homenin attack is that I prefaced my criticism  of your President by acknowledging my opposition to American hegemony and in no way criticized China.  \nWhat I did imply is that your President is using the Phillipines' position in-between a rock and a hard place as the means of striking fear in the hearts of Filipino people and the means to consolidate his power.  \nThe irony is that my brief note of more than a year ago was a statement of soldarity with the people of the Philippines in this time of transition and turmoil._ @octavia7408¬† thank you! you've explained exactly why Duterte was chosen by Filipinos. Outsiders will not gonna understand us why we voted for that guy. he may be unorthodox and politically incorrect but he sure get things done, better than Liberals who ran the Philippines for 3 decades without any improvements_ @octavia7408¬† I'm Filipino and I can't possibly believe that you're still defending Duterte's incompetence 6 years in. You have seen how he and our whole government body under his rule ineptly handled the current world event. \n\nI believe that he believes he's a good person. That he's doing what's right in his views. However numerous studies have been shown that the way in which he approaches his policies directly negate scientific consensus. \n\nAnd as per US and Chinese international relations, they're both equally bad. You're naive if you don't think that China and Russia are just as much an Imperialist Colonial powers as the US. The only difference is Neo-liberalism and Fascism. \n\nThe Philippine-US relations has shown how tiresome and broken the capitalistic neoliberal colonial globalization that majority of our society is currently headed toward. \n\nThat doesn't make it mean that us as Filipinos being tired of neoliberal politics must mean we should resort to fascistic styles of government. There is so much more to politics and to governing than simple fascism and neoliberalism. \n\nRead up on Progressive politics, philosophies, and theories by both Filipino authors and other progressive thinkers._ @dawnguinto¬† Oh shut up, you may be Filipino but you see the Philippines with western lenses. And I already know your typical sources of information by the way you think and your choices of words. Yes, I'm judging you because I am so tired of people like you forcing this fascist narrative on the country. You people have been complaining about martial law, freedom of speech and God knows what else, has it happened? Did he extend his Presidency? No. All BS, all fear-mongering without any basis. If the country was fascist as you say, you wouldn't be here on youtube sprouting your typical complaints, your kind won't be able to criticize the Government at all.\n\nYou should be thankful Duterte became our President and choose a neutral stance or else we would have been like Ukraine now. But of course, you will never see that, you can't see past your close-mindedness, you expect one President to solve decades of neglected problems. So shut up because all your talk about incompetence is highly misinformed. There is nothing progressive about what you wrote. It's all trying to be smart without seeing your deep colonial mentality. Why don't you first decolonize your mind and try to see if your concepts apply to the practical field._ @randomly_random_0¬† I don't really like conservative politicians because they don't really bring that much social progress because of the fact that they're \"conservative\" of their colonial culture, but i agree that the liberals who ruled our country never did that much progress (and also social progress.) I'm a liberal and i agree._ Such ignorance from your statement. Duterte and the majority of his followers love the lgbt_ @octavia7408¬† You have exchanged individual freedom and liberty for alleged security.  Even worse, your position could be consrtued as tacit support for what any rational human being would identify as the extrajudical killing of groups identified by the state as the undesirable \"other\"; and, therefore, undeserving of due proces.  \nAs for your allegation that I am an outsider, when debating national security, 99.999% of the populis my Phillipino friend, housemate, and legal associate is in daily visual and voice contact with his family and friends in the Phillipines.  Moreover, as a person trained to ascertain the facts by using multiple reliable sources and reviewing sources that hold the opposite position, I believe his insights into the socioeconomic and political life in the Phillipines mostly correct.\nNevertheless, once a again, I remind you that I wrote my opinion piece more than a year ago and during that period the Philippines has elected the son of the leader who is alleged to have stolen an obscenely large chuck of the Phillipino treasury.\nBy the way, the Phillipines can cast itself as between a rock and a hard place or it can leverage its strategic position into a position of power._ ..Dugyut is the worst or short of saying the Evil President the Phils..have ever had..‚Äã¬†@octavia7408_ ‚Äã¬†@randomly_random_0¬†..Everyone now crying out in heaven..how come dugyut was totally failure with their distorted expectations.._ Yes, although I‚Äôm personally trying to figure out what the difference was. \n\nMy current theory is that masculinity is defined by hunting/fighting and providing immediate needs while femininity is defined by wisdom, spirituality, and making wise decisions about how those resources provided by men should be allocated/used (women were often more trade savvy).\n\nWhat seemed to be praised was flexibility because of our creation myth being bamboo centric (bamboo is flexible; bends but doesn‚Äôt break; it survives the hottest of droughts and harshest of typhoons; it stands proud and tall but when the wind blows it bows down) men and women were created when a giant bird, Bathala, split bamboo. One side emerged man, the other side woman.\nFeminine men were celebrated fs (but I‚Äôd assume the same of masculine women) I assume because they were flexible and had the traits of both genders. \nWhat this video does miss is that male/trans fem babaylan wielded swords even though they didn‚Äôt fight._ It's fluid. It means you can be either masculine, feminine or in between. You can even change the mixture (80% masc and 20% fem) or even change it during your lifetime. In short, it's not rigid._ @WabboGabb0¬† They never said flamboyant gay men were harmful. They said that people are free to have their own opinions and hate something, but shouldn't attack people for it-- verbally or physically.¬†\n\nFor example, I hate exaggerated feminine makeup and long nails. They creep me out and make me uncomfortable. But just because it's not my aesthetic doesn't mean I'm going to start bullying others about it._ @rysingsun4693¬† I have misread the comment above.

His theory is quiiiiiite a stretch. No books, no peer reviews. Take this video with a spoonful of salt._ That would explain why colonial mentality wouldn't stop spreading to next generations......_ @hellobello3153¬† Everything he said, I learned in my college history class and books. I don't know what more evidences do you need when even institutions agree with these facts._ @katsan9155¬† what books? Which institutions? What papets? Were they peer reviewed? He disregarded pretty much all the surrounding tribes with his statements._ Sadly that is the case._ 3:40 that is false infomarion. PRECOLONIAL FILIPINO WERE NOT ANIMALISTIC PLS LEARN MORE ABOUT THE HISTORY. WE ALREADY PRAY TO ABBA IN ENGLISH CALLED FATHER AND THAT IS ACCURATELY WRITTEN BY JOURNALISM CALLED Antonio Pigafetta. THATS WHY IT WAS STATED IT WAS EASY TO INTRODUCE CHATOLIC BCOZ THE TRIBES ALREADY HAVE SIMILARITIES_ precolonial were not animilistic if you want to know more accurate history read Antonio Pigafetta journal._ @EnigmazGuide¬† That is only partly true. Though, precolonial filipinos believe in Abba or Bathala. They still exercise animistic practices._ @davefajardo7037¬† don't forget Apung Sinukuan and Kaptan_ @EnigmazGuide¬† Listen carefully next time before going on a tangent that he didn't even mention. He said \"Animists\" from \"Animism\" or the believe that everything A places, animals, objects, has spirit/spiritual essense or \"breath of life\". His information was not FALSE as our ancestors like many indegenous all over the world practiced Animism. He never mentioned \"Animalistic\"._ Ugh so true the only thing they taught us about pre colonialism are just the art and the Barangay culture_ Honestly, quite true. In schools, the only parts ever being mentioned in the pre colonial times were how filipino traditions on getting married, a lil bit of our mythology and stuff, albularyos and etc. Me and my parents actually thought that filipinos were just people living tribes like it's paleolithic age.

Isip isip naman. Anomalies yang mga sinasabi mo. Oo meron nun pero di ibig sabihin nun e yun ang normal._ It's not a question of making the world better. It's a question of being able to act the way that feels right to you. Surely you have seen what happens to boys who don't act \"like a boy\" and girls who don't act \"like a girl\". They get hurt. A lot. It's a question of the way you act not being arbitrarily limited by your biology._ @sophiejones7727¬† ¬†There are people who believe that girls who act \"like boys\" will somehow make the world worse/destroy society. \"Different\" people do get hurt, what I dont get is why they should be hurt. The usual answer is that God says so but that answer doesnt work for me._ Ryan Carion not really. It‚Äôs not like polytheists or atheists are any better when it comes to gender expectations. They might say it‚Äôs ‚Äúunnatural‚Äù or ‚Äúindecent‚Äù instead: but same difference. Cultures are built on ideas about masculinity and femininity. A religion might either enforce or subvert those ideas, or do neither: that really depends on it‚Äôs relationship to the dominant culture. But that‚Äôs why it offends people. They place value on the cultural status quo being maintained, and subverting gender norms is a threat to that cultural status quo. That is of course ultimately ridiculous because, just like anything else in this world, if a culture doesn‚Äôt change it dies._ It's the fact that people are discriminated and are killed for acting \"like a girl\" or acting \"like a boy\". Talking about this opens awareness that it's not a curse, it's a bad, it's not \"work of the devil\". It has existed alongside with almost all cultures across the world. Talking about it humanizes them. It's not about making them the \"hero\" and make them \"making the world a better place\" it's making the world a safer and better place for them._ WOOT WOOT i love seeing such academic excellence from my people\nA very well-spoken guy üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº_ The way pre-colonial Philippines perceived gender/sexuality sounds a lot like how pre-colonial Native American societies viewed it.

This is among the very best. Universal in scope. Beautiful. Thank you. ‚ù§Ô∏è_ And [We had sent] Lot when he said to his people, \"Do you commit such immorality as no one has preceded you with from among the worlds.\nIndeed, you approach men with desire, instead of women. Rather, you are a transgressing people.\"\nBut the answer of his people was only that they said, \"Evict them from your city! Indeed, they are men who keep themselves pure.\"\nSo We saved him and his family, except for his wife; she was of those who remained [with the evildoers].\nAnd We rained upon them a rain [of stones].

When i google around i found that \"A genderfluid person's identity will change constantly\", isnt that just another way of saying that you evolve by time? If you compare yourself now and in 10 years much can happen right? Like trauma, love and other happenings. Isn't it a bit weird to feel like a girl one day and another you should be a boy again? Isnt that a bit imaginary? Please clear my mind! :)_ Gretchen says hi._ That‚Äôs very informative.

Thank you for this dream Ted talk, France Villarta! ‚ù§Ô∏è_ It is. Up until I conducted my thesis, I didn't know that our ancestors viewed gender very differently than we do today. As someone who identifies as 'bakla' (gay), it's just empowering._ One very important thing that the past europeans destroyed in our culture._ More like same with Thais_ Epal yung Christians._ Every indigenous culture in fact! Before the coming of Christianity the world was a much more tolerant place in regards to genders and sexuality. Religious brainwash and propaganda has made people forget this important human mindset, and tradition. 3rd gender isn't new nor a lefties trend claimed by prejudice conservative religious people, and some cultures had up to 7-8 genders. Others didn't divide by set gender like in western cultures. We used to be shamans, holy people, and the keepers and protectors of culture and traditions._ @kilipaki87oritahiti¬† it's not the religion itself but the people who brought it and used it_ @kilipaki87oritahiti¬† it‚Äôs not Christianity itself. It is the Middle East. Zoroastrianism despite not being related to the abrahamic religions views homosexuality as evil.

Not everyone is required to follow your religious and they have the Constitutional rights not to follow that._ And then Lot offered his virgin daughters to the men in Sodom to be raped so he and his angel visitors will be saved, and impregnated his own daughters afterwards. Disgusting and immoral, right?_ that also isn't what the video refers to, as it is talking about gender on the societal level rather than the individual. The title is a bit confusing. \n\nPersonally I take claims of genderfluidity on a case by case basis. I feel like a person who switches on a daily basis isn't really either of the genders they claim to switch between. Perhaps saying their gender is fluid is easier than saying they are third-gender. Or perhaps they are just confused and need some time to sort things out. But over a period of months or years, I could say your gender possibly switching: much as you might go through a phase of wearing a certain fashion or liking a certain activity. I'm more likely to believe such a claim if the person demonstrates such phase-based behavior elsewhere._ @sophiejones7727¬† intresting point, was thinking about the word genderfluid when i read the thumbnail. I agree that the people who is in this kind of fluid is struggling thought something, rather than fighting against whatever is happening to him/ her at that moment._ When it significantly affects your life or brings harms, then it must be dangerous. Otherwise, such fluidity must be within the rights and prerogative of a person._ @rainb5987¬† 2 yrs later, will read what i wrote üòÇ_ Wow...Filipinos are writing here that they didn't learn it in school. Me neither.\nWhich University is that? Thumbs up to that university._ Create happiness with Olga we did actually, in grade school it was mentioned, and then I learned it in detail during my history class in college. I‚Äôm from the University of the Philippines._ I also read from r/Philippines subreddit that purity wasn't a valued thing for pre-colonial Filipino women. Apparently there was even a job of sorts where a man was tasked to 'get rid' of a woman's vcard if you know what I mean._ Back then, sexual gratification was a mutual goal. Men even had to pierce their genitals to please their partners. Even Miguel de Legazpi noted that Filipinas were treated well by their husbands. You can read more about this in the book written by Luis H. Francia entitled, \"A History of the Philippines: From Indios Bravos to Filipinos.\"_ Women and gays_ @createhappinesswitholga9875¬† Because most of our history teachers only emphasize that our history started in Spanish colonization_ @rainb5987¬† Yup_ @rainb5987¬† Good thing i already have first hand experience meeting a kind of practitioner in real life.

Thanks._ @JohnHlavaty¬† in reference to the talked, he mentioned that the Philippines has no written history not until it was discovered by the Spaniards. Spanish historians  started describing how gender neutral the first settlers in the Island. In Spanish record few male settlers would wear what Spaniards describe as feminine clothing and there are also males who performs female jobs and treated as female individuals. In persuit of colonization, Spaniards started imposing what gender should be in accordance to their norm. So the gender in the Philippines is more likely imposed rather than constructed. \n\nThe infos (historical references) was based from the video._ Sandcastle ‚Ä¢¬† thanks man, glad that see that you proudly identify as a 'sandcastle'_ \"Don't break.

Also 1 percent of the population has a mutation of their DEC2 gene, causing them to not need much sleep practically an still feel fine and feel normal an not tired, unlike the rest of the world who needs 7-8 hours of sleep a night. Does that mean we should totally stop scientists and doctors from suggesting to people that they sleep the recommended amount of hours a night just because 1 percent of the population doesn't follow it? Come on._ @NockyBoober¬† I agree with you, but the two things here are not mutually exclusive -- we can say \"hey, a grand majority of people need 7/8 hours of sleep every night\" and also \"but some people need less hours than that, and that's ok too\"_ @NockyBoober¬† But they're not the only ones, are they Nick?\nThailand had a \"third gender\", as did India.

If I lived in that manner of facts I stated, than, yes! I oils be considered a hypocrite. But I don‚Äôt. When I come across that mentality, I no longer stand and feel the need to debate. I use the opportunity to do what I was shown to do, and that is to just walk away and say a short prayer for them. It‚Äôs called walking in prayer, rather than judgement.

I'm sure there are many things that you \"dislike\" but make no effort to attack, bully, or even have a public opinion about.\n\n\nTrans/homophobia is often the irrational fear that it \"spreads\" like a disease, that acceptance will make it more common. Homophobes, for instance, often claim that children who see it on TV will decide that they can also be homosexual -- though one wonders why this doesn't work with seeing heterosexuality on TV. It's both irrational and a fear._ @Starcrash6984¬† I don't believe that's the case. In their battle (an unfortunate word, but accurate enough) for acceptance they instigate resistance. They don't ask or argue to be accepted, they demand it, sometimes by actual force. They know the reality in which they live, how saturated it is with religion and steeped in close-mindedness. This is not a climate for war, this is a climate for dialog. Not for the rape and pillage of cultural icons as the canvas of their message, but for the display of their virtue through compassion. Think Ghandi, not Geghis Khan. I believe their cause will be much better felt and accepted this way, rather than the unfortunate way they have chosen._ @creatorsremose¬† \"They... demand [acceptance] sometimes by actual force\"?

I'm gay; I'm attracted to guys, I date a guy, and I am one, too. But I'm not particularly effeminate, and I don't see myself as fitting into the stereotype of what a woman is, either. Gender fluid means girls can feel like and act as guys, if they want to, and guys like girls. It's two pretty seperate things, we bunch them up together because it's all a rarer form of how sexuality and gender can be like for different people :)_ That's deep afk_ Part of the story was actually the explanation, why Filipinas are on top 10 or 20(It depends which year) in gender equality.

Hate to break it to ya._ @GhastlyCretin¬† traditions and values are still alive among some, maybe many as a part of their culture. the speaker is one example (sigh)_ @spotlessmind7681¬† Sure, all traditions from the ancient world like child sacrifice are awesome and should be kept alive and considered holy because... old._ @GhastlyCretin¬† off topic_ @spotlessmind7681¬† No it's not._ @GhastlyCretin¬† yes, the difference between taking a life and honoring a life. there is no valid argument for the condemnation of gender fluidity other than (self) imposed beliefs or spiritual impairment._ @spotlessmind7681¬† I'm not condemning anybody. My point is that just because something is ancient doesn't make it great. Most societies back then had horrible traditions and practices that happened alongside the lovely woke ones and it's probably not good to base laws off what people did 600 years ago. The world was absolutely brutal back then._ @GhastlyCretin¬† you're missing the point entirely. it's not great because it's ancient, it's great because the Philippine culture was organically inclusive before Spanish rule_ @spotlessmind7681¬† Lmfao. \"Organically inclusive\". The Philippines was made up of multiple different kingdoms before colonialism. I\"m sure they all loved each other and never had horrible atrocities and wars with each other and totally respected each others ways of life. Unlike the rest of mankind._ @GhastlyCretin¬† again ... off topic_ @spotlessmind7681¬† again... no it isn't._ @GhastlyCretin¬† your unfounded opinion is not valid - NEXT_ @spotlessmind7681¬† Nice cop-out. Next._ GhastlyCretin85  I‚Äôm really curious about ‚Äúchild sacrifice‚Äù you mentioned. Is that something from pre-colonial Philippines? I can‚Äôt remember that being taught in schools.\n\nI do agree about wars between tribes during precolonial Philippines, though. That was why some tribes embraced the Spanish while some fought them._ @GhastlyCretin¬† No child sacrifice during precolonial period in the Philippines._ @spotlessmind7681¬† I agree. History is not an endpoint of argument but it is an important components not to repeat mistakes and improve ourselves. \n\nAs much as we can learn from the past, then we should retain good things while we should not continue the bad things. The content of the video is particularly a good argument against conservative people erasing the existence of lgbt people in history as if we never exist in the history. Again, it is not the endpoint justification of gay rights but just a supporting components. \n\nYour statement about child sacrifice is strawman irrelevant to the topic. Of course, our video pertains to gender equality so obviously the context of comments you were replying pertains to the gender equality only. So, if I am a Christian believing in a bible, does it mean I support to repeat the great floods during Noa's time? No. If I am a Muslim believimg in Quran, does it mean I support the beheading of non believers of Islam as stated in Fatima? No. \n\nAgain, our history is not perfect as it contains both good and bad. If we only show good things or only bad things, then it is biased. History should be shown as \"it is\" and it is up to us whether to learn from it or not.\n\nFor example, Gabriela (Filipino collective feminist group) and UP Babaylan (Filipino LGBT group) supports of bringing back our precolonial views on gender equality as what is explained in the video. Women not necessarily more powerful than men and men more powerful than women but is accomodative of difference, fluidity and uniqueness. Two-gender model is frustrating to a gay man like me because I always have to fight the pressure from other people like homophobia. Some of them asked to marry a girl when I don't even romantically and sexually attracted to girls. Why don't they just leave me alone? Because of patriarchy prevailing over us brought by Spanish colonizers. We need to change that.

Like saying \"pan\" instead of \"panromantic\" or \"pansexual\" or \"panromantic pansexual\". And like, calling myself an \"enby\" sometimes instead of \"nonbinary individual\" every time. So, I could call myself a pan-enby and those familiar with the individual terms would probably piece together what I meant. Though, I doubt I would use that very much, haha.

It‚Äôs been plenty talked about, but most people‚Äôs social programming and senseless lust for flesh and dairy cheeses prevents them to rationalize and seeing the benefits and even necessity in form of this pending pandemic to start eliminating all animal products from their diet, which although a very fast growing number of people (around 1000% to 3000% or so the last few years compared to their previous year), yet that is still a very small percentage of the world population, and predictively not enough growth to avert this possibly cataclysmic pandemic... meaning, it might send humanity back into the stone age, or at least a huge world population of it.

Vaccine work started all over the world. 8, During Jan 15th~Jan 20th China eventually confirmed it's a contagious disease. Many Chinese now believe this can be announced at least 1 week earlier if not 2. Thus the Chinese CDC and Wuhan Health and Medical Committee were heavily scrutinized domestically in China for their slow reaction, especially the latter's possible intent of playing it down and misleading the Chinese CDC. 9, On Jan 23rd, China confirmed the situation was grave and announced the unprecedented lock down of the whole Wuhan city, then the entire Hubei province, one day before the Chinese New Year, causing huge panic all over the country. 10, from late Jan through mid March, China basically locked down the whole country with an iron fist, causing drastic impact to its own economy._ What they gonna do shoot the virus_ Well that's like saying the strongest military force is made redundant by one super intelligent alien species...but I get your point_ Malaria?_ @seanwebb605¬† touche'_ We are also nature.

It's amazing how even in a global pandemic vegetarians and vegans have to show how high their pedestal is._ . history of pandemic. 10 years ago. I'm not a vegan. i eat, breath and think meat. I'm just referring to past pandemic. Thank me later brother. I am no superior. \nWe are stars my friend. What does it mean \"a star is higher than an other\"? It makes no sens. \nYou talk from where you are.\nSo do i.\nAs we uncover who we are, we see we are one.\nFrom there it looks like you got wronged in your past. Big time. That is why you try to be right. \n\nYou are all right to me.\n https://youtu.be/7_ppXSABYLY_ Yeah that's an easy thing to say when there are some geographical locations that rely on imports of food from other countries because what naturally Is cultivated in their own region is not sufficient._ @mahmeme¬† yes. It is easy to say. So sorry. So let us continue as usual and be surprised that things fall off._ @AurelienCarnoy¬† so is your argument strategy just to act enlightened and all knowing so people are put off from continuing the conversation?  you say deforestation is the breading ground of diseases and viruses, since there are thousands of documented and millions of undocumented viruses you should be able to provide... Let's say 5 examples of viruses that have a source tracing back to a forest being cut down. You say mass production of food is another cause for pandemic, so again we'll say 3 sources for pandemics that occurred due to mass production of food. I do however agree that buying local is good, not just for that, but the economy and patriotism as well._ @a1919akelbo¬† i have no strategy. Words come out of my mouth. It is a spontaneous process. Same for you.\nhttps://youtu.be/7_ppXSABYLY\nIt is a nice video on the history of pandemic . Made 10 years ago.\nAs always, i am delighted to talk withe you. Take care._ Embrace the wuhon_ Exactly!

         "This guy is smart af_ Best news I‚Äôve heard all day_ Huh? Make it make sense. Isnt democracy about the decisions of the people and not their intake of information from media? Or, no?_ Here in India every media are focussing on China and Pakistan. No one cares people dying from hunger.  Jai modi ji._ So true. Newspapers are dying everywhere and with it the voice of the people_ Did he just say it's important for the newspaper industry to hold government accountable by having the government fund newspapers?_ This presentation is pure Horse $hit propaganda.  Newspapers are failing because they lie._ This reminds me of the time when The Washington Post introduced the motto \"Democracy Dies in Darkness\" in 2017. Now I see its significance._ Question for All of you thumbs up viewers.  What are you going to do about it?_ I strongly agree with this man and so does that audience. ...... so now what ?_ do you know how i can translate this video to Arabic by my self ?_ Truth has died with democratic MSM  that's the problem._ With thousands of vloggers it's still difficult to find any news sources that aren't agenda-ridden, regurgitated, and unintelligent....just like the mainstream._ I understand the angle the speaker is taking while arguing his way on having tons of news reporter to cover localised news so that people are more well-informed, and thus voting for a more democratic society.\n\nHowever, without any numbers researched (just like almost no research number mentioned in this talk), I will like to question the neutrality of newspaper, and the effectiveness of newspaper as a printed media in this age. Since the rise of citizenship journalism, we began to see more articles & news written online on independent platform, providing viewpoints. Casting aside the question of information falsehood (which the newspaper might also suffer), perhaps the most viral article is the worthy news now?_ The left coast ( y NYC & Chicago) is full-on 1984 doublespeak.   Sheeple nodding heads in unison.  It all sounds so good, makes you feel so good, and that is all that counts~\n\n\nYes, I think the Chuck needs more... rings._ Amazing whatever you want in the region just rely on media_ Condition is even worse in India . All news channels lick boots of ruling party , spreading communal hatred , spreading myths and misbeliefs_ One of the local news in my country bias on politicians that are their friends(elite) they manipulate the audience but I'm thankful my countrymen aren't blind at all, they now get how bias the network is. Unlike before news were rebel in a right way and cooperative in a good way, but from my country that local network were bias and only highlighted the politicians that are in good business with them and can ruin any person or politician that are against to their partnered politicians._ Thank you so much for talking of this argument and your personal story in journalism career._ Great topic, great speech. Thanks_ He is just talking about local journalist musn't die_ Explain_ You want to stop influence of the wealthy and powerfull by getting funds from the government? ü§î_ 666_ whats the difference between making all information taboo except from your political propagandist, and burning books in germany in the 30's?\ngood luck educating trump worshiping terrorists, fascists. fascists dont read, they read between the lines how they are trained, so they can disseminate racial propaganda disguised as anything but. get around hate speech laws and try not to look so much like neo-nazis to the \"normy's\"_ Fundamental misunderstanding about the role of profit in news media.  An interesting prospective, but there are no solutions here._ I'm more concerned with the Republic dying and now that we have a Democracy that destroyed that Republic, the next step is tyranny and we've got that too. So I'd say the Democracy already is dying, so the real question is, when will everybody have enough of the Democracy to tyranny thing? On the talk of Journalist, I don't see any in the Main Stream, there just Corporate employees and they have been for a long, long time now, they all work for nothing more than the PR arm of the Federal Government._ china_ What people don't get about journalism in this comment section is the necessity of speaking truth to power. An ability your youtube and facebook comments don't have. None are influenced by the anonymous web comments. Those in power are influenced by public call outs. That is the power of journalism and the news.l_ Bye bye fake news. The Property demand honesty news. And the People are enjoying the death of fake news._ Our local news to be politically correct will not disclose the race of a violent suspect who just committed a crime._ People know the difference between local news and the mainstream propaganda machine that‚Äôs controlled by the Democratic Party. The People love our President Trump and we demand true news_ \"We need much more than a rebelion,it is time for a revolution!\"\nGod damn right!_ We live in a democracy?_ Available education is confusing and misleading us some time.\nhttps://youtu.be/-elmvsqI394_ In today's time, 90% of news are all fake._ The richest remain standing that is why Bloomberg is the democratic candidate, oh right, he isn't.   If the journalist were non-partisan and covered the news instead of trying to make it, I might still be on their side. When they stopped being on my side and decided they should be telling me what and how to think, I stopped supporting them._ Everyone watching this should be massively insulted. He just said you are incapable of researching political matters and candidates and coming to your own decisions, rather you need to rely on their interpretation, or more likely, their misrepresentation._ \"Local\" news died a very long time ago.\nIt has been replaced by corporate leftist activism._ Can see it happening in Indiaüò≠üò≠. The mainstream news channels r totally biased n support the ruling party be it with fake news or even with steps that results in tanking of the economy üò≠üò≠. \nThere is still hope tho. We have new startups in the media. Those people r not biased towards the opposition or towards the ruling party. I hope we recover n the present news anchors r gone.ü§ûü§û_ When fake news dies and you fools are held accountable table... that's when freedom and democracy will return._ Journalist are overrated. Become a writer instead. Most journalist are lazy they don‚Äôt go find out what‚Äôs actually happening. They start with an opinion, usually globalist socialist types. So all the prizes & awards are meaningless, too many fake news articles made journalist expendable. Social media has made newspapers disposable. Notice he mentions Trump & Schultz but not Bloomberg! Bias! We see through you guys, so called ‚Äújournalist.‚Äù You want a propaganda paper funded by tax payers as you spew your bias, NO!_ You know what the government call revolutionaries? Terrorists.\n\nUnless you're willing to live with that label and all it entails, just keep keep going to work, get married, have some kids, pay your taxes, pay your bills, watch your TV, follow fashion, act normal, obey the law, and repeat after me: I am free_ Our darling Media as a whole deserves some massive punishment._ It is lies_ a lot of people here are say that the News are corrupted. I only hope you don`t get to the same level as Brazil. Here people who support the president are nuts, everyone, incluided the News are communist. Everyone is a lier, except him. He got elected because people started no to beliave in real jornalism, but on youtuber on the internet._ X_ Nice april fools video_ Local news. Like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fHfgU8oMSo\nNo thanks. Nice try tho :)_ The MSM are 95% left-wing activists._ Learn to code_ 1 we have NEVER been a democracy and 2 when the news decided agenda pushing was more important than informing citizens, they signed their own death warrant. You fools did this to yourselves and now you want to whine and thrash about as you die from self-inflicted wounds. \n\nYou can salvage something, but you have to cut the BS. But since we all know you won't, we'll just continue to watch you go down in flames._ When local news dies, so does any other_ main steam is biased af. Any system which relies on clicks and views to have a revenue will either provide what the audience wants or click bait._ People it's not capitalism that's the problem. Its corrupt governments and large corporations that have taken away the rights of the masses. Only they are allowed to trade and make profits, the masses have to be their slaves. By one deception or another they take away the little man's right to trade, they implement rules, regulations,  taxes etc to make it impossible for people to have their own business and profit. With their schemes and plots they monopolise the market \n\nWith foot and mouth disease hoax they bankrupted most of the small farmers. \nNow with coronavirus a very large number of small businesses will go bankrupt. \nThis is not honest capitalism. There is no more democracy._ news is not needed. We have the internet_ all mainstream media needs to die lol we got twitter we're good haha_ Who‚Äôs picking these new journalists?_ ... and then Chuck Plunkett mysteriously went missing..._ If the msm doesn‚Äôt want to die, it should stop killin itself_ Who cares_ The level of self importance is astonishing... Local news has been dead for years, and democracy a lot longer than that!_ This was exactly my most recent essay i wrote for college english_ He is wrong, and his political affiliation is a large part of it._ FAKE NEWS IS ALLOWED TO CONTINUE THEN DEMOCRACY IS ... \n\nWhy isn‚Äôt TED talking about the deep state_ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtOtKNcscWY_ If people cared about local news, revuenues would come from local news. But everybody is interested in the big stories from the big world. \nüëá\nAnd right now everybody from all around the world is listening to a TED Talk in America, by you, Sir !! Not local at all.\n\nWe all reach out: every TED-watcher exactly now is not consuming local news at all. Not good ü§®\n\nSo don‚Äòt blame the bad business guys üíµ, blame yourself for talking to the whole world on YouTube and doing exactly what you are condemning. \n\nEverybody here is searching the web for World-News AND NOT spending on local stuff, not caring at all, but clapping and blaming ‚Äûthe big corporations‚Äú. We good them bad!\n\nNobody will stop you from producing local news... exception made for the locals. They don‚Äôt care anymore.\n\nBut people üëè üëè when they here public funds, rebellion and REVOLUTION ü•≥ , that‚Äôs quite scary._ Yeah buddy Andrew Yang said this and no one cared..._ Media is a disgrace to go along with this covid-19 bs._ The traditional method of news is dead and has been for some time. This is why they are all fomenting fear to the nth degree regarding covid19... starved for clicks, reads and eyeballs they have found s boogeyman that makes them very 'necessary' to the masses and, acting in their own self interest, they have taken full advantage of that. \nThere is no honor in saving a dying industry and no honor in democracy._ I hope democracy dies. Our founders did not want a democracy. I want my Constitutional Republic back._ When government agencies stop adhering to the United States Constitution democracy dies._ Excellent presentation. Spot on from someone who knows because he has been there -- not just some egghead academic that never held a real \"local\" job. Way to go, Chuck Plunkett._ Well unfortunately this is one of the big issues with the capitalism_ H_ We are an army of digital warriors now. The media has been dead for 40 + years. If the media told the truth it would be thriving because the avg. American wants the truth... irregardless if your an elephant or an a$$. Same thing with MSM TV and universities by and large ... propaganda mills._ We have never had nor desired a Democracy. We are founded on a Republic.\n\nWe, the People, are the new Media._ Capitalist Monopoly on news has killed the local news. Or do you think that the Sinclair buyouts don't matter?_ George Washington was one of the wealthiest Americans.  This is garbage._ when obvious opinions and biases are disguised as \"news\" and shown to the masses, that's when news dies._ Well.. the west no longer has democracy_ 5:36 nice star wars reference_ Democracy dies when the msm sells out to China during Coronavirus_ And dedicated journalists can and do call attention, as much as they are capable, of citizens to demand government and politicians remain faithful to the Constitution.\n\nAnd then there's Fox News Channel which subverts that effort._ Quiet someone might actually believe it!_ True. Democracy would imply that people hold any power at all in jurisdiction. They don't. Once they have cast their vote they give away all the power they have to representatives, deciding their fate for them. Democracy is not the ability to vote._ Truth in journalism died a looong time ago!_ Local news has been dead for years, that's why we see a shrinking in our democracy. Local news gets all of their talking points from Media Matters and other centralized authoritarian leftist outfits. That's why you can watch hundreds of videos on YouTube of local news channels from around the country, parakeeting the \"exact same words\" when they are presenting their news stories._ This is the situation of every developed and developing countries.. I am from India and you made me feel what is happening here.. \nI feel so sorry that news is dying before cheap entertainment_ Wow, UNBELIEVABLE nonsense! This guy still doesn‚Äôt know why media is going down. They all deserve to lose their JOBS. Answer to your question:  You lost your job because you don‚Äôt report real news anymore! \r\nStart reporting instead of writing propaganda and people will read it. Yes, it is that simple!_ Dear Ted, please stop with these political videos about how society is failing.  Ted Talks used to be about creative ideas, revolutionary technology and beautiful design.  Long ago, every Ted Talk I watched had me thinking \"Wow! The world is a beautiful place.\" Now, every video makes me think, \"Wow, society is falling apart.\" If I wanted to hear that then I might as watch the news..._ thats ironic...i thought the media thats full of communist sympathizers spewing communist propaganda and sowing discord among the populace is the threat to democracy....oh thats it....u must be stating democratic in the same manner as east germany was called the german democratic republic and peoples democratic republic of n korea....thats the democracy u speak of_ Please, stop all the hatred for people of other countries or ethnicities, we see how the governments around the world function and at the bottom of our hearts we all know that there isn't a best one but there is one that each person recognize the most, that's enough for us to live a fulfilling life, right? We are only human beings with limited knowledge about the world, there are so many things we cannot understand. That's why we really need to learn to be humble and open-minded so that we can become a cohesive group to live with the Earth._ We don't live in a Democracy. <---period \nWe live in a Constitutional Republic. \nThroughout history collectivism is, and always has been, wrong. We are all equal, not the masses/majority. Quit hiding behind crowds and stand up for yourselves. Love your neighbor as yourself and stop subjugating others through your ideology of \"mob rules\". You came into this world with nothing and that's how you'll leave. May you know the Truth and may He set you free. \n\n(filthyrags, 2020)_ Most media is just communist propaganda criticizing free speech._ Media can survive, but not by printing news on paper. Newsprint is dead._ Andrew Yang had been saying this_ The answer is not going to be government funding. State funded news is propaganda and if you think it is bad now wait until you see a paper that only covers incumbent officials and proposals that expand government exclusively._ It's called YouTube and the intellectual dark web... News is ALWAYS biased._ 6:10 who thinks he's correct_ About halfway through I saw where this was going. He starts off by saying that the jib of  local news was to filter information to tell the stupid people what to think. Then he goes on to say that it turns out that such ridiculous behavior is not profitable when people are given access to more balanced news nationally. So then the solution is to have the government run the local news. Really? You've got to be kidding me!? When I find a way to make a local news balanced and profitable? That's the solution._ when local news dies so does propaganda_ Everyone is on-line...thank you Steve Jobs...Wozniak...\nGates... et al_ Local media IS ALREADY DEAD,  forced by dictates of major networks, they focus on weather and sports. Nothing useful but spr is ad the fake news of ABC, NBC and others. Simply political shills, mock sympathy and not journalism._ Yes but what are you doing to ensure that local news is accurate and also respecting the people and not the benefit of only the news station newscasters and corporations?\n At this rate it's better to establish that and Proclaim that you are worthwhile and on the side of the people because the stigmas. Apply to I saw apply to the news without prejudice as well.\n What is your opinion on that and how should that be dealt with and can you endorse any news entities yourself based on what I have explained?_ When the masses know it's fake but have no idea how to stop it, they tend to just follow it as if it's gonna work somehow and none of them don't need to be responsible for what they do, until the entity collapses._ Note that it was pretty well off with multiple competing small outlets though. If you could get a scoop that X big outlet was lying about something, you'd publish to make a buck._ I'm pretty sure it was the other way around: their sales went down first, then they looked for alternative business models, and went for more sponsored content and ads._ And, to this gentlemans credit, He's probably been saying it longer. Part of what I like about Yang: he really listened for smart causes._ A good way to discover biases is to compare them with alternative sources. News is still important in that regard._ He did not say government should run the local news. He says it should be funded, so media corps don't have an incentive to chase profits and publish whatever the biggest bidder wants them to._ He said it's time to debate a public funding option. It's possible to create a non profit organization to do just that. But it does sound like he wants the government to pay for it as well...hmmm very tricky this guy._ Pretty sure the speaker agrees with you - and hence wants a big change to fix this?_ It is no exaggeration to say that democracy has become a religion; a modern secular religion. You could call it the largest faith on earth. All but eleven countries- Myanmar, Swaziland, the Vatican and some Arab nations - claim to be democracies, even if only in name. This belief in the God of democracy is closely linked to the worship of the national democratic state that arose in the course of the 19th century. God and the Church were replaced with the State as society's Holy Father. Democratic elections are the ritual by which we pray to the State for employment, shelter, health, security, education. We have absolute faith in the Democratic State. We believe He can take care of everything. He is the rewarder, the judge, the all-knowing, the almighty. We even expect Him to solve all our personal and social problems. \n-Beyond Democracy_ Traditional media was too late to take notice of the tech industry + social media platforms becoming their biggest competitors. Local newsüì∞ is an important service but some kind of disruptive innovation needs to take place if they want to avoid being swallowed up by the media giants and big tech._ ALL MAIN STREAM MEDIA IS SOLD OUT PROPAGANDA!_ My local news has been dead for years because it is owned by Sinclair, which is right wing propaganda trash._ Media sells but who's buying? Chinese, Democrats?_ Well internet has not only badly effected print media and reduced news rooms and number of journalists\nBut now it has now closed the whole world and confined us to our rooms due to Corona spread_ When was this recorded? It's at least 20 years to late._ The news should be restricted by law to tell the truth, yes i know this can be used against the news if they mess up but if they later correct them selfs. (Edit) Ok so apparently there is a law that is like this, tho we as the people would have to sue them. So aka thats impossible especially for the lower to middle class citizen. Cuz you know armys of lawers are a thing._ liberal fake news, TED has become the Democrats talking platform. #FakeNews #Trump2020_ Just reading the title you realise this guy doesn't know the first thing he's talking about. There are 3 simple tests to know whether a democracy exists at all, let alone whether its dying, and local news isn't even in the frame. I have news for him no polity passes those 3 tests that's why the idea of democracy is a figment of our (and his) imagination yet to emerge as a reality._ No wonder now most media are just full of agenda üò¢ Full of partial, misleading truths... and twisted stories..._ Nice topic_ Except if its fox news. When fox news dies, the world is a better place_ Thanks sir_ No thanks! Local news is just as tainted. Follow the money folks_ fake news_ If it means shutting them up..._ The media is trash_ I agree._ And Chuck didn't say a word about it and how big Media give the people a selection, not an election, every four years üëé_ That is just idiotic. Not everything is untrue, learn to tell the difference through critical thinking...\nWhy are Americans so damn terrified of nuance?_ Well said it's all ready started 5G going up every where killing people_ If you paid attentin to the video before commenting, you would have heard he mentioned 2012 Aurora theater shooting. So its not 20 years ago._ I know that they reported on it. That is not when it was recorded. My comments was this is 20 years to late not that it was recorded 20 years ago._ That would not, and cannot, come to pass. Who know exactly who would define what is 'true', we have China as a perfect example of why that's a bad idea._ @ALovelyBunchOfDragonballz¬† hey its already a thing its just impossible to actually successfully enact this law on a big news industry._ @patwick7351¬† no, we have laws making it illegal (in a way) to lie, we do not force them to tell the truth. Wording, here, is critical._ @ALovelyBunchOfDragonballz¬† well then. Now im in a mood for purging_ I Strongly Agree with you_ This is one of the more frustrating liberal hypocrisies. Fox News is corrupt but CNN is credible journalism, as if the station is not obligated to please its shareholders._ Naw all news companies must be torn down and rebuilt. Every side lies. But every side has some form of truth._ Not all local news are follow the money, (most) mainstream media are. Propaganda (specifically tug-of-war propaganda) are everywhere, even independent and alternate media are tainted too._ It just yellow journalism, nothing else."

         "This is great talk. However, the majority of people on Earth are narcissistically wounded and severed from Soul, G-d, Nature, and others. We can't expect people to act with empathy and compassion as all Life dies out. People will regress. The right wingers are fear based and are the most wounded people. They will gang up, form militias, and try to take what little everyone else has. That's why we are collapsing; because humans lost their way and became alienated from and disconnected from Nature._ ok, then what do we do? lol_ Turn off your media. That‚Äôs how._ This is the stupidest thing I ever heard.\nPeople who are are afraid this need to do there research it‚Äôs not true._ the fake climate crisis is an anti human agenda funded by billionaire's who fly around in jets own many many massive houses go on many many holidays drive massive cars , use huge amounts of resources, these same billionaire's lecture and attack poor or less well off people for using what the need to survive and live in the modern world eg cars heating you home , co2 is plant food co2 is part of the cycle of life, co2 does not global warming, zero carbon is a zero life agenda_ Dr. Lertzman had requested a review copy of my book that goes into depth about climate emotions and managing and leveraging them for action. I sent her a signed copy. She was so unreasonably critical and unsupportive of my work I was very hurt and didn't even respond to her last message to me; it was condemning and hypocritical‚Äîironically, just the way she describes the \"bad therapist\" in this talk, eeks. She offered zero \"attunement\" to my work or to me, just condemnation for not mentioning her in it, and making a bunch of assumptions about what my book was about. My work went on to win a first place award in environmental and social justice. Ironically, my work gives tons of holistic and evidence-based tips on how to maintain work with and leverage painful emotions into care-in-action.\n\nRe this talk: she doesn't say the word \"anxiety\" once in the talk and gives no real tips on how to turn anxiety into action. She merely recommends breathing and attuning to ourselves and others to exist in a window of tolerance to face the crisis. If people are too afraid and overwhelmed with feeling badly, let's discuss comprehensive means to work with our collective and individual trauma and raising what I call our \"fear mark\"‚Äîour ability to face what is scary, which looks like learning to tolerate distress so we can exercise care instead of shutting down. I wish you well, Rene, but try to walk your talk._ This is just the sort of video which contributes to anxiety. People may suffer from weather events all over the world but they always have.  The difference now is main stream media and the alarmist message. Without this people would adapt (or die) again nothing new. To add eco anxiety to the practical adaption to this unstable world just creates problems. The UN summary of the IPCC reports is alarmist and does not reflect the reports themselves._ Thank you Renee, this is so important.  You connect the fundamentals so well.

Species have not extincted yet in recent times._ Why are these people trying to promote fear?_ I'm looking forward to longer summers, milder winters, lower heating bills and a shorter drive to the beach._ We gonna talk about all the burning cars and tires caused by the riots last year in the US over nothing?

This is important. and all humanity will suffer... including the innocents who've been advocating for the environment._ @sejucreampie9246¬† Relax. Climate is climate. When I was a kid, it snowed, it rained, it was windy, we had hurricanes, we had T-storms, we had blizzards, we had heat waves, we had cold waves.  It's the same stuff that goes on today.  Principle of uniformitariasm.

It seems like you dont get the speaker's point... anyways, it is no use to argue, I hope you look at the news about the scientists..._ @sejucreampie9246¬† No Mr. Bot, most animals did not go extinct b/c of us.  All the extinctions from the Cambrian, Devonian, Permian Periods were due to survival of the fittest.  Science is a process; not a static body of knowledge. They simply have disagreement on issues.  Hurricanes have been tracked for a long time in this country--they are created in nature, not by CO2.  Most wildfires are incited by lightning strikes esp at altitude but also sloppy maintenance of power lines or earthquakes rupturing such lines.  Human carelessness or arson does contribute some.  But that is not the reason to change society upside down. It means follow Smokey the Bear's advice.  In case you didn't know, CO2 is a component in fire extinguishers, specifically to put out electric fires.  See CO2 quells the fuel source._ you got a point and it seems like you're smarter than the environmental scientists out there. I think that you'll never change your views about this. oh well...._ @sejucreampie9246¬† I have a masters in earth science.  Earth science is about science. Environmentalism is about narrative._ If it's okay to you, I genuinely want to know what your thoughts are in the news ( I think you already know what that is since its trending)._ @sejucreampie9246¬† The news today is irrelevant b/c they don't report. They dictate narratives with a set of talking points. They do not understand how scientific method works.  They are applying some of the 10 fallacies of logic in order to persuade people. They are anti-capitalist, anti-democracy & are convinced that a centralized approach would somehow solve all the world's problems & satisfy this thirst for social justice. But they are not God._ @kimlibera663¬† having a master doesn‚Äôt make you more prepared or more intelligent. If you say these things you are probably lying about your degree_ @chiara7424¬† Oh you're bitter b/c I have a brain & you don't. This is my field idiot. Just because I like many other people have a different opinion does not mean I'm lying. It's the alarmists trying to manipulate all._ Enviromentalism is a cult. Earth science is real science (astronomy, meteorology, geology, oceanology). Enviros suffer from the same egoism as Trump-that only their presence fixes the problem. What they really need to do is sit thru some earth science courses._ @kimlibera663¬† sweetie if all the most important scientists in the world are preoccupied about the situation and future outcomes, maybe you are the one who should sit through their conferences. You will see the results for yourself, but please don‚Äôt lie about your master. If you had a master you wouldn‚Äôt say this kind of bullshit. Do you know anything about the effects of permafrost melting? The effects of heat on bees and consequently the agricolture? The lack of water? The increasing intensity of storms? It‚Äôs impossible for me to believe you know anything about science other than some conspiration theories_ @chiara7424¬† Not everyone agrees with you Chiara. I have sat thru conferences.  Do your talking points always include ad hominem.  Ma'am Co2 does not cause any kind of storm.  Everything is alarm & this is what the critics say about greens is everything is doom & gloom because you don't like fossil fuels. People like you make their livelihood off doom & gloom. We on the other side just understand the deficiencies of the grid. Everyone is for cleaning up physical debris & reforesting & employing more biological controls for retarding insect plagues. I'm very supportive of carbon capture because it works. The thing is none of you can have a rational conversation because you have not had courses in earth science to know how weather works.  BTW I am a beekeeper & the decimation of the bees are due to 2 things-varroa & pesticide use.  Now one of my subspecialties is hazard mitigation in order to reduce human mortality & property damage. I do it in realistic way. You cannot think you're God & can prevent every single bad thing. But you don't know any of the factors that are prereqs to form a hurricane._ @kimlibera663¬† ok fortunately you are the rare gem that will save us all. Come back in 10 yearsüôÉ_ @chiara7424¬† And all you people think you're God._ Yes, burning cars, riots, and property damage aren't great things, but talking about that overshadows elephant in the room, which is the burning of fossil fuels._ @youtubewatcher1555¬† It overshadows it because it‚Äôs worse. We have to fix internal problems before we can save the world._ @billystink4611¬† Sorry, I'm not sure I understand. Can you explain further?_ @youtubewatcher1555¬† No I don‚Äôt think I can explain it any simpler, sorry. I‚Äôm not good at explaining things._ @billystink4611¬† oh no worries. I was wondering because from the EPA electricity production (25%) and transportation (29%) together generate most of the emissions in the US, so I was curious to hear your perspective._ Try California here in winter 2022 with no cold temps and no clouds and no rain.  Nothing but hot burning sun and hot burning winds.  üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠_ @ryanfresh8521¬† lol. California has been a semi arid desert for over 10,000 years. That‚Äôs WHY you like it. There‚Äôs no rain. Until El Ni√±o. Then they moan it‚Äôs climate change. üòÅ_ As a Brazilian too, she is explaining exactly about it. It's not about being positively delusional, but to learn how to deal with our emotions in the present moment to act more intentionally._ I live in California and it‚Äôs getting hotter and drier and we no longer have seasons anymore.  Just fires and heatwaves.  And hot winds.  üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠.  This problem is corroding my life._ @ryanfresh8521¬† I'm not in Cali, but that's terrible to hear. All of this feels like that movie \"Don't Look Up\". I'm having trouble accepting the fact that people are this ignorant about the most important crisis of all._ Do you not realize to achieve \"rapid changes in all aspects of society\" will require that every nation on earth be handed over to Tyrants that will have to be so ruthless they will make Stalin look like a school yard bully. To move everyone out of their energy consuming homes and seize all piston vehicles to reduce co2 emissions will require the outlawing of private property -- and the ruthless enforcing of the law. In turn, this will require strong government response against the inevitable guerilla style civil wars the tyrannical actions will require.  A hundred million armed guerillas with more ammo than all the armies of the world will stand up in the U.S. alone. Once the civil wars are over, the recalcitrant nations will then have to be attacked to force their subjection to the methods necessary for climate-change mitigation. Five of those recalcitrant nations will resist with their nuclear arsenals. So, after years of guerilla wars, international wars of aggression, including nuclear exchanges and the horrendous death of a couple of billion people, the Tyrants will be able to engage in their purpose of climate-change mitigation. The only problem is your tipping point, in which mankind has time to stem your asserted catastrophic climate-change, will be long past.\n\nI know all you tyrants at heart do not want my input, but I am going to stick it in your craw anyway. \n\nFirst: You are not going to come close to meeting your deadline. \n\nSecond: This means the best thing the world can do about mitigating climate-change is N-O-T-H-I-N-G. \n\nThird: This is because we will be far better off if we respond to the climate disaster that comes upon us than trying to avoid the disaster the way you want us to try to avoid the disaster -- if it comes, all of your tyrannical efforts will be for nothing -- and many will have died at the hands of the Tyrants. \n\nAll of the trillions that will be spent after the disasters are upon us will be put to much more useful projects than can possibly be done ahead of time.  No central planners can foresee the real needs that will arise in the future.  Instead, the central planners  will squander trillions on useless projects creating disasters of their own.\n\nFourth: The attempt at avoiding the disaster will be far worse than responding to the disaster once it is sweeping over us. This is the only winning scenario. \n\nOn reason, is the science scenario guarantees war around the world. Scientists have no understanding of how to manage social matters in the first place. These people have no understanding of the magnitude of their demands. The world would be far better off free, with every current port city under two hundred feet of water, than to endure the Tyrant wars your \"scientific\" mitigation methods will cause. \n\nFifth: It is entirely wrong for you \"science Tyrants\" to believe politicians should act now because of a \"consensus among scientists\". \n\nPoliticians must listen to the consensus of their constituents, which is a much larger constituency than scientist. This is not wrong for politicians to do. Besides if they do otherwise, they will be voted out of office. The politicians also have the added problem of having scientists telling them face to face on a regular basis that there is no true scientific consensus. So, who are they to believe? \n\nSixth:  You scientific Tyrants are as terrifying to many of us as German scientists were in the '30s. Besides, you have no more respect for us than those German scientists did. So, why should we let you potential criminals have your way about anything that is going to impact on our lives and families so catastrophically? \n\nCan you science Tyrants not see that your mitigation demands will be more catastrophic to the general population of the U.S. than World War I and World War II combined? Everyone in the world will have to give up the idea of freedom and of personal goals, and family goals, to meet your demands and submit to the necessary Tyrants that must rise over all the nations. In turn, those tyrants will have to enslave much of the population to achieve their world changing goals. \n\nSeventh: My response is that I would by far rather live free and respond to the predicted environmental disasters as they actually present, than to give up everything to tyrants that will have to be ruthless enough to destroy everything my family has worked for all of our lives. Do not say I am being selfish. You are the ones being selfish, because you are the tyrants pressing controlling demands on everyone else.\n\nFor our family‚Äôs sake, we must stand and Live Free or Die. \n\nI by far had rather die living free than live under the guns of tyrants. Ten million of us who are veterans are still able to use our weapons and once you are a veteran, you do not forget what you have been trained and conditioned to do. We have been trained to kill every tyrant that tries to kill us, or families or our freedoms. \n\nFurthermore, for you scientist tyrants to attack the security of our families is nothing less than a declaration of war on all Americans -- and every nation on earth._ Thank you for taking about this very important topic Renee. Climate anxiety is valid._ In desperate times, desperation is a \"valid\" response. \nSadly we need to push through the despair somehow._ This actually makes a lot of sense. People are ignoring the situation because they can't deal with it mentally, I've done it myself._ Thank you so much for talking of this argument. I can‚Äôt save the world, but, as human I give small contribution by living a simple life here in the top of the mountain of Trentino Italy.  I cultivate and produce most of my nutrients. I travel using public transport, and above all, I always use good sense of living._ Covid19 is God's way of saying OK BOOMER to the climate change deniers.  Eliminating BOOMERS will solve so many problems caused by the STUPIDEST, MOST DESTRUCTIVE  GENERATION EVER.\nIgnorance is not knowing, Stupidity is denying facts, evidence, truth, morals, responsibility, science, ad infinitum_ Available education is confusing and misleading us some time.\nhttps://youtu.be/-elmvsqI394_ Always such great content! I am new Youtuber who has anxiety due to her hubby just being laid off with this virus going around! Would love support!_ screw the false government... eat less meat, lower energy usage, don't buy crap you don't need, when you need stuff buy used, buy cheap used EV, solar, smart thermostat, led bulbs. Regardless of your income some of these actions are doable. We've lowered our co2 emissions over 5 tons in 3 years._ Can somebody answer this for me? Is this a Ted Turner channel, and if not who, or what is Ted? LOL_ This virus actually could show that we are or aren't causing climate change conclusively. The amount of pollution based on the destruction of our industries is going to plummet._ Listen now people_ How bout climate change now? 32% unemployment coming.

My white grandmother had ten kids and lost a leg.

Unbelievable they were privileged.  We are not smart people so we worked hard but no other groups seem to think we understand hard. We been heavily culled and forced to migrate and murdered forever but using lies to cause guilt that is unearned and cruelty using on our children. I understand why there is war and it's about genetics and using.  Does guilt ever kick in in your minds. Our own leaders allowed this and allowed the brain damage of our most intelligent through immunizations.

It's been a term associated with slums and places people were forced to live versus chose to live for as long as I can remember, that it's almost synonymous with slums here in the US. (In fact, we use it to describe slums here in the US.) And, yes, I'm well aware that Ghetto was first used to describe Jewish settlements in Italy. But Ghettos weren't places we chose to settle, they were places we were told we could only live within Italy under the medieval Catholic Popes. \n\n\nBy the way, if you get the chance, go visit the Ghetto in Venice when all of this COVI-19 stuff is over.
