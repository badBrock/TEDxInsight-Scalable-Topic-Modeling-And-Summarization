Amazing. This is true. Sometimes things happen that arent positive but out of every negative thing that happens there is a seed of opportunity for growth and change. I am happy these people were able to put their differences aside and were able to do what's best for the child. I am going through something similar however i don't want to be enemies with the mother of my children. I will always love her and respect her for everything she gave me.. Powerful & Amazing. I can’t take a guy with dreads and a Detroit hat on on a ted talk seriously at all sorry 👎👎👎. How They Both Move Close To Each-other As They Talk 🥺. Now these are 2 beautiful grown black adults...not Cardi B and Offset lol. Thank you.. I think it's so wonderful how they are speaking to an audience but really to each other. So it's genuine. And it makes their message so relatable. Parents need to watch this.. Two min in and I’m wishing all women would think this way. 50 50 parenting support... I’ll stop there or I’ll rant...😖. Beautiful. 😅that’s a gorgeous woman. We’d have to just work that out lort! Lol. ㅠ. Who else fell in love with this family's hair. 'good job baby'. That was very inspiring and agreed with a lot they said. But didnt agree that you just let a child do exactly what they want when they want. The supermarket being a strong point, I just didn't agree with this statement. Is it ok to let your child still eat with their hands like an animal so they couldn't use a fork when their older. Theres elements where you cant just let a child do what they want when they want. The supermarket comment I found very strange. Your educating you're child how to behave in society et cetera. Just struggled with that statement. If that's her view on a supermarket then apply that to everything else in life. Just doesn't work that way.. This is truly beautiful and a lot of take homes for someone raising a Queen just embarking on this co-parenting journey. I can, and will do better. Thank you x. My son’s father and I had an on again off again abusive relationship. It was difficult, to say the least, when we split up after 6.5 years. In a lot of ways I still have love for him, but we were always better friends than we were in a relationship. It does make our current relationships hard at times. But, as we tell our son, the one thing we all agree on is that we love our little boy. Our son has four parents & doesn’t have any memory of what it was like before. For him, it’s always been that way & always will be. We get looks & comments all the time from people who don’t understand how we co-parent. We even call each other mom & dad in public. A child can never have too many people who love him. During my pregnancy that’s what I wished for; “I want him to have more love, more friends & family, than he knows what to do with.” This wasn’t the future we had imagined while waiting for our baby to arrive, but for as long as we keep love in our hearts, so shall it be.. You make so much as a parent only by not talking bad about the other parent with your kid. My parents can have opinions about each other and that affects my perception very much, but luckily they never trashed each other, because that must feel like you can't count on your parents or as if you had no one to trust.. Why do they...both talk like this...where they pause...at unnatural spots?. My ex isn’t about equality... I digress... 😫. i totally agree with your comment. If they let the kid be free spirit at anything, why do they pick clothes for him for school etc. ? you can't just let kid running in mall, first of all child can be abducted by predator, second it can cause harm to someone in the shop or himself. I can't remember the movie or tv series, but there was this kid that parents let him do whatever he wants to do because he's a free spirit and it turned out to be a little spoiled brat that no one liked. And this mantra they gave at the end? like whaaat? You know a lie repeated 100 times becomes a true? If he repeats himself or parents tell him that he's awesome, smart, genius, uberhuman, he's gonna start to believe it and think that he already is the greatest so he doesn't need to achieve anything more in life.... sad, but i hope the boy will achieve great things in life, not repeating his parents mistakes and having a straight thinking.. Why are we quiet in supermarkets? It is not a library where people need silence to focus. So, why do we have to be quiet in supermarkets? Because everyone does it, so we should all do it? Have you been to an Asian market? It is teeming with hustle and bustle and chaos. Fully grown adults are screaming, haggling, laughing, running, bumping into each other. Is this behavior strange? Is this behavior wrong? So, why should we teach a child that it is wrong to express themselves? There is something to be learned about respect, this is true. But maybe the child will learn to respect people in other ways in their life, and not from a scolding in a supermarket.. @scalpel  I dont disagree but with limits. A child bounding about in a supermarket as she allows could do serious harm to a little toddler or an elderly person. Let alone heavy products in the aisles that could fall and crush them. She almost had me but then it almost felt like lazy parenting.. They are giving a speech. You need to pause at certain times to give a speech.. @Ty-iz9wd  
Not...the way....they do it.. This is exactly what I told my ex I wanted if we ever split. He was never mature enough to handle something like this. Our daughter is now 24 and I always wonder how different her life would have been had we coparented like this. Low key teared up when they did the affirmations. Black excellence personified. I’m not crying. You’re crying. The ending is beautiful!. I admire both of you. You’re a good example for being a good parents. Lovely watching and listening your video from the top of Italian mountain.. Awesome !. I repeated so many times, your wrong way, your own grapes, your own food.
I choose my apprentices in my own way which has nothing to do with you blacks apparently since you can't be reasonable by "book" wrote by myself. There is no "co" can be done. Can't it be more obvious?. Wow!!!!!. Thus the present generation has been produced
Is anyone surprised. That was so beautiful! Thank you TED!. "We honor each other's role in Sekyu's life" 

I love that statement. Respect comes before love, always. Blessings to this family.. This is incredibly helpful for people who suffer from co-parenting. That's the magic power of our kids that can change ourselves .. only in front of this power you can endure anything and give up all your needs ..!. These parents set an amazing example of not just co-parenting, but on being a good parent in general💖😊amazing talk. The world does not dispise black joy... Respect and sympathy are the keys for building a better relationship.. Wow, delete my comment, you disappoint me as well.
First, don't waste your time, of course, others. Your magic only works on "the animal level", which is like humans could be grown like Tarzan as well.
Moreover, when it comes to adversaries or allies, blacks asked national reparation for slavery while ignoring their ancient ancestors were alpha males who dominated the entire land of Africa, which was the reason why others walked out of Africa by risking their lives and built their homes on other continents and became other "races".
Second, I never said your magic works. How could I/anybody make anything based on a wrong/false thing? See, you have no clear thought of what you are doing and what others' saying. Not to mention that nobody has the responsibility to meet your expectation. Let alone, your expectation was only a one-sided imagination that only exists in your dream.
Third, easy come easy go, your laziness, fluke mind and to speculate advantage by trickery can only waste your time. Stealing others' results doesn't mean you really gain what you stole, let alone what you stole has nothing to do with the thing you wanted.
Forth, you have no clear thought about what you are doing which isn't a problem can be fixed by one or two magics. The hard way is the only way. Roman was not built in one day.. It's so good to see that there are others with the same mindset. 
This is the message I preach to the father of my sons but he does not have the ability as yet to look beyond that which he knows and the unfamiliarity of my concept to his person causes me to wonder if he is resilient to see things differently.  
My heart is firmed in the belief that making changes, makes the difference.  👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿. Beautiful!. Love this .. They should have avoided divorce.. Can't it be more obvious than your incoherent post? Yes.. Disagree.. 🎼Absolutely BEAUTIFUL💕🙏🏽. Nice. Now, this is a worthwhile TED Talk. I can appreciate their honesty, openness in public and desire to love their child more than they evidently could one another (although it sounds like they truly share a common love). Personally, I think It a shame that for whatever reason (none of our business what it is) they cannot be a "typical" family. However, they stand as a positive example for parents in the 21st century that share the marriage and parenting experience of Ebony Roberts and Shaka Senghor. May God bless and guide them and their son all together.. TED Talks are not as good as they used to be 🤦‍♂️. TED wouldn't it be lovely if we got to see the boy as a teen, young adult and as a father as well?. Black love on display, Amazing for the world to see. These parents are a role model for the world. Together in spirit for the child they created, even tho not together as lovers. I can't say enough about how this moved me. Thank you for allowing us on the magic!. I left the house 🏠 with out my charger cord or adult pampers some body 🙃 please help if this phone doesn't stay charged 😑. Thank you for being brave enough to be authentic. Your example as two individuals United is beautiful. He is a very fortunate little boy.
Be Safe. 😷 
Peace. 🎶. Amazing! Thankful to the wonderful parents for sharing their story. I hope and pray people in these situations benefit from this Ted Talk. This young king will benefit greatly because his patents have chosen to put him first!. You sound so sweet, awesome.. 😜
Just give them the aspirations in full swing.... 😍
Love is passion
Love is kind
Love always protects........ 
Love always saves......... Yeah very crucial video for today's generation of parents..very informative...thumps up..
#Enlightened Beings. Accepted. Address the abuse . U address the problem. Yes u do ....it's time to see jessie. You are beautiful. What a beautiful 💓 writer. A child cannot have too many people who love them. The best environment a child can have is parents who respect each other. And not to forget that a child learns more from what the parents are than what they teach 🖖. Yes preach it. Surely 'co-parenting' means parenting.. Excellent message and talk. Comes across very genuine. Thank you.. Beast Mode is just there so he won’t get fined.. Idk this talk is dilute, watery weak, with clear reading-off-script errors. The race politics thrown in like "a world against black joy" is also Ludacris. TED needs higher quality material instead of these soapy opera-ey filler talks.. from the talk: "raising a black boy in a society that despises black joy....... blacks only seen has profitable or disposable"

I can't believe TED allowed a talk with such blatant spin on the modern world.

Occasionally you get a good scientific one but lately it's been neo liberal postmodern diatribes by yuppies or racist minorities. @ChurchOfThought  indeed, that is the part I didn't like. If they'd left that out it would've been great.. So he will learn murder is cool?. ODW: I understand what you mean. I agree... the best we can do as parents is guide our children to have the greatest understanding of what is right in their own hearts. To nurture that innocent heart at the center of the child’s being... to give them the clearest understanding of the world we ourselves created as a community of people among people... to remain strong-spirited in the crowd of naysayers. Children are innocent and will go astray without a well defined path for them to choose as they form and reach for their goals.. I could see him itchin for skittles the whole speech. Yall powerful i appreciate yall. Had to be black people?. I wonder if either of them moved on relationship wise or even remarried and how that affected things... I'd like to hear more.. Be mother without control!???? I want to see her when the boy be a teen. It's so cute how they all have dreds yall.😭. Why couldn’t I have had these two for my parents. Absolutely amazing. 💖💖💖. I would have loved to co-parent with my ex-wife unfortunately the b** did me dirty in the divorce, and somehow got it to where I couldn't have my daughter for visitation until she could talk when she was 4 years old so she could say what was wrong with her.  Like me, my mother, and my grandmother had no clue on how to raise a child. After that relationship was broken it never mended. My daughter will be 23 this year and I haven't actually talked to her since she was 15. Her mother convinced her I only wanted her when it was convenient and she hasn't matured enough to realize how much bullshit her mother fed her. however she had no problem calling me in February and asking for $4,000 so she could move to Connecticut, with her younger sister.. https://youtu.be/mCYFxt_9aco. PRICELESS. As this example takes hold in the hearts and minds of the many, the World will be changed. Thank you!. This is so powerful!. What wisdom they have shared! 

Thank you!. ❤. Wach my videos,they will put a smile. Yeet. Goosebumps throughout this whole speech 😭😭❤️❤️. Luckily her mom didn't die -)


like if you feel bad for Shaka as a kid ;). Hi. Thanks for liking my comment😊
Have a wonderful day!!. Detroit. 10 minutes away from 14 and mound. YES.. Gwendolyn Williams  
It is refreshing to see a black family with a mother and a father, despite them not being married. In my life and the lives of those that I know, such a trait is a *rarity*.. Ana Sylvia Hoppenbrouwers  ???. I've just made my comment with kinda summaries that angle.. Yes super cute how the murderer's son dressed just like his dad.. Dreds are unhygienic. Cute but nasty 😷. Gwendolyn Williams  I haven't committed any crimes. I don't really understand your sentence, could you please use correct grammar?. @The_Stocc  Lol you think you are going to win an argument on YouTube through pedantry. NOW that's cute! 😺. @ChurchOfThought No, I genuinely don't understand it. I don't want to assume what it means.. Church Of Thought thats a common misconception (or maybe yours or those your around are like that) cuz most ppl with locs take care of them 🤷🏽. The guy needs a haircut ASAP.. Love them who you have ,all that matters is love.. Because they're doing this for clout. 100% guarantee they don't actually do the positive things they claim.. Anoop Dubey has to work on a. This is so powerful ... Felt like watching a Dr. Phil episode.... 3 likes 0 views? 🤔. Early. Just amazing!. First. One of the Best speech I've ever heard! 🇺🇿🇺🇿🇺🇿🇺🇿. Wow sir. Hi first. It's the way they're counted and validated by the system... happens often on low view counts. Youtube has been around for decades and folk like you still think you've found something profound because you CBF doing homework about how the two stats are incremented?. The best. She's bomb. But black folks give entertainment. Enjoy. Yeah you are right guys
