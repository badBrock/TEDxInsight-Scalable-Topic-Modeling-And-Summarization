         "{good programme,, Dr. Thomas Campbell, Director of the Metropolitan Museum in New York, explains the relationship between room sized palatial tapestries and their narrative design and how the narratives invite us to look at objects in museums.  He initiates his talk with an admonition against situating ourselves in art historical rhetoric and looking at objects, allowing them to tell us their stories.  Dr. Campbell explains how he took this kind of a narrative, which is of course in his field, and expanded this aesthetic view to other diverse objects in the encyclopedic Met.  He embraces media, such as YouTube to interest viewers in the age of technology with the kinds of histories objects tell.  However, what is really exciting is relating the objects viewed on a video monitor or cell phone to visiting the museum and becoming excited with the experience of looking at the actual object and experiencing the authenticity of that object as well as its placement in a historical narrative context.  This is brilliant because  he makes the information in art accessible to everyone., <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuYzOn0U2PY&amp;t=88\">1:28</a> LOL, Thomas P. Campbell: Dropping the f-bomb at TedTalks and still manages to stay classy as fuck., sexsuality, The web is great... but nothing replaces, 3d, touching... smells, the sounds in the rooms... how they echo... the sounds of whispers and chatting...

Awk ward!!!!, I really want to go to the natural history museum in London.\n\nThere&#39;s one piece in my lbrary recently of a stuffed rare oil bird from Africa, I was looking at it for about 5 minutes. Just so real, and no jpeg can match it - I could easily spend a year in the natural history museum not bored., Funny to see that viewers don&#39;t know whats happenng:), LOL In Russian Bakhanal is pretty regular word, and you don&#39;t have to be bookworm to know it., thanks.\n, Please, someone make a 3 second clip of that phrase.

Man&#39;s intervention in the process is not NATURAL.  Domesticated animals are the species that we selectively breed and artificially farm for our own needs and purposes.  Natural selection also applies to plants.  Corn, as we know it, did not evolve to the point where it is today.  We selectively bred it to our purposes.  That is not evolution, but human engineering. , @axelasdf\nI will agree that evolution stops for a species when that species goes extinct, but this is not only self-evident, but also irrespective of whether the cause was conscious or an unguided natural process. Nowhere in the theory of evolution does it state that man&#39;s actions outside of evolution, whether by definition or in practical terms. Evolution is at the core of artificial selection in domesticated animals, and every bug we squash changes that species&#39; pedigree.}"

But it is very difficult for one 1. to understand what they do is wrong, unethical, inhumane and extreme and unimaginable violence, 2. to self-reflect and find a way out, 3. to be a normal person again, 4. to be treated as a normal person again. It is not someone&#39;s fault to look at you in a certain way for your past actions, even though they were in the past. No one is so pure to ignore your past and just look at your present. It is easy to be blinded by the circumstances, power, money, fame, any materialistic gain. So, it is really really important to consider each and every decision you make because most of the times it is too late to get out or change (as opposed to never too late). And this is to every human irrespective of race, religion, etc. At the end of the day, every religion in the world that stands firm today is only because of Love, Compassion and Empathy. Self-Love and Love for Others is the only way out for Human race and into a very long, bright and positive future., Respect Manwar. We are all getting into a polarised position..
